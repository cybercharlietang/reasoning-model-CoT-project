    "text": " The same goes for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the question is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Let me think.\n\nSo, the expression is a product of two binomials raised to powers: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since multiplication distributes over addition, the entire expression will be the product of all possible terms from each binomial expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I can consider the parts of the expansion that contribute to this term and ignore the rest.\n\nLet me break it down. First, let's handle \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient here is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm wondering if this part contributes anything to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), right? So, any term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will involve powers of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but not \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). That means that when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion.\n\nBut since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that means we need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is a constant term, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by this constant term, it will remain as \\(a^2b^2\\), and all other terms involving \\(c\\) will have extra factors that we don't want.\n\nSo, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me use the binomial theorem again for this. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), including the constant term 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term from the other part is 20, so multiplying them gives 120. That seems right because when you multiply the two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, but since we're only interested in the term where the \\(c\\) exponents cancel out, that's the only contribution to \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yeah, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. I considered both expansions separately, found the necessary coefficients, and multiplied them together. So, I'm confident that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Next, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

    "text": " Similarly, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can also be expanded using the binomial theorem. \n\nWait, but the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think I need to focus on the part of the expression that involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) first. Since the expression is a product of two binomials raised to powers, maybe I can handle each part separately and then multiply the coefficients.\n\nLet me start with expanding \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\). \n\nCalculating that, \\(\\binom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part.\n\nNow, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to expand this as well. Using the binomial theorem again, this becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nHmm, but wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the second part, I think that the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms directly. So, when I multiply the two expansions together, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can treat the two parts separately because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\).\n\nThat means, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but wait, no. Actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. However, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part and \\(c\\) is in the second, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). So, when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's actually the coefficient from the first part times the entire second part, but since we're just looking for the coefficient, not the entire term, I think I might have made a mistake here.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k \\times \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(k = 2\\) in the first part, and then multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the second part has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. \n\nBut wait, that doesn't seem right because the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and when you expand it, the sum of all coefficients would be when you set \\(c = 1\\). So, evaluating \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 (from the first part) times 64, which is 384. But that seems too high, and I think I might have made a mistake here.\n\nWait, no, actually, I think I'm confusing something. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which are powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because each term in the second part is a coefficient times \\(c^{\\text{something}}\\), so when you multiply, \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each of those coefficients, and since we're collecting all the coefficients for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nBut the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too large. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Since the two parts are multiplied together, and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, while \\(c\\) is in the second, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is simply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second expansion. But since the second expansion is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. It says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", but in the entire expression, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So, maybe the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it doesn't specify. Wait, no, the problem is exactly as stated: \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, perhaps the answer is just the coefficient from the first part, 6, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me think differently. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's 6 multiplied by the entire second expansion, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the question is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps I'm supposed to consider only the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., where the exponent is zero, so that \\(c^0 = 1\\). That way, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion.\n\nAh, that makes more sense. So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the same as \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is the middle term when the exponent is zero. Let me calculate that.\n\nUsing the binomial expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) times 20 (from the second part), which is 120.\n\nWait, that seems more reasonable. So, I think I made a mistake earlier by considering the sum of all coefficients, but actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the entire second expansion is multiplied by the first, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire second expansion. But that can't be because the second expansion is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 1, so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me confirm this. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. So, in this case, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by every term in the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that contradicts the earlier approach where we considered only \\(c^0\\).\n\nI'm getting confused here. Let me try to clarify the problem statement again. It says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 (c + 1/c)^6\\)\". So, in the entire expression, which is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). When you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which are various powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is not just a single number because \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is ambiguous unless it specifies a particular power of \\(c\\).\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but as it stands, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the question is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). That would make sense, and that's what I calculated earlier as 120.\n\nWait, let me check that approach again. If I'm looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, then the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean summing over all possible \\(c\\) exponents, then it would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems unlikely because the problem didn't specify any \\(c\\) exponent.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 (c + 1/c)^6\\)\". So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, which includes \\(c\\) terms. So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{m}\\) or something like that. Wait, no, actually, the product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\), so each term in the product will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the terms will be \\(a^{4 - k}b^k \\times c^{6 - 2m}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6.\n\nSo, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then I need to consider all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire second expansion, which would give a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, but then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, the problem didn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so perhaps it's intended to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). That would make the coefficient 6 * 20 = 120, as calculated earlier.\n\nWait, let me try to think differently. If I consider the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\((c + 1/c)^6\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean that we're treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable and considering the coefficient as a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, I think the intended answer is 120, considering the constant term with respect to \\(c\\).\n\nWait, let me try to confirm this by expanding both parts separately and then multiplying. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), has the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second part, \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), and \\(1/c^6\\). So, when I multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each of these terms from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times each of these coefficients, but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying a power of \\(c\\), perhaps it's considering all these terms together, which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, another way to think about it is that since the two parts are multiplied together, and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so we need to find the term in the product where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\binom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0 \\Rightarrow m = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\binom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both expansions:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

But since the question is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\). Let me think about that.\n\nSo, the expression is a product of two binomials raised to different powers: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part and \\(c\\) is in the second part, maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I can just find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then consider how it interacts with the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but since it's a product, each term from the first expansion will multiply each term from the second expansion. However, since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe I can treat them separately.\n\nLet me break it down. First, I'll find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Then, I'll find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(c^0\\) is 1, which means that term doesn't affect the power of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it will just contribute to the coefficient. Alternatively, maybe I need to consider all terms in the second expansion, but since the first part only has \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), their variables are different, so the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) won't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, no. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression multiplies each term from the second. So, if I have \\( (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^4 \\binom{4}{k} a^{k}b^{4 - k} \\) and \\( \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\binom{6}{m} c^{m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{6 - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\binom{6}{m} c^{2m - 6} \\). So, when I multiply these two, each term is \\( \\binom{4}{k} a^{k}b^{4 - k} \\times \\binom{6}{m} c^{2m - 6} \\).\n\nBut I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the first expansion, \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), because \\(a^k b^{4 - k}\\), so when \\(k = 2\\), it's \\(a^2b^2\\). The coefficient there is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply this term by each term from the second expansion, which is \\( \\binom{6}{m} c^{2m - 6} \\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, right? Because each term in the second expansion will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\), and since \\(c\\) is a different variable, the exponents of \\(c\\) don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). Because when \\(c = 1\\), each term becomes \\(\\binom{6}{m} \\times 1^{2m - 6} = \\binom{6}{m}\\), so the sum is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\binom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(\\binom{4}{2} \\times 64\\).\n\nLet me compute that. \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\), and \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that approach. Another way to think about it is that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. In this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term in the second polynomial that has \\(c^0\\) will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) without changing the exponent of \\(c\\). So, perhaps I should only consider the term in the second expansion where \\(c^0\\), which is when \\(2m - 6 = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient there is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(\\binom{4}{2} \\times \\binom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, now I'm confused because I have two different answers: 384 and 120. Which one is correct?\n\nLet me think again. The first approach was that the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, so multiplying by that gives 384. But the second approach was that only the term where \\(c^0\\) contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) because otherwise, the exponent of \\(c\\) would be non-zero, so \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), making it a different term. Therefore, only the term where \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial affects the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product.\n\nSo, which is correct? Let me see. When you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^{2m - 6}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by \\(c^{2m - 6}\\), but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero. So, \\(2m - 6 = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2} \\times \\binom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but in the first approach, I thought that since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), all terms in the second polynomial would contribute to it, but that's not correct because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^{2m - 6}\\), the resulting term is \\(a^2b^2c^{2m - 6}\\), which is a different term unless \\(2m - 6 = 0\\). So, only the term where \\(m = 3\\) contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the correct coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me test this with an example. Suppose I set \\(c = 1\\), then the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times (1 + 1)^6 = (a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this case would be \\(\\binom{4}{2} \\times 64 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But when I set \\(c = 1\\), I'm effectively summing all the coefficients of the second polynomial, which gives me 64, and then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384. However, when I set \\(c = 1\\), I'm not just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but the entire expression evaluated at \\(c = 1\\). So, in that case, all terms are multiplied by 64, which affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as well. But when I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the original expression, without substituting any values, I should only consider the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the correct approach is the second one, where only the term with \\(c^0\\) contributes, giving a coefficient of 120.\n\nWait, but now I'm getting conflicting results depending on whether I substitute \\(c = 1\\) or not. Let me clarify. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the coefficient when you multiply the two expressions together, keeping track of all variables. So, each term in the expansion is a product of a term from the first polynomial and a term from the second. For the term \\(a^2b^2\\) to appear without any \\(c\\) terms, the second factor must contribute a term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power. Therefore, the only term that contributes is when \\(2m - 6 = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Thus, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2} \\times \\binom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nAlternatively, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\), I get the sum of all coefficients, which is 64, and then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) becomes 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But this is because substituting \\(c = 1\\) effectively multiplies each term by 1, so all coefficients are scaled by 64. However, in the original problem, we're not substituting \\(c = 1\\); we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\). Therefore, only the term where \\(c^0\\) contributes, so the correct coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the exponents of \\(c\\) don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is simply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2} \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because coefficients are numerical, not expressions. So, perhaps I need to evaluate the second polynomial at \\(c = 1\\) to get the sum of its coefficients, which is 64, and then multiply by \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\) to get 384.\n\nWait, but that approach would give me the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when all \\(c\\) terms are set to 1, which isn't the same as the coefficient in the original expression. So, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the term in the second polynomial where \\(c^0\\), which is when \\(m = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2} \\times \\binom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me check with a small example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\(a c + a \\times 1/c + b c + b \\times 1/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a b\\) is zero because there is no \\(a b\\) term. But if I were to compute the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product, it would be \\(c + 1/c\\), and similarly for \\(b\\). But in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), not a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the approach of setting \\(c = 1\\) to get numerical coefficients is valid only when you're evaluating the entire expression, but when you're looking for the coefficient of a specific term without any variables, you need to consider only the terms where the variables cancel out.\n\nSo, in our original problem, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find the term in the second polynomial where \\(c^0\\), which is when \\(2m - 6 = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2} \\times \\binom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but if I set \\(c = 1\\), then the expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 2^6 = (a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\binom{4}{2} \\times 64 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But this is different from 120. So, which is correct?\n\nI think the confusion arises from whether we're evaluating the entire expression at \\(c = 1\\) or just looking for the coefficient of a specific term. If we set \\(c = 1\\), we're effectively summing all the coefficients of the second polynomial and then scaling the entire first polynomial by that sum. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) becomes scaled by 64, giving 384. However, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the original expression without substituting \\(c = 1\\), then we need to consider only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is when \\(m = 3\\), giving 120.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand it, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, and it's multiplied by each term from the second expansion. However, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a constant with respect to \\(c\\), so when we multiply it by terms involving \\(c\\), it creates terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), where \\(k\\) is some exponent. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually zero because \\(a^2b^2\\) is not multiplied by any \\(c^0\\) term unless we specifically have \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term will have a different exponent of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to a different term in the product. But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself is only present when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so only when \\(2m - 6 = 0\\), which is \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\binom{4}{2} \\times \\binom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but if I set \\(c = 1\\), then the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But that seems contradictory. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Is the problem asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\), or is it asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\)? Wait, no, the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which implies that it's looking for the coefficient when the term is \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). But in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only appear if there's a \\(c^0\\) term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product and looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), so in the product, it's only present once, multiplied by the \\(c^0\\) term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused because when I set \\(c = 1\\), I get a different result. Let me try to clarify. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply the two polynomials, the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2} \\times \\binom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the correct coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part and identifying the relevant terms.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**  \n   Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**  \n   We seek the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.

The coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**  \n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Similarly, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can also be expanded using the binomial theorem. But wait, the question is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term is specifically from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), right? So maybe I don't need to worry about the other part involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). \n\nLet me confirm that. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is just from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms involving \\(c\\) raised to some power. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, its coefficient in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second expansion will multiply with each term in the first. Wait, no, actually, that's not quite right. Because the entire expression is a product of two expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but actually, no. Because when you multiply, the terms combine in a way that each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is if the term from the second expansion is a constant term, i.e., \\(c^0\\), because then when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by that constant, you still have \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, first, let me find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). So, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs is when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2\\). The binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6.\n\nNext, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nNow, since the two expansions are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients I found: 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the first part's coefficient is 6, and the second part's constant term coefficient is 20, so when you multiply them together, you get 120. That seems right. Alternatively, if I think about the entire expansion, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. But only the constant term in the second part will contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product, because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, making the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is not zero. Therefore, only the constant term contributes, and so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in calculating the binomial coefficients. For the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. That's correct.\n\nFor the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Then, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20, which is correct. So, 20 is the coefficient of \\(c^0\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\).

The other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), might not directly affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but I'll have to see how it interacts when multiplying the two expansions together.\n\nLet me recall the binomial theorem.

That means I don't need to consider all the terms in the second expansion; I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the appropriate term from the second expansion that doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts. Hmm, actually, since the second expansion only involves \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), which are separate variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the multiplication should just result in the product of the coefficients from each part. \n\nSo, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first expansion, and it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, I think it means the coefficient when considering all possible terms, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient would just be the product of the coefficient from the first expansion and the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. But since the second polynomial only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nBut wait, actually, that might not be correct. Because each term in the second expansion is a power of \\(c\\), which is separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so when you multiply, each term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are powers of \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that would mean we need to consider all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that seems like the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first expansion times the entire second expansion, which is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a numerical value, not a polynomial in \\(c\\). \n\nWait, maybe I misinterpret the question. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which includes all the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are usually constants or expressions without variables. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. In that case, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each expansion. \n\nWait, let me clarify. The original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\text{term from first expansion} \\times \\text{term from second expansion}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, and when multiplied by the entire second expansion, it becomes 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 \u00d7 (c\u2076 + 6c\u2074 + 15c\u00b2 + 20 + 15/c\u00b2 + 6/c\u2074 + 1/c\u2076). \n\nSo, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's actually 6 times the entire second expansion, which would mean the coefficient is 6(c\u2076 + 6c\u2074 + 15c\u00b2 + 20 + 15/c\u00b2 + 6/c\u2074 + 1/c\u2076). But that seems too complicated, and the problem probably expects a numerical coefficient. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Wait, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which implies that it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), but that's not standard. Usually, coefficients are for specific terms, so maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, meaning that it's the sum of all coefficients where the term is \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, let me check: the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of its coefficients is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, that seems high. Let me think again. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), so the sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by 64, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) becomes 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. So, is that the answer? \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's just the coefficient from the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion, which would be 6 \u00d7 \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's not a numerical coefficient; it's a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). That would make more sense. \n\nIf that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. In the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Setting the exponent equal to zero: 6 - 2m = 0 \u21d2 m = 3. So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. \n\nBut the problem didn't specify the power of \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe it's expecting the coefficient to include all powers of \\(c\\), which would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384, but that seems too large. Alternatively, if it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6, but that seems too simple. \n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't standard. Usually, coefficients are constants. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is written incorrectly, and it should specify a particular power of \\(c\\). But assuming it's as written, I think the most reasonable interpretation is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would mean I'm looking for all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is 6\\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, meaning that it's considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the entire second expansion. But that seems odd because coefficients are usually numerical. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial. However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then it would make sense. But since it's not specified, I'm confused. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by another expression. But that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is the product of the two expansions. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and the question is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which is unusual. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is the same as the coefficient in the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Since the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), then the coefficient would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. \n\nWait, that seems plausible. So, if I consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, then it would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. \n\nBut let me verify this approach. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). The product P(a, b) \u00d7 Q(c) will have terms where each term of P is multiplied by each term of Q. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's equivalent to taking the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) and multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in Q(c). \n\nIn this case, P(a, b) = (a + b)^4, and Q(c) = \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) is 6, and the sum of coefficients in Q(c) is obtained by setting c = 1, which gives (1 + 1)^6 = 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if I wanted the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for a specific \\(k\\), I would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b), which is 6, and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in Q(c). But since the problem doesn't specify \\(k\\), I think the intended interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384. \n\nWait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think of a simpler example. Suppose I have (a + b)^2 \u00d7 (c + 1/c)^1. What's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Well, in this case, (a + b)^2 = a\u00b2 + 2ab + b\u00b2, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, that's not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, let's take (a + b)^1 \u00d7 (c + 1/c)^1. The coefficient of \\(a^1b^1\\) would be 1 (from (a + b)) multiplied by the sum of coefficients in (c + 1/c), which is 2. So, the coefficient would be 2. But if I actually multiply them out, I get (a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c. There is no \\(a^1b^1\\) term; instead, each term has either \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), not both. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^1\\) is zero, which contradicts the earlier approach. \n\nHmm, so my earlier approach might be flawed. It seems that just multiplying the coefficients doesn't work because the variables are separate. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually zero because in the product, each term has either \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), but not both. Wait, no, that's not the case. \n\nWait, no, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the product is a combination of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, for example, a term could be \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^6\\), or \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut that's a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). As I calculated earlier, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, so the coefficient would be 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^{10}\\) or something similar, but as it stands, it's \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nGiven that, I think the most reasonable interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 \u00d7 \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since that's a polynomial, and the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient, I must have made a mistake in my approach. \n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which means that it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but without specifying \\(k\\), it's impossible to determine. Therefore, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, which would mean the coefficient is 6, but that seems too simple. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible terms, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but in my earlier example, when I had \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^1b^1\\) was zero, not 1 \u00d7 2 = 2. So, that approach must be wrong. Therefore, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first expansion, 6, because the second expansion only affects the \\(c\\) terms, not the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. \n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term is a combination. So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually 6 times the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial. \n\nBut if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the constant term in \\(c\\), then it's 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. \n\nGiven that the problem didn't specify the power of \\(c\\), I think the intended answer is 384, as it's the coefficient when considering all powers of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanding, each term is of the form \\(a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m} \\times \\dbinom{4}{k} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). \n\nSo, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient from the first expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, for each \\(m\\) in the second expansion, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), which is 6 \u00d7 2^6 = 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " The same goes for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I might not need to expand the entire expression, just the parts that contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nLet me start by looking at the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, substituting \\(k = 2\\), the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6, and the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\).\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider how this term interacts with the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, wait a second, \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), so when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the result will be terms involving \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms at all because they won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term directly. \n\nWait, actually, that's not quite right. Let me think again. The entire expression is the product of two expansions. So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all the terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are such that they don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But actually, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is a standalone term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\). However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think I need to consider the sum of all the coefficients from the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion, because each term in that expansion will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\), contributing to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nWait, no, that might not be correct. Let me clarify. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms in each polynomial that multiply together to give that specific term. In this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the result will be a term of the form \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{-k}\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find all terms in the product where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out, i.e., where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That means I need to find the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because only that term, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will result in \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms.\n\nSo, to rephrase, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nI already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's tackle that.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded as the sum from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term) and 20 (from the constant term in the \\(c\\) expansion). So, multiplying them together: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. When we multiply these two expressions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the same as \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), we only consider the term where the second expansion contributes a \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms that multiply to give that term. In this case, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and the constant term from the second polynomial. So, yes, 6 times 20 is 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by multiplying the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. Constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiply these coefficients: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

That means I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms at all, right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so the part of the expression that includes \\(c\\) might just multiply by 1 or something. Let me think about that.\n\nSo, starting with the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\).

I need to figure out how this affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, since we're only interested in the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient from this part is just 1? Or does it contribute something else?\n\nWait, no. Actually, the entire expression is a product of two parts: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply them together, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is a constant term, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a constant, it will still be \\(a^2b^2\\), but if we multiply it by a term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), it would become \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), which are different terms.\n\nSo, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem. The expansion is the sum from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term: \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\): \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original expression: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Since these two terms multiply together when we consider the entire expression, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of these two coefficients.\n\nSo, multiplying 6 by 20 gives 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). And in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when we multiply these two parts, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part gets multiplied by 20, giving 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right.\n\nI don't think I missed anything here. The other terms in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would introduce powers of \\(c\\), which would change the term \\(a^2b^2\\) into something else, so they don't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the only contribution comes from the constant term, which is 20, multiplied by 6 from the first part.\n\nSo, yeah, I think 120 is the correct coefficient. I don't see any errors in my reasoning.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. The product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " The same goes for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but the question is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term is part of the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), right? So maybe I don't need to worry about the other part with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). Let me think. If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will just contribute a coefficient that I can multiply by, but since the problem doesn't specify any particular term involving \\(c\\), maybe I can consider the entire expansion of the second part and just take the coefficient from the first part.\n\nWait, no, actually, the problem is the product of both expansions. So the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will multiply every term from the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that means regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Or does it? Wait, no, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, that might not be right. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), will contribute some coefficient, but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's just the coefficient from the first part, and the second part's entire expansion will just multiply it. But that doesn't make sense because the problem is the product of both, so each term in the product will be a combination of terms from both expansions. So if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I have to consider all possible terms from the second expansion that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), give a term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, but the exponents of \\(c\\) can be anything because the problem isn't specifying anything about \\(c\\). Wait, but that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some coefficient that includes the contributions from the second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\), so the product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{something with } c\\). So maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem doesn't specify \\(k\\), so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, no, looking back at the problem: it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the product. So that would mean that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in the product, but since the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would give a term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some coefficient from the second expansion. So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, I need to take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is \\((a + b)^4\\), and multiply it by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient for each such term is just the coefficient from the second expansion, and since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's the sum of all those coefficients.\n\nWait, but that might not be correct. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, since the first part is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), the cross terms don't interfere. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is a separate variable. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part contributes a coefficient that multiplies \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, so first, let me find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^4 \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs is when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNow, the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of all the coefficients in this expansion would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), because that makes each term just its coefficient. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1/1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me verify that. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes a coefficient, and since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's effectively the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. So, 6 * 64 = 384. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\binom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\binom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so from the first part, the coefficient is 6. From the second part, each term contributes a coefficient of \\(\\binom{6}{m}\\) times \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum over all possible \\(m\\) the coefficients from the second part. So, that sum is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\binom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^4 \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Finding the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of all coefficients in an expansion can be found by setting the variable to 1.

I'm a bit confused here because this part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, maybe I don't need to expand this part because it doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Hmm, so does that mean the coefficient from this part is just 1? Because if I don't touch it, the entire expression would be multiplied by 1, right?\n\nWait, no, that can't be right. Because if I don't expand the second part, then when I multiply the two expressions together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the term from the second part must be the constant term, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nAlright, so let me apply the binomial theorem again to \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). I need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\).

So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from both parts.

But actually, no, that's not quite right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when we multiply by the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it's like each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct either. Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in one part is multiplied by the coefficient of a specific term in the other part. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term involving \\(c\\) from the second part will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\), but \\(a^2b^2\\) itself isn't affected by the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the question is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that seems too simplistic because the entire expression is a product, so each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which means that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by all the terms from the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms don't influence the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient remains 6.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since the second expansion includes terms with different powers of \\(c\\), the overall expression will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, giving 384. But I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.\n\nWait, no, I think I'm confusing the concepts here. Let me clarify. The coefficient of a term in a product of two expressions is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so in the second expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term that would multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) is the constant term, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term with \\(c^k\\), the result will be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but if I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then I need to consider all terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nAh, that makes more sense. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me compute that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That is, \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from the other expansion with coefficient 20. When you multiply these two terms together, you get \\(6 \\times 20 \\times a^2b^2c^0 = 120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply together to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial by the constant term from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is just 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nSo, after going through this step by step, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we use the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " The same goes for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\) at all, right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part is multiplied by that. So maybe I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the terms from the second part could affect the coefficient. Or maybe not? I'm a bit confused.\n\nLet me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So when you multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So that would be the term where the first part is \\(a^2b^2\\) and the second part is any term from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that means I'm considering all possible terms where the first part is \\(a^2b^2\\) and the second part can be any term. So the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes its own coefficient, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a single term, its coefficient gets multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me check. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^4 \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\). \n\nNow, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem. It would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nSo when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nBut wait, let me think again. Is that correct? Because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term's coefficient contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So yes, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is just one term, its coefficient in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try another approach. The entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the \\(c\\) terms don't affect it. So perhaps I can treat the \\(c\\) part as a separate factor and just compute the coefficient in the first part, then multiply by the entire second part. \n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient is \\(6\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which isn't a number. So that can't be right. I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. So 6 times 64 is 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me write out the product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I expand both, then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present in \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and when multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each term's coefficient will add to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. But actually, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a single term, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that each term in the product is \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges accordingly. But since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), that occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so \\(m\\) can be anything, but the coefficient would be \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. So yes, 6 times 64 is 384. \n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct. Let me compute \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The sum of the coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So yes, the sum is 64. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384. So I think that's the answer. \n\nBut wait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there a possibility that the \\(c\\) terms could affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term? No, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), so when you multiply it by any term in the second expansion, the coefficient just gets scaled by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nSo I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in this reasoning. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem and properties of polynomial multiplication.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^4 \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), giving the coefficient:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not any terms involving \\(c\\), I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that might not be right. Let me think again.\n\nActually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is being multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term, we get a term that's just a multiple of \\(a^2b^2\\), whereas multiplying by other terms would introduce \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), which we don't want.\n\nSo, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is:\n\\[\n\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so:\n\\[\n6 - 2m = 0 \\implies 2m = 6 \\implies m = 3\n\\]\nSo, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\n\\]\nWait, hold on, 6! is 720, but 3! is 6, so 6!/(3!3!) is 720/(6\u00d76) = 720/36 = 20. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That is:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6, correct. Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), correct. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120.

But wait, the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think I can handle each part separately and then multiply them together, focusing only on the terms that will contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nLet me start with the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). Now, I need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), which means that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, plugging in \\(k = 2\\), the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, the expansion is the sum from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all, I need to consider how this part affects the overall coefficient. Wait, actually, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the expression is the product of two separate expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. However, since we are only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can consider the terms in the second expansion that are constants, because any term involving \\(c\\) would result in a term that includes \\(c\\) in the product, which we don't want. So, we need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nTo find the constant term, I can set the exponent of \\(c\\) to zero. From the general term \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\), we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(2m = 6\\) which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the constant term in the second expansion is 20.\n\nNow, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first expansion, and the constant term from the second expansion, the overall coefficient will be the product of these two coefficients. So, 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part) gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Is the constant term the only term that will contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term? Because when we multiply the two expansions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, if we have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and a constant from the second part, then yes, that's the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\). If we took a term with \\(c\\) from the second part, that would introduce \\(c\\) into the term, which isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing any other contributions. Suppose we take a term from the first expansion that's \\(a^2b^2\\) and multiply it by a term from the second expansion that's, say, \\(c^k\\), then the resulting term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is not \\(a^2b^2\\) unless \\(k = 0\\). So, yes, only the constant term in the second expansion contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, another thought: Could there be any other terms in the first expansion that, when multiplied by terms in the second expansion, give \\(a^2b^2\\)? For example, if we take a term with \\(a^3b\\) from the first expansion and multiply it by a term with \\(b\\) from the second expansion, but wait, the second expansion only has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), not with \\(b\\). So, no, the second expansion doesn't have any \\(b\\) terms, so the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the first expansion's \\(a^2b^2\\) term multiplied by the second expansion's constant term.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nLet me break it down. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). So, first, I can find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then, since the other part is multiplied by this, I need to consider how that affects the coefficient. Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is the product of the two expansions. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when multiplied, will contribute a term that might not involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Wait, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, does that mean we need to consider all possible terms from the second expansion and multiply them by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion? Hmm, no, that seems off.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the terms from the second expansion that don't involve \\(c\\) would just be 1, but actually, the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so it doesn't have a constant term unless the exponents cancel out. Wait, so maybe the only term in the second expansion that is a constant (i.e., no \\(c\\) terms) is when the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel each other out. So, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when we have three \\(c\\)s and three \\(1/c\\)s, right? Because \\(c^3 \\times (1/c)^3 = c^0 = 1\\). So, the coefficient of that term would be the number of ways to choose three \\(c\\)s and three \\(1/c\\)s from six terms, which is \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\), and then multiplied by \\(1^3 \\times 1^3\\), which is just 1. So, the constant term is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, when we multiply the two expansions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 20 times the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\).\n\nSo, let me compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^n\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{k}b^{n - k}\\). So, for \\(n = 4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\binom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, since we're multiplying this by the constant term 20 from the second expansion, the overall coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, the first part gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives 20 for the constant term, so when multiplied together, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. Let me just double-check the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nThe expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{k} \\left(1/c\\right)^{6 - k}\\), which simplifies to \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{2k - 6}\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(2k - 6 = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the term is \\(\\binom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\). The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives the coefficient \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " The same goes for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think I can handle each part separately and then multiply them together, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me break it down.\n\nStarting with the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\). So, the coefficient for each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\), and the term itself is \\(a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\). Since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), that means we need the term where \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, this expands to the sum from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) and a power of \\(c\\) as \\(6 - 2m\\).\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term is purely in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\). So, when we multiply the two expansions together, we'll have terms that are products of terms from each expansion. However, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the only way for the product to have \\(a^2b^2\\) is if the term from the second expansion is a constant term, i.e., \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the product would have \\(c\\) terms as well. So, I think I need to find the term in the second expansion where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0.\n\nLet me set the exponent equal to 0: \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(m = 3\\) will be the constant term. The coefficient for this term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient for the constant term in the second part is 20.\n\nNow, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can consider that when we multiply the two expansions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we only want the term that doesn't introduce any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factors, we only take the constant term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient will be the product of the coefficients from each part.\n\nSo, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which happens when \\(m = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when we multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part gets multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions. Since the variables are different, the only way for the product to have \\(a^2b^2\\) is if we take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and the constant term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. The key was realizing that since the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part by the constant term from the second part. So, it's just a matter of finding those two coefficients and multiplying them together.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for each part separately.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\).

That term is only in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), right? Because the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when we multiply them together, the variables involved will be \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) in it, so maybe I'm supposed to consider the expansion such that when multiplied by the second expansion, the \\(c\\) terms cancel out? Wait, no, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be a part of the first expansion, and when multiplied by the second expansion, which has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), unless we're looking for the coefficient in the entire product, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, maybe I need to think about how the entire expression is a product of two expansions, so each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and multiply it by a term from the second expansion that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). But wait, the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, will have terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\), each multiplied by some coefficients. So, the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) in the product is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion, which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, first, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), and then find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply those two coefficients together to get the final coefficient in the product. Let me write this down step by step.\n\nFirst, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, which states that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^k\\). So, in this case, \\(x = a\\), \\(y = b\\), and \\(n = 4\\). The general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). We're interested in the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so \\(a^2b^2\\). That would correspond to \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, plugging in \\(k = 2\\), the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, \\(c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the constant term. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we need to multiply the coefficient from the first part by the coefficient from the second part. That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything here. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. When we multiply these two terms together, we get \\(6 \\times 20 \\times a^2b^2 \\times c^0 = 120a^2b^2\\). Since \\(c^0 = 1\\), this term is just 120a^2b^2. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120.\n\nBut wait, just to double-check, is there any other way that \\(a^2b^2\\) could appear in the product? For example, could there be terms from the second expansion that when multiplied by terms from the first expansion result in \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is zero? Well, since the second expansion only contributes terms with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), and the first expansion only contributes terms with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion by the constant term from the second expansion. So, I don't think there are any other contributions to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, 120 should be the correct coefficient.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about the entire expansion as a product and see if the multiplication affects anything else. Let me try that. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I were to expand both separately, I would get two polynomials multiplied together. The first polynomial has terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When multiplying them, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the only term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is the constant term 20. Therefore, the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(a^2b^2 \\times 20\\), which gives \\(20a^2b^2\\). But wait, that would mean the coefficient is 20, not 120. Wait, no, that contradicts my earlier conclusion. Hmm, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, no, actually, the coefficient from the first expansion is 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the coefficient from the second expansion for \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two terms together, you get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) times \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 120. I think my confusion came from thinking that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, but actually, the 6 is the coefficient from the first expansion, and 20 is from the second, so their product is 120. So, yes, 120 is correct.\n\nLet me just recap to make sure. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Since these two terms are multiplied together in the product, their coefficients multiply as well, so 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. I think that makes sense. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning now.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we consider the expansions separately and then combine the relevant coefficients.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   - Using the binomial theorem, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\).\n   - Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   - The term with \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\\).\n   - Coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients:**\n   - Multiply the coefficients from both expansions: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"

Let me write that out using the binomial theorem. So, it would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\). I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I guess I should find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, I think it does because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second part, but only considering the terms that don't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), right?\n\nWait, no, actually, no. Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit off because the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so maybe the expansion with \\(c\\) doesn't affect it. Wait, no, that can't be right because when you multiply, you have terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^6\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1/c^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. But the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part? That seems confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, since the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the entire second expression, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire product, but since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the same as in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is not a single number. So that can't be right either.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of the entire expression, treating all variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as separate. But that would mean the coefficient would involve terms with \\(c\\), which isn't what is being asked. Hmm, maybe the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the second part? But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. Since the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a number. So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because \\(c\\) is a different variable. But that seems odd because the problem includes both parts.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is written incorrectly, or I'm misinterpreting it. Alternatively, perhaps the question is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the coefficient where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, so \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, perhaps I need to consider both expansions and find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\).\n\nLet me try that approach. So, first, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) separately, then multiply them together, and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\).\n\nStarting with \\((a + b)^4\\), as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nNow, let's expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, this would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 because we're looking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\).\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that's not right. Wait, 6! is 720, but 3! is 6, so 6 \u00d7 6 is 36, and 720 \u00f7 36 is 20. So, yes, the coefficient is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20.\n\nNow, since the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, that's 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), which is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), etc., down to \\(c^0\\). But since we're only interested in the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, we only take the term from the second part where \\(c^0\\) occurs, which is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it again. Let me think: in the entire product, each term is a product of a term from the first part and a term from the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes different powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be a sum of terms involving different powers of \\(c\\), each multiplied by 6. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a single number, not a polynomial in \\(c\\).\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make the coefficient a number, 120, as I calculated earlier. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, but that seems too simple given the structure of the problem.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. But in the product, each term is a combination of terms from both parts, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are usually constants. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120, as I calculated earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because \\(c\\) is a different variable. But that seems odd because the problem includes both parts. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating all variables as separate. So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is a distraction. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable that can take any value, so the coefficient would actually be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a function of \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck here. Let me try to think of it another way. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would involve considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which again doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant. But that seems too simple, and the problem includes both parts, so I think that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable that doesn't interact with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a number, which doesn't fit the question.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but considering only the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). So, that would mean finding the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which would be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering only the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), is 120. Therefore, the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, to recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is the product of the two coefficients, which is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering only the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, it's 6, but that seems too simple given the structure of the problem. So, I think the intended answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check once more. If I consider the entire product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually a sum of terms involving different powers of \\(c\\), each multiplied by 6. So, the coefficient isn't a single number but a polynomial in \\(c\\). Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we consider the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\).\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. Multiply the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Similarly, the other part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can also be expanded using the binomial theorem. \n\nBut wait, the problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term is only present in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), right? Because the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), involves variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms when looking for \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nLet me confirm that. If I'm looking for a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), that term must come from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part, when multiplied, will just contribute some constants or other variables that aren't \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, perhaps the coefficient I'm looking for is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the other part can be considered as a constant multiplier. \n\nWait, but actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second. So, if I'm looking for a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), it can only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part and the constant term (i.e., the term without \\(a\\) or \\(b\\)) in the second part. Because any other term in the second part would introduce \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which we don't want. So, actually, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nHmm, okay, so I need to compute two things: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then multiply them together to get the final coefficient. \n\nLet's start with the first part: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, which states that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, in this case, \\(n = 4\\), and we want the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would correspond to \\(k = 2\\), because the exponent of \\(b\\) is \\(k\\), and the exponent of \\(a\\) is \\(4 - k\\). So, when \\(k = 2\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2} b^{2}\\). \n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nOkay, that was straightforward. Now, moving on to the second part: finding the coefficient of the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, this expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k - k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). \n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of the constant term is 20. \n\nNow, since the original expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients we found from each part. That is, 6 multiplied by 20. \n\nCalculating that, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. \n\nWait, let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. For the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed when \\(k = 2\\), and \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6. For the second part, looking for the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20. Multiplying them gives 120. Yeah, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 120.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"

    "text": " The binomial theorem says that each term in the expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{n}{k}a^{n - k}b^k\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to \\(n\\). \n\nSo, applying that to \\((a + b)^4\\), I can write out the expansion. The general term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I'm specifically looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), which means \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is also squared.

So, does that mean I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms at all? Hmm, let me think.\n\nActually, no, I think I might be misunderstanding. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply these two expansions together, I have to consider how the terms interact. But wait, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's being multiplied by terms from the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. That means I'm looking for all the terms where the product results in \\(a^2b^2\\). However, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second part, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't change. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. \n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the second expansion, which is in terms of \\(c\\), then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), I think I need to consider that each term in the second expansion will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient will be the product of the coefficients from both expansions.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct either. Because in the entire expression, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be the sum of all products where the first part contributes \\(a^2b^2\\) and the second part contributes any term, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so multiplying by any term in the second expansion would just add a factor to the coefficient. \n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term, not considering \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, meaning the coefficient when you multiply the two expansions together, but only considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when you multiply by 6, that would give the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all terms involving \\(c\\).\n\nBut let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so it's possible that the answer is just 6, because the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), and the problem might be considering the coefficient without regard to the \\(c\\) terms. But that seems unlikely because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients are combined.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me consider the entire expression as a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When you multiply them together, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which are of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nNow, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64.\n\nSo, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me check that again. Because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those terms, the coefficients add up. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be 6 multiplied by 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so it's considering all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient is the product of the coefficients from both parts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first expansion, and the second expansion is multiplied by it, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire second expansion. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. It says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", but in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). So, actually, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only be the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, because otherwise, it's a different term.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, actually, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion.\n\nSo, let's break it down:\n\n1. Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as calculated before.\n\n2. Coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find this, we can use the binomial theorem again. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20.\n\nNow, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is the product of the two coefficients: 6 (from the first expansion) and 20 (from the second expansion). So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nLet me just double-check that. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. When you multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, giving a total coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part. \n\n1. From \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. From \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nMultiplying these coefficients gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

That makes sense because only then will the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, leaving us with just \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nAlright, so let's break this down. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Then, find the coefficient of the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Finally, multiply these two coefficients together to get the desired coefficient.\n\nStarting with the first part: the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, which states that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^{k}\\). So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\). We need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), which means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\).

So, the coefficient of the constant term in the second expansion is 20.\n\nNow, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, we multiply the coefficients from both parts. That is, 6 (from the first expansion) multiplied by 20 (from the second expansion). \n\nCalculating that:\n\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\nWait, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the first part is straightforward: \\((a + b)^4\\) has a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has a constant term when the exponents cancel out, which happens when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nI don't think I missed anything here. Each step seems logical. First, find the coefficient in each part, then multiply them together because when you multiply the two expansions, the coefficients multiply for the corresponding terms. Since we're only interested in the term where the \\(c\\) exponents cancel out, that's why we needed the constant term from the second expansion. \n\nSo, I'm confident the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we first determine the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNext, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which happens at \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nMultiplying these coefficients together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."
