    "text": " Similarly, the term \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can also be expanded using the binomial theorem. But wait, the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is part of the first part of the product, right? So maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms when looking for \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think about that.\n\nSo, the expression is a product of two separate binomial expansions: one in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all different variables, their exponents won't interfere with each other. That means, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can treat the two parts separately. That is, first find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but wait, no, actually, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part is multiplied by it, but since the other part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's actually just the product of the coefficients. So maybe I can find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient is just a number, not involving \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nLet me break it down. The expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So when you expand both, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, and the second part doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the entire expansion of the second part would involve terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which would mean the coefficient would actually be a sum of products, but since we're looking for a specific term, maybe it's more complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. The question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), and any power of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, actually, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because then the coefficient would be a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not involving any variables. So maybe I'm wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, without considering the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is simply the coefficient from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, because the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, in that case, I can find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and that would be the answer.\n\nLet me verify that. Let's consider that when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times 64.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because when you expand \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a certain number, say \\(C\\), and then when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by all the terms in the second expansion, each with their own coefficients. Therefore, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(C\\) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64.\n\nSo, first, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs is when \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6.\n\nNow, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), as I thought earlier. So, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the part of the expansion that doesn't involve \\(c\\). But no, because the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) contributes a factor to each term in the product. So, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. So, 6 times 64 is 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, since the first polynomial only has \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second only has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), there's no overlap in variables. So, actually, when you multiply them, the terms in the first polynomial are independent of the terms in the second. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because then the coefficient would include terms with \\(c\\), which it shouldn't. Wait, no, the coefficient is a scalar, so when you multiply by the entire expansion, you're actually summing all the possible products. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6 times 64 is indeed 384.\n\nWait, but let me consider an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1)^1\\). The expansion would be \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, but that's a different case because the second expansion doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero. But in our problem, the second expansion doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), but multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that can't be right because the second expansion doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest of the terms would involve \\(c\\). Wait, no, because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, each with their own coefficients. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6 times 64 is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with a smaller exponent to see if this makes sense. Suppose we have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion of \\((a + b)^2\\) is \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and the expansion of \\((c + 1/c)^1\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\). When multiplied together, the product is \\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\), which expands to \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product is zero because there's no term with both \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\). So, in this case, the coefficient is zero, which contradicts my earlier reasoning because the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the first part is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 2, so 1 times 2 would be 2, but the actual coefficient is zero. Therefore, my earlier reasoning must be wrong.\n\nWait, that's a problem. So, in this smaller example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero, even though the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the first part is 1 and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 2. So, that suggests that my initial approach is incorrect.\n\nSo, where did I go wrong? Let me think again. In the smaller example, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because there's no term with both \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) in the product. Each term in the product has either \\(a^2\\), \\(ab\\), or \\(b^2\\) multiplied by a term involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), but none have both \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) together. Therefore, the coefficient is zero.\n\nSo, in the original problem, \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but in the smaller example, that approach gave the wrong result. So, perhaps that approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify: when you have two separate variables, the terms in one expansion don't affect the exponents of the other variables. So, in the product, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nBut in the smaller example, that approach would suggest that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 1 times 2, which is 2, but in reality, there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient is zero. Therefore, my approach must be wrong.\n\nWait, so perhaps the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is only the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because \\(c^0\\) is the only term that doesn't change the exponent of \\(c\\), so that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion. But in reality, each term in the product is a combination of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, if I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but in the smaller example, that approach gave the wrong result. So, perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nWait, let's reconsider the smaller example. Let me write out the product explicitly:\n\n\\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c) = (a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\).\n\nExpanding this, we get:\n\n\\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\).\n\nNow, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would require both \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) in the same term, but in this expansion, each term has either \\(a^2\\), \\(ab\\), or \\(b^2\\) multiplied by a term in \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). There's no term that has both \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed zero.\n\nBut according to my earlier approach, the coefficient should be the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the first expansion (which is 1) multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second expansion (which is 2), giving 2, which is incorrect. Therefore, my initial approach is flawed.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is zero because there's no way to get both \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) from the first expansion and have them multiplied together without involving some combination with the second expansion. Wait, but in the first expansion, \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) exists, but when multiplied by the second expansion, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion, which would mean that the coefficient is the same as in the first expansion, but multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second expansion. But in the smaller example, that approach failed because the coefficient was zero, but according to this reasoning, it should have been 2.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the concept. Let me think again. When you have two independent variables, the exponents in one don't affect the exponents in the other. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20c^0\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be multiplied by each of these, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion. But since the second expansion is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a scalar. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a scalar, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0, respectively. In that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion.\n\nIn that case, let's compute that. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the middle term, which is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify any exponent for \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion, which would be a sum over all exponents of \\(c\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the second part. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts in the product.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include all possible exponents of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would appear multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each with their own coefficients. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nBut in the smaller example, that approach gave the wrong result because the coefficient was zero, but according to this reasoning, it should have been 2. So, perhaps the confusion is about whether the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of other variables or specifically with certain exponents for those variables.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion, but that would result in a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a scalar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. In that case, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each expansion where the exponents match. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, so the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible exponents of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to think differently. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. In this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion by any term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nSo, in the smaller example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^2\\) is zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, no, \\((a + b)^2\\) has \\(a^2\\), \\(2ab\\), and \\(b^2\\), but no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the coefficient is zero, which matches the earlier result. So, in that case, the approach would be correct because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is zero, so the product would also have zero as the coefficient.\n\nBut in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, so the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in the smaller example, the sum of coefficients in the second part is 2, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is zero, so the total coefficient is zero, which is correct. So, perhaps my initial approach was correct.\n\nWait, but in the smaller example, when I multiplied \\((a + b)^2\\) by \\((c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is zero, which is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (zero) multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second part (2). So, 0 * 2 = 0, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) where the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that in the smaller example, the coefficient should be 2, but that's not correct because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion, so the product can't have it either. Therefore, my initial approach seems correct.\n\nSo, to confirm, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Therefore, in our problem, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with another example to be sure. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^3 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). The expansion of \\((a + b)^3\\) is \\(a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero. The sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^2\\) is \\((1 + 1)^2 = 4\\). Therefore, according to my approach, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 0 * 4 = 0, which is correct because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion, so the product can't have it either.\n\nAnother example: \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, the sum of coefficients in the second part is 2, so the coefficient in the product would be 6 * 2 = 12. Let's expand it explicitly:\n\n\\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nMultiply by \\((c + 1/c)\\):\n\nEach term in the first expansion is multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so:\n\n\\(a^4c + a^4/c + 4a^3bc + 4a^3b/c + 6a^2b^2c + 6a^2b^2/c + 4ab^3c + 4ab^3/c + b^4c + b^4/c\\).\n\nNow, looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we have \\(6a^2b^2c\\) and \\(6a^2b^2/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6c + 6/c\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of \\(c\\), then perhaps it's considering all possible exponents of \\(c\\), which would mean the coefficient is \\(6(c + 1/c)\\). But that's not a numerical coefficient; it's a term involving \\(c\\).\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify any exponent for \\(c\\), so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is indeed \\(6(c + 1/c)\\), but that's not a scalar. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. In that case, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each expansion where the exponents match.\n\nSo, in the first expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), as calculated earlier. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so perhaps it's ambiguous. However, given that the problem includes both \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), it's possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial. But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the term \\(c^0\\) is indeed the middle term, which is 20. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then the answer is 120. However, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion, which would be a polynomial, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nTherefore, the problem is likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. But wait, let me check the problem again: it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, it's not specifying any exponent for \\(c\\), which suggests that it's considering all possible exponents of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion, which would be a polynomial. But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nIn that case, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), so the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut in the smaller example, when I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is zero, which matches 0 * 2 = 0, so that seems correct.\n\nWait, but in the smaller example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is zero, so the product's coefficient is zero, which is correct. Similarly, in our original problem, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but that's only if we're considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for a specific \\(k\\). If we're considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's the sum over all \\(k\\) of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nTherefore, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in the smaller example, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is zero, which is 0 * 2 = 0, correct.\n\nSo, I think that's the correct approach. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given product is 384.\n\nBut let me just double-check everything once more to be sure.\n\nFirst, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nThe sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 * 64 = 384\\).\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n  "

So maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts. Let me check that.\n\nFirst, let's focus on \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term from the first part of the product, I think the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient should just be 6 times whatever the coefficient is in the second part for the constant term, because if we multiply by 1 (the constant term), it won't change the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. \n\nWait, is that right? Let me think. When we multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, I need to find the term in the second part that is a constant (i.e., where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) because that's the only term that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) will still give \\(a^2b^2\\). If there's a \\(c\\) term, it would introduce \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) into the product, which would change the variables we're looking at.\n\nSo, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. Therefore, the constant term in the second expression is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, that would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). Let me calculate that: 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nI don't think I missed anything here. The \\(c\\) terms in the second part don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms because we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), so the rest of the terms would involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which we don't want. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by expanding each part separately. Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So maybe I can first expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and then see how it interacts with the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nLet me start with \\((a + b)^4\\). The binomial theorem tells me that \\((a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\).

Again, using the binomial theorem, this expands to \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nWait, but in the original problem, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will multiply each term from the second expansion. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), we need to find the terms in the second expansion that are constants (i.e., where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero). Because when we multiply a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) by a constant term from the second expansion, it will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the final product. \n\nSo, let me find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. From the general term, we have \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). Setting this equal to \\(c^0\\), we get \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we have \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). \n\nTherefore, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\), which is just \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the constant term in the second expansion is 20. \n\nNow, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part.

Now, that part seems straightforward. \n\nBut wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think the next step is to figure out how this multiplication affects the coefficient we just found. \n\nLet me think. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nHowever, the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).

So, does that mean that the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will just be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to consider how the second expansion affects the overall coefficient.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is a separate variable. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Wait, let me check the problem again. It says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms. That is, when you multiply the two expressions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to sum up all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the 6 we found earlier.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. Because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^5\\), etc. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only be present if the second expansion contributes a term with \\(c^0\\), i.e., \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nAh, that makes sense. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to compute 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nNow, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\).

Wait, actually, let me compute that again. 6! is 720, and 3! is 6, so 720/(6*6) is 720/36, which is indeed 20. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from the second expansion with coefficient 20.

Let me just double-check my steps. First, I expanded \\((a + b)^4\\) and found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) to be 6. Then, I considered that this term would be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find the term in the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term.

So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be \\(6\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not correct either because the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) are separate and don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\).

But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that is, all terms where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be \\(6\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, that's not correct because the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has terms with coefficients, but when you multiply by 6, you'd have to sum all the coefficients of the second expansion and then multiply by 6 to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But that seems complicated. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, it's considering all possible terms where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared, but \\(c\\) can be anything. So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But let's check what the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is. The sum of coefficients is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, that seems too high. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, without considering the \\(c\\) terms. That is, it's treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable and wants only the term where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. But I'm not entirely sure if that's what the problem is asking.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which includes terms with \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term from the second expansion, which has \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\). Therefore, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be \\(6 \\times\\) the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, but in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Because each term in the second expansion contributes to a term in the product with \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nBut the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But I'm not entirely confident about this. Let me think differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all terms, but only focusing on the \\(a^2b^2\\) part and ignoring the \\(c\\) part. That is, it's treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable and just wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384.\n\nBut wait, let's consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients of the product are convolutions of the coefficients of the factors. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum over all terms of the product of coefficients from the first expansion and the second expansion, but only when the product results in \\(a^2b^2\\). However, since the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and multiply it by any term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384.\n\nBut wait, another way to think about it is that the entire expression is the product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because when you multiply by the second expansion, you're effectively scaling each term by all possible coefficients from the second part. So, yes, 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for a specific \\(k\\), then it would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms, I think it's 384.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure. Let's consider a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)^1\\). Expanding this, the first part is \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and the second part is \\(c + 1/c\\). So, the product is \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product is zero because there are no \\(a^2b^2\\) terms. Wait, but according to my earlier logic, the coefficient would be 1 (the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the first expansion) times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), so 1*2=2. But in reality, there are no \\(a^2b^2\\) terms because the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, my earlier logic must be flawed.\n\nWait, in this simpler example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because \\(a^2b^2\\) can't be formed by multiplying \\(a^2\\) or \\(b^2\\) with the second expansion. So, in the original problem, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and multiply it by any term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. But in the simpler example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion (which is 1) times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion (which is 2), so 1*2=2. But in reality, in the product, there are no \\(a^2b^2\\) terms because the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, this suggests that my earlier logic is incorrect.\n\nWait, in the simpler example, the product is \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)\\). The expansion is \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). There are no \\(a^2b^2\\) terms because you can't multiply \\(a^2\\) by \\(b^2\\) because the second expansion doesn't have \\(b^2\\). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero. Therefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because the second expansion doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. Wait, but that contradicts my earlier conclusion.\n\nWait, no, in the original problem, the first expansion has \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second expansion has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion contributes to a term in the product with \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the simpler example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 1 (from the first expansion) times 2 (sum of coefficients in the second expansion), giving 2. But in reality, in the product, there are no \\(a^2b^2\\) terms because the second expansion doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, this suggests that my earlier logic is incorrect.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum over all terms of the product of the coefficients from the first and second expansions, but only when the product results in \\(a^2b^2\\). However, since the second expansion only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), and not \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and multiply it by any term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion will contribute to a term in the product with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, in the simpler example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 1*2=2, but in reality, there are no \\(a^2b^2\\) terms because the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Wait, but in the product, you do have \\(a^2b^2\\) terms multiplied by \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 2, but the problem is that in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself (without any \\(c\\) terms) doesn't exist. Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's actually zero because there are no terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\), then it would be 2.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the question is \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so it's ambiguous. But in standard terminology, when asking for the coefficient of a term in a product of polynomials, it's usually considering the term with all variables, so in this case, \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but if it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), then the coefficient would be zero because there's no such term without \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for it, implying that there is a non-zero coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384.\n\nBut to make sure, let me think about how the product works. The first expansion is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in terms of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(6a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). Therefore, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), meaning the sum of all coefficients where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Since the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), the coefficient would be 6*64=384.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by expanding each part separately and then considering the product. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " Similarly, the other part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can also be expanded using the binomial theorem. \n\nWait, but the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term is only going to come from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), right? Because the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't interact with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, no, that doesn't sound quite right. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply, you just take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term and multiply it by every term in the second expansion, which would just add up all the coefficients from the second expansion. \n\nWait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) and I expand it, I get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), etc. Similarly, the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms involving \\(c^6\\), \\(c^5 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c}\\), and so on, down to \\(c^0\\) which is 1. So when I multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that means we need the part where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. Because any other term involving \\(c\\) would result in a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) times something with \\(c\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, I think I was wrong earlier. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nOkay, so let me break this down. First, I'll find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^n\\) is the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(n\\) of \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, for \\(n = 4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(n - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, that would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. Again, using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the sum from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, meaning \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient from the second part is 20.\n\nNow, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, we multiply the coefficients from each part. So, that's \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait a second, let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes here. So, in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 because \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In the second part, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them together gives 120. That seems correct. I don't think I made any errors in the calculations. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by taking the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiplying it by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, both coefficients are 6 and 20, respectively. Multiplying these together gives 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Similarly, the expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can also be expanded using the binomial theorem. \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in a separate part of the expression. Let me think. The entire expression is the product of two binomials: one involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I expand each part separately, the coefficients from each expansion will multiply together. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps I can find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and then multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because the \\(c\\) terms won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms when multiplying. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product, so each term in the first expansion will multiply each term in the second expansion.

Let me try to break it down. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I expand both, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But I'm only interested in the terms where the product has \\(a^2b^2\\). So, for that, I need to find the term in \\((a + b)^4\\) that gives \\(a^2b^2\\), and then multiply it by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not correct because when you multiply two terms, their variables multiply as well. So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and then I multiply by a term from the second part, say \\(c^k \\times (1/c)^{6 - k}\\), which simplifies to \\(c^{2k - 6}\\), then the resulting term would be \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{2k - 6}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so any term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) would still have \\(a^2b^2\\) as part of it. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, no, that doesn't sound right. Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients don't just add up like that. Let me think again. Each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is of the form \\(\\binom{4}{k} a^{k} b^{4 - k}\\), and each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is of the form \\(\\binom{6}{m} c^{m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{6 - m} = \\binom{6}{m} c^{2m - 6}\\). So, when you multiply these two terms together, you get \\(\\binom{4}{k} \\binom{6}{m} a^{k} b^{4 - k} c^{2m - 6}\\).\n\nNow, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from the case where \\(k = 2\\) in the first expansion, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is the term when you choose \\(a\\) twice and \\(b\\) twice. So, the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. Then, for each \\(m\\) in the second expansion, we have a term \\(\\binom{6}{m} c^{2m - 6}\\). So, when we multiply the term from the first expansion by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\binom{4}{2} \\times \\binom{6}{m}\\) for each \\(m\\), but we need to sum over all \\(m\\) because each \\(m\\) contributes a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, every term in the product that has \\(a^2b^2\\) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) term. So, the total coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because for each term in the second expansion, when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get a term \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\), and the coefficient for each of these would be \\(\\binom{4}{2} \\times \\binom{6}{m}\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) term, we need to sum over all possible \\(m\\) the coefficients from the second expansion. Wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the product would be \\(a^2b^2c^{2m - 6}\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\binom{4}{2} \\times \\binom{6}{m}\\), because each \\(m\\) contributes a term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^{2m - 6}\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself is the sum of all these contributions. Wait, no, that's not right. Because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the same as the coefficient in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in the factors. So, if I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6 \\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\). Because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of those coefficients adds to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nWait, let me check that. Suppose I have two expressions: \\(A = a + b\\) and \\(B = c + 1/c\\). Then, \\(A^4 \\times B^6\\) would have terms where each term in \\(A^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A^4\\) is 6, as we saw before. Now, each term in \\(B^6\\) is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(B^6\\), you get terms like \\(6 \\times \\binom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{2m - 6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(6 \\times \\binom{6}{m}\\), because each term contributes a coefficient of \\(6 \\times \\binom{6}{m}\\) to the term \\(a^2b^2 c^{2m - 6}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, every term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the total coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m}\\). But the sum of the binomial coefficients \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m}\\) is equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the rest of the variables are \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are separate, maybe the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients from each expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the middle term, which is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but that contradicts my earlier reasoning. So which one is correct?\n\nWait, no, because if I only take the constant term, then I'm only considering the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, but the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, every term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), giving terms like \\(a^2b^2 c^{2m - 6}\\), each with their own coefficients. Therefore, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. So, as I thought earlier, it would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that seems high. Let me check with an example.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think differently. Let me consider that when you have two separate variables, \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is simply the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term in the second part. Wait, but that doesn't seem right either because the second part is not a constant. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), meaning that we can treat \\(c\\) as an independent variable, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all possible powers of \\(c\\) of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2 c^{k}\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of those contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nWait, but let me think about it another way. Suppose I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\), which matches my earlier calculation. So, that seems to confirm that the coefficient is indeed 384. But let me check with another approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in each part. But that would only be the case if the two expressions are multiplied together, but since they are separate variables, I think that's not the right approach.\n\nWait, no, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because each term in the second part contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), as I did before, then the second part becomes 64, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute it more directly. The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^k b^{4 - k}\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nThe expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{6 - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{2m - 6}\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of each term \\(c^{2m - 6}\\) is \\(\\binom{6}{m}\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply these two expansions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the sum over all \\(m\\) of the product of the coefficients from each expansion. That is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Coefficient of } a^2b^2 = \\binom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m}\n\\]\n\nWe know that \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me check with another approach. Let me compute the entire expansion step by step.\n\nFirst, compute \\((a + b)^4\\):\n\n- The expansion is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6.\n\nNext, compute \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\n- The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{6 - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{2m - 6}\\).\n\nSo, each term is \\(\\binom{6}{m} c^{2m - 6}\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will multiply each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6 \\times \\binom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{2m - 6}\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(6 \\times \\binom{6}{m}\\), which is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then yes, it's 384. But if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be different. In that case, we would need to find the term where \\(2m - 6 = 0\\), which is when \\(m = 3\\), so the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\binom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's indeed 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\), which matches our earlier result. Therefore, I think the correct coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have separate variables, you might only consider the product of the coefficients, but in this case, since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), I think it's correct to sum over all \\(c\\) terms. So, I think 384 is the right answer.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Let's compute the entire expansion:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15\\dfrac{1}{c^2} + 6\\dfrac{1}{c^4} + \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\n\\]\n\nNow, when we multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in:\n\n\\(6a^2b^2c^6 + 6 \\times 6a^2b^2c^4 + 6 \\times 15a^2b^2c^2 + 6 \\times 20a^2b^2 + 6 \\times 15a^2b^2 \\dfrac{1}{c^2} + 6 \\times 6a^2b^2 \\dfrac{1}{c^4} + 6 \\times a^2b^2 \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\)\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed the sum of all these coefficients:\n\n\\(6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6 = 6 + 36 = 42; 42 + 90 = 132; 132 + 120 = 252; 252 + 90 = 342; 342 + 36 = 378; 378 + 6 = 384\\).\n\nYes, that confirms it. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit unsure because sometimes when you have separate variables, you might not consider the sum of all coefficients, but in this case, since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think it's correct. So, I think the final answer is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts: expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) and expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^k b^{4 - k}\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{2m - 6}\n   \\]\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is:\n   \\[\n   \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient from the first expansion and the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

So, maybe I can first find the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and then focus on the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in that part. \n\nLet me recall the binomial theorem: \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{k} y^{n - k}\\). So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), each term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{k} b^{4 - k}\\). I need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would be when \\(k = 2\\), right? So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nBut wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to multiply this 6 by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), I think the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because we can't have a term with both \\(c\\) and \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe the \\(c\\) part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), because when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by every term in the \\(c\\) expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just 6 times the entire expansion of the \\(c\\) terms, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). Hmm, that seems confusing.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). So, perhaps I misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, so that the term is just \\(a^2b^2\\). That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't typical. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all the terms, but only the terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, that would mean I need to multiply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nYes, that makes more sense. So, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on that.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{6 - k}\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{k - (6 - k)} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{2k - 6}\\).\n\nSo, each term has an exponent of \\(c\\) equal to \\(2k - 6\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0, so we set \\(2k - 6 = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(c^0\\) is when \\(k = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as the product of two expansions, and when I multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

But wait, the problem is asking specifically about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nLet me think. Since the expression is the product of two binomials raised to powers, maybe I can handle each part separately and then multiply the relevant terms together. So, first, I'll focus on expanding \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). \n\nSo, the general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\).

Let me clarify.\n\nThe entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand both, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. However, the problem is only concerned with the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find all the terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), right? Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in one part is multiplied by all the terms in the other part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient will just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, no, that doesn't sound right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second part, the variables are independent. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that can't be, because the second expansion is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I expand both separately, the first part will have terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), etc., and the second part will have terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^5 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c}\\), \\(c^4 \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^2\\), etc. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, when I multiply the two expansions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But the problem doesn't specify, so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power. That would make sense because then it's a specific term. \n\nWait, let me check the problem again. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the entire second expansion, the coefficient would be the product of the two coefficients. \n\nWait, no. Let me think carefully. When you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power. That would make the term independent of \\(c\\), and the coefficient would be a number. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, and thus the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But I think the more likely interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), meaning it's multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient is a numerical value. \n\nWait, perhaps I should proceed as follows: First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I found earlier. Then, the entire expression is this coefficient multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but let me verify this. If I expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of all coefficients is indeed when \\(c = 1\\), so that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that when multiplying the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, perhaps it's expecting the coefficient multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, leading to 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I expand both, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a numerical value, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, as before. So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me check another way. Let's consider the entire expression as a product of two polynomials. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient accumulates as the sum of the coefficients in the second part. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 6 * (sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)) = 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute the entire expansion of the product and then find the coefficient, but that would be time-consuming. Alternatively, I can note that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient becomes 6 * \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, perhaps it's implying that we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product comes from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by each term in the second part. So, each term in the second part is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nBut the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) is equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\), as before. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nSo, after going through this reasoning, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Wait, actually, when I multiply the two expansions together, the terms from each will multiply, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), their coefficients shouldn't interfere. So maybe I can just find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. \n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials together, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second. So if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would come from the product of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), I think I can treat the two parts separately. That is, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then note that it will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\binom{4}{k}a^{k}b^{4 - k}\\) multiplied by \\(\\binom{6}{m}c^{m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{6 - m}\\), which simplifies to \\(\\binom{6}{m}c^{2m - 6}\\). \n\nBut since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find all terms where \\(k = 2\\) in the first part, because \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(k = 2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. \n\nNow, when I multiply this by the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in this expansion will have a coefficient \\(\\binom{6}{m}\\) and a term \\(c^{2m - 6}\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, that can't be right because the second part is a sum of terms, so I can't just multiply by the whole expansion. \n\nWait, no, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and when I multiply it by each term in the second part, it will create terms like \\(6 \\times \\binom{6}{m}c^{2m - 6}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the coefficients from the second part multiplied by 6. But that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems high. Let me check again. \n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but it's part of the entire product. So each term in the product will be a term from the first expansion times a term from the second expansion. So the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which includes different powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but that's not correct because the second part is a polynomial, not a single term. \n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the product of the coefficients from each expansion. That is, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) for any term is \\(\\binom{6}{m}\\), but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the total coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384, as I thought earlier. But I'm not sure if that's the correct approach because the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, but the way the problem is phrased, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) exponents. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so each term in the product would be \\(a^2b^2\\) times a term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would make the coefficient a sum of terms, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a single number, not a polynomial. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think differently. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, specifically from the term \\(\\binom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\), which is 6a^2b^2. Then, when we multiply this by the second expansion, each term in the second expansion will be multiplied by 6a^2b^2, resulting in terms like 6a^2b^2 \\times \\binom{6}{m}c^{m} \\times \\left(1/c\\right)^{6 - m}\\), which simplifies to 6 \\times \\binom{6}{m}a^2b^2c^{2m - 6}. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. That is, 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nThe sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part with coefficient 6, and when multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which has coefficients \\(\\binom{6}{m}\\), the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^{2m - 6}\\) would be 6 \\times \\binom{6}{m}\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of 6 \\times \\binom{6}{m}\\), which is 6 times the sum of \\(\\binom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m\\) from 0 to 6. \n\nBut the sum of \\(\\binom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m=0\\) to \\(m=6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\), so the total coefficient is 6 \\times 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but that seems correct because each term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by the first part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the entire second part is a separate expansion, so when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem: \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\). The entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a sum of coefficients equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Because the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).

Let me think about that.\n\nSo, if I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), the general term is given by the binomial theorem as \\(\\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4. I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\).

So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, since the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to consider how that affects the coefficient. But wait, when I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term is independent of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second expression doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), maybe the coefficient remains the same as in the first part.\n\nWait, let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

However, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a single coefficient, not a polynomial in \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the entire product.\n\nSo, breaking it down, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when I multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part will give me the constant term that, when multiplied by 6, will give me the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product.\n\nSo, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\) of \\(\\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Now, since the first part contributes 6 and the second part contributes 20, the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and \\(c^0\\) comes from the second part. When you multiply them together, you get \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\), and the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that when you have two separate expressions multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first expression and \\(c^0\\) is only in the second, their coefficients multiply to give the overall coefficient.\n\nSo, yeah, I think 120 is the correct coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem, which is 6. Then, we find the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

But wait, the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I might not need to fully expand both parts; instead, I can focus on the parts that contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) and then see how the other part interacts with it.\n\nLet me start with the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this expansion will have terms like \\(\\binom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\). Since I'm interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, let me find the coefficient for that term.\n\nThe general term is \\(\\binom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\). For \\(a^2b^2\\), I need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, substituting \\(k = 2\\), the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\binom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand this using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion will be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m}c^{6 - m - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWait, but in the problem, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). However, the second part involves \\(c\\) terms, which don't interact with \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). That is, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms.\n\nBut wait, that can't be right because the second part is being multiplied by the first part, so when we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But actually, since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's like each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all terms in the second part.\n\nBut hold on, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part? But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's written as \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, no, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". That suggests that in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but since \\(c\\) is separate, maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that seems odd because the coefficient should be a numerical value, not involving \\(c\\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the part with \\(a^2b^2\\) and ignoring the \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't make much sense either because the entire expression includes both parts. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.\n\nSo, the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), when expanded, gives terms with \\(a^4, a^3b, a^2b^2, ab^3, b^4\\), each multiplied by their respective coefficients. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, gives terms with \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, 1, c^{-2}, c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\), each multiplied by their coefficients.\n\nWhen we multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me double-check that. So, if I consider the entire product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion and is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), then we would need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion and multiply it by 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the middle term when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all terms in the other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be 6 multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient, not the entire expression, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and not considering the second part because it's multiplied by terms that don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). But that doesn't seem right because the second part is being multiplied in, so the coefficient should account for that.\n\nWait, let me look at the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part and \\(c\\) is in the second part, when you multiply them, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient in the first part, because the second part is just a constant factor (in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)).\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's as if each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is scaled by the entire expansion of the second part.\n\nBut wait, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is not a number but an expression. That can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nLet me try another approach. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, we're looking for all terms in the product that have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But again, that would result in a polynomial, not a single coefficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), that is, the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). In that case, we would need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion and then multiply it by 6. As I calculated earlier, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I'm not sure. Let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It just says \\(a^2b^2\\), so it might be considering all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought earlier.\n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient is 384, which is a number, but it's multiplied by all the terms in the second expansion. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a single number. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a number, so I must have misinterpreted the question.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as a variable separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120, as I calculated earlier. That seems more plausible because 120 is a reasonable coefficient, and it's a single number.\n\nBut the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I'm confused. Let me think again. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient would be the same for all those terms. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut that would mean that in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 * (each coefficient in the second expansion). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). So, the coefficient is 6 times the expansion of the second part, but that's not a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the second part is being treated as a constant.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because the second part is also being expanded. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which would be 120. Let me try to find that.\n\nSo, in the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when the exponent is 0. So, as I found earlier, that's when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the term is 20. So, when we multiply this by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part, which has a coefficient of 6, we get 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120.\n\nBut the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of it differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Since the product is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{6 - 2m}\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2} \\times \\binom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\binom{4}{2} \\times \\binom{6}{m}\\).\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\) times the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\binom{6}{m}\\). But the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\binom{6}{m}\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 120. So, which one is correct? It depends on what the problem is asking. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 384. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120.\n\nLooking back at the problem statement: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me double-check this reasoning. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all terms in the other polynomial. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But since we're looking for a numerical coefficient, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, since the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) contributes a factor that is the sum of all its coefficients (which is \\(2^6 = 64\\)), the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " Similarly, the expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can also be expanded using the binomial theorem. But wait, the question is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That seems to be part of the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), right? Because \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\) are in the second part. So maybe I don't need to worry about the second part when looking for \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, but the problem is the product of both expansions, so maybe I need to consider both parts together. Wait, no, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part because the second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply the two expansions, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will only come from the first part, and the terms involving \\(c\\) will come from the second part. But the question is about \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe the coefficient is just from the first part, and the second part doesn't affect it because \\(c\\) terms won't interact with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, but that doesn't sound right because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would come from multiplying the corresponding terms in \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from the first part, so the coefficient would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of the second part. But that seems confusing. Let me try to approach this more systematically.\n\nFirst, let's consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this is equal to the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). Now, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient here is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nNow, looking at the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), let's expand this using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is the sum from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that means we need to consider the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of all coefficients from the second part because \\(c^{0}\\) (i.e., the constant term) in the second expansion would contribute 1 when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, actually, that's not correct. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and when multiplied by each term in the second part, each term in the second part will contribute a factor involving \\(c\\), but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that can't be because the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be a term without any \\(c\\) dependence. Wait, no, that's not necessarily true. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. It says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) could be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, which includes different powers of \\(c\\). But if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would mean considering all terms where the power of \\(a\\) is 2 and the power of \\(b\\) is 2, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that's not possible because each term in the product will have some power of \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating again.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would involve multiplying each term from the first expansion by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term from the second part, each of which has a coefficient and a power of \\(c\\). But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would then be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because each term from the second part contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, that seems plausible.\n\nWait, let me clarify: When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the terms from each polynomial that combine to form that specific term. In this case, the specific term is \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms involving powers of \\(c\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second part. So, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients of these two terms.\n\nSo, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already determined is 6.\n\nNext, we need to find the constant term (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's find that.\n\nThe general term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so:\n\n\\(6 - 2m = 0\\)\n\nSolving for \\(m\\):\n\n\\(2m = 6\\)\n\n\\(m = 3\\)\n\nSo, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), and its coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the constant term in the second expansion is 20. So when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term, you get \\(6 \\times 20 \\times a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms that combine to form that term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expression and multiply it by the constant term from the second expression. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it: when you expand the product, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion is multiplied by every term from the second expansion, each contributing a coefficient and a power of \\(c\\). But if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then that would be the sum of all possible products where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. Wait, but that can't be because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), so when multiplied by any term from the second expansion, it would have a \\(c\\) component. So, perhaps the question is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem didn't specify \\(k\\). Hmm, that's confusing.\n\nWait, no, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which suggests that \\(c\\) terms are being ignored, but that's not standard. Typically, in such problems, you're looking for the coefficient of a specific term, including all variables. So, perhaps the problem is intended to have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), so the constant term. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which would give \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 would be 384. But that seems too high, and I don't think that's what the problem is asking because it specifically mentions \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply that \\(c\\) is involved as well, but the problem doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\). Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me try again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^{-m}\\), depending on the term. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from \\(k = 2\\) in the first expansion, and then multiplied by any term from the second expansion. But if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because each term from the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would contribute a coefficient, and since we're considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all \\(c\\) terms would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking because usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term, you're looking for a specific term, not the sum over all possible terms with different exponents. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), so the constant term, which would be the case where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120, as I thought earlier.\n\nLet me check this again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part with coefficient 6. The constant term in the second part is 20, so when multiplied together, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense because if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and we're considering the product, then the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   The general term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   The general term in the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0), which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\) gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient of this term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Let me calculate that.\n\nSo, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is the number of combinations of 4 things taken 2 at a time. I remember that \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me see if expanding this affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so when I multiply the two expressions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will come only from the first expansion, and the terms involving \\(c\\) will come from the second expansion. Therefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm not missing something. Does the second part affect the coefficient somehow? For example, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and any term from the second part, say \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), then the product would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), etc. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not any term that includes \\(c\\). So, does that mean I'm only considering the terms where the \\(c\\) parts cancel out, leaving just \\(a^2b^2\\)? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, no, actually, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would include all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Wait, that can't be right because then the coefficient would depend on \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for a numerical coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again: it says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), each term in the product will have some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. That doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all terms, but that's not possible because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the terms where \\(c\\) is raised to a specific power, but it doesn't specify. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem didn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a sum involving various powers of \\(c\\), which isn't a single number. That doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the expansion, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is more than just a number. So perhaps the problem is miswritten, or I'm misinterpreting it.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible terms, but that would include all the terms from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. Let me check that.\n\nSo, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we would need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nLet me calculate the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. But wait, the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so maybe I'm assuming too much. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is indeed just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that seems incorrect because the coefficient would then be a polynomial, not a single number.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that seems odd. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but without considering \\(c\\). That is, perhaps the problem is treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable and just wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the sum would still involve \\(c\\).\n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify. Let me think: when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then the product will have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{-m}\\), etc. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would give a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps it's expecting just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and not considering the second part. But that seems inconsistent because the second part is part of the product.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is a typo and meant to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120, as I calculated earlier. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the coefficients for the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and not the \\(c\\) parts, but that seems unclear.\n\nWait, let me go back to the problem statement: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, it's considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but focusing only on the \\(a^2b^2\\) part. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But that seems odd because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^4\\) or something else. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all terms, but that would include all powers of \\(c\\), making the coefficient a sum over \\(c\\) terms, which isn't a single number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), ignoring the second part, which would be 6. But that seems inconsistent because the second part is part of the product.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), is being multiplied, but since \\(c\\) is a separate variable, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient would just be 6.\n\nWait, that makes sense because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients of the variables in one polynomial are independent of the other variables. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a single number. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but considering only the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). So, that would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering only the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), is 120. Alternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, it's 6. But given that the problem includes both parts, I think the intended answer is 120.\n\nWait, let me make sure. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). Then, when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which expands to terms involving \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when I multiply, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each of these \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times (c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6})\\). So, the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be this entire expression. However, if the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, perhaps it's asking for the constant term, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too high, and I don't think that's what the problem is asking for.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. Therefore, I think the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering only the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression, we also consider the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Similarly, the other part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can also be expanded using the binomial theorem. But wait, the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I don't need to expand the entire expression. Let me think.\n\nFirst, let's consider the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^n\\) is given by \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^{k}\\). So for \\(n = 4\\), the expansion will be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\n\\]\n\nCalculating the coefficients, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{0} = 1, \\quad \\dbinom{4}{1} = 4, \\quad \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6, \\quad \\dbinom{4}{3} = 4, \\quad \\dbinom{4}{4} = 1\n\\]\n\nSo the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\). So the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, I think the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), will just multiply this coefficient by whatever the expansion of that part is. But wait, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the terms from the second part don't affect the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Let me check.\n\nLooking at \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, it will have terms involving \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, c^0, c^{-2}, c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\). So none of these terms have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) in them. That means when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think the coefficient will be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, that doesn't make sense because each term in the second part would multiply \\(a^2b^2\\), but \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term without \\(c\\). So actually, when you multiply, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that's not quite right.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply. So if I have \\(A \\times B\\), where \\(A\\) is \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(B\\) is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(B\\) is some value, say \\(C_k\\). But when you multiply \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), each term in \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\), so the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(B\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find all terms in \\(B\\) that have \\(c^0\\) because only those terms will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) to give a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times 1 (since \\(c^0 = 1\\)). So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\):\n\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies 2k = 6 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\n\nSo the term where \\(k = 3\\) is the one with \\(c^0\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3! \\times (6 - 3)!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\n\\]\n\nWait, hold on, 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720/(6*6) is 720/36 which is indeed 20. So the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. So 6 times 20 is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. So the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and to get the term without any \\(c\\) (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), we need to take the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, which happens when \\(k = 3\\). So that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first polynomial, and \\(c\\) is only in the second, the variables are separate. So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, which is exactly what I did.\n\nLet me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. So, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, correct. For the second part, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20, correct. So 6 * 20 is 120. Yep, that seems right.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\n\\]\nThe term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is given by:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2 b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Setting \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) gives \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient of this term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nSince the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the term with \\(c^0\\) from the second part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of these coefficients:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

So, I think I should focus on expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) first because that's where \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from. The other part with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) might not directly affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, but I'm not entirely sure yet. Maybe I'll just handle them separately and see how they interact.\n\nStarting with \\((a + b)^4\\), the binomial theorem tells me that the expansion is the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, right? So, I can set \\(4 - k = 2\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. That part was straightforward.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I also need to expand this using the binomial theorem. The expansion will be the sum from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nHmm, so each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, I need to think about how this interacts with the first part. The original expression is the product of the two expansions, so when I multiply them together, I'm essentially multiplying each term from the first expansion with each term from the second expansion.\n\nBut wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term comes only from the first part, right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, does that mean the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? That seems confusing because the entire expression is a product of two parts.\n\nWait a second, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first expansion, and the second expansion is multiplied by it, but \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, so when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, it will just multiply by the coefficients, but the \\(c\\) terms would remain. However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, does that mean that the coefficient remains 6 regardless of the second part? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just multiplied by the entire second expansion, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the other terms don't affect it.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. When I expand the product, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, \\(a^2b^2\\) will have coefficients multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which would create multiple terms in the final expansion, each with different powers of \\(c\\). But the question is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, perhaps the question is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, meaning it's just the term where the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out to 1, so that the coefficient is standalone.\n\nWait, that might make sense. So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which has different powers of \\(c\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then actually, the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. But that seems too broad because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, actually, the entire expression is a product, and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That is, I need to find all terms in the expansion where the exponent of \\(a\\) is 2 and the exponent of \\(b\\) is 2, and then sum their coefficients, considering all possible exponents of \\(c\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a sum involving different powers of \\(c\\), which isn't a constant. So, maybe I'm supposed to consider the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so that the term is just \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a constant, and then find that constant.\n\nThat makes more sense. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, which has different powers of \\(c\\). But if I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, then I need to find the term in the second expansion where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because \\(c^0 = 1\\), so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, in the second expansion \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me find that.\n\nFrom earlier, the general term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, I need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is when \\(m = 3\\), and that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} \\times 1 = 20\\).\n\nSo, the term in the second expansion that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from both expansions, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me check that again. So, in the first expansion, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in the second expansion, the coefficient for \\(c^0\\) is 20. Since these two terms are multiplied together when you expand the product, the resulting term is \\(6 \\times 20 \\times a^2b^2c^0 = 120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Is there a possibility that other terms from the second expansion could also contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by other terms from the first expansion? For example, if I have a term from the first expansion that is \\(a^3b\\) and a term from the second expansion that is \\(c^{-1}\\), then their product would be \\(a^3b c^{-1}\\), which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\). Similarly, if I have \\(a b^3\\) and \\(c\\), that would be \\(a b^3 c\\), which also isn't \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the term where the first expansion gives \\(a^2b^2\\) and the second expansion gives \\(c^0\\) will result in a term that is exactly \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms will have additional factors of \\(c\\) or higher powers of \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so they won't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the only contribution comes from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term and the \\(c^0\\) term.\n\nSo, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. Let me just go through it one more time to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. \n\nFirst, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). \n\nNext, expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when the exponent is zero, which occurs at \\(m = 3\\), so the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nMultiplying these two coefficients together, 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**  \n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**  \n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero (i.e., \\(c^0\\)). This occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient for this term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**  \n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from both expansions:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

The entire expression is the product of two expansions: one involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply them out, each term in the first expansion will multiply each term in the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can probably ignore the \\(c\\) terms because they won't affect the power of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Is that right? So, maybe I can treat the two parts separately.\n\nFirst, let me handle the \\((a + b)^4\\) part. Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n\\]\n\nI need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which corresponds to the term where \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, let me compute that coefficient:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part is 6.\n\nNow, the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to expand this as well. Using the binomial theorem again:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nWait, so each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when I multiply this with the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), each term in the first expansion will multiply each term in the second. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), I think I can consider the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as a single term when considering the product with \\(a^2b^2\\). Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the multiplication would just be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the sum of terms involving \\(c\\). But since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find how many times \\(a^2b^2\\) appears when multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply the two expansions, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, but since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider the sum of all terms in the second expansion multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But actually, no, because each term from the second expansion is multiplied by each term from the first. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes only from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion and the entire second expansion. But wait, that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all terms in the second expansion. But that can't be right because the second expansion includes terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which would mean the product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot 1/c^k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, because when you multiply each term in the second expansion by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it just adds the coefficient to the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nNow, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). Because when \\(c = 1\\), each term becomes just the coefficient, and the sum is the total of all coefficients. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\nSo, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Because when you have two separate expansions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expansion. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first expansion, and the second expansion doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so the coefficient should indeed be the coefficient from the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes its coefficient to the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, adding all those contributions gives 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, since the second polynomial doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial by any term from the second polynomial, which contributes its coefficient. So, the total coefficient is 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second polynomial) = 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Therefore, the final coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{384}\n\\]"

Wait, but actually, since the two parts are multiplied together, maybe I need to consider how they interact. But no, actually, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the other. So, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\).

But that can't be right because the coefficient would then include terms with \\(c\\), which isn't what we want. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again.\n\nThe problem says: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, perhaps it's just considering the part with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the rest is multiplied as a constant? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product, so each term in the product would be a combination of terms from both expansions.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), so effectively, the coefficient is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems off because the coefficients in the second expansion are not constants; they are coefficients for specific powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part times 64. Let me check that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, no, let me check that.\n\nWait, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient. The general term is \\(\\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). So, when \\(k = 2\\), the term is \\(\\binom{4}{2} a^{2} b^{2}\\), which is 6. So, the coefficient is 6. Then, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64, as I calculated before. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. So, the answer should be 384.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me think again: when you have two expressions multiplied together, like \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of the first is multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's actually the sum of all coefficients from the second part multiplied by 6. So, yes, 6 times 64 is 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then I would have to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second part and multiply them. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this approach. Suppose I have two expressions, \\(A = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(B = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, the product \\(A \\times B\\) will have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from -6 to 6 in steps of 2, I think. But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^m\\) in \\(B\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's the sum of all coefficients from \\(B\\) multiplied by the coefficient from \\(A\\), which is 6. So, that sum is indeed 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so when you multiply them, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which has terms like \\(c^6, 6c^4, 15c^2, 20, 15c^{-2}, 6c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a total of 7 terms, from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\), each with their own coefficients. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me calculate the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), which is correct. So, yes, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to write out the product, it would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^4 \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k \\times \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(k = 2\\), which is \\(\\binom{4}{2} a^2b^2\\), and this is multiplied by each term in the second sum. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I think I'm making a mistake here. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by each term in the other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and when multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term would be \\(6 \\times \\text{coefficient of } c^m\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be 6 times each coefficient of \\(c^m\\), but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's the sum of all those terms, which is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems correct. So, I think the answer is 384. But let me double-check by calculating the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I did before, setting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients is 64, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to expand both expressions and multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion, but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's the sum of all those products, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but maybe I should think of it as the coefficient being 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n$\\boxed{384}$"

    "text": " Similarly, the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which can also be expanded using the binomial theorem. \n\nWait, but the question is specifically asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they are in a separate part of the product. So, maybe I can handle each part separately and then multiply the coefficients together? Let me think.\n\nFirst, let's focus on expanding \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, which says that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^{k}\\). So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the general term is \\(\\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\). I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, right? So, that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient there is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\binom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. \n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, each term is \\(\\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, it becomes \\(\\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nBut wait, in the original problem, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). The \\(c\\) terms are multiplied by \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part and \\(c\\) is in the second, when we multiply the two expansions together, each term will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. \n\nHowever, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't involve \\(c\\), and \\(c\\) is separate, the only way for the product to have \\(a^2b^2\\) is if we take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and multiply it by any term from the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. \n\nWait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That means I need to consider all possible terms from the second expansion and multiply them by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion. But since the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that doesn't seem right because the second expansion is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so when you multiply, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which means that we're treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the product of the coefficients from each expansion. But that can't be right because the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\), so unless we're considering specific terms, the coefficient would involve a sum over all possible terms in the second expansion. \n\nWait, maybe I need to think of it differently. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion by any term from the second expansion. However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. \n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the total coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. \n\nSo, let me calculate that. The coefficient from the first part is 6, as I found earlier. Now, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in this expansion would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). \n\nTherefore, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me double-check that logic. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. In this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term from the second expansion will multiply with \\(a^2b^2\\) to give a term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, that can't be right because each multiplication would result in a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first expansion. \n\nWait, no, actually, that's not quite correct. Because in the product, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are of the form \\(\\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first expansion (6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. \n\nBut the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is indeed 64, as I calculated by setting \\(c = 1\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's correct because I feel like the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) should only be the product of the coefficients from each expansion, but since the second expansion has multiple terms, maybe I'm supposed to consider something else. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part and \\(c\\) is in another, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of those involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is simply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut that doesn't make sense because the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would result in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. \n\nWait, but that's what I thought earlier, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but the problem doesn't specify, it just says \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the answer is 384. \n\nWait, but let me check with a different approach. Let's consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that term. In this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first polynomial, and the second polynomial has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). \n\nBut the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would require that the \\(c\\) terms are raised to the power of 0, i.e., \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, actually, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion. \n\nAh, that makes more sense! I think I was confused earlier. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. \n\nSo, let's recast that. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\). \n\nNext, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do this, we can use the binomial theorem again. The general term is \\(\\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nNow, multiplying these two coefficients together: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120. \n\nWait, so earlier I thought it was 384, but that was when I considered the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. But now, I realize that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), but actually, no, that's not correct. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which means that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all possible powers of \\(c\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term by itself, the coefficient would be the sum of all the products where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but that's not quite right because each term in the product would be \\(a^2b^2\\) times a term from the second expansion, which includes \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. \n\nWait, I'm getting confused again. Let me clarify the problem statement: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" \n\nSo, in the product, each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion by each term from the second expansion. However, each such multiplication would result in a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term on its own, but in the product, it's multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only appear if the second expansion contributes a term with \\(c^0\\), i.e., 1. \n\nWait, that makes sense! So, to get a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. \n\nSo, as I calculated earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, that seems correct now. So, the final answer should be 120. \n\nLet me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives 120. \n\nYes, that seems right. I think I was confused earlier because I considered the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, but that would be the case if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), we need the term where the \\(c\\) exponent is zero, which is 20. \n\nSo, I'm confident now that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part and identifying the relevant coefficients. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**  \n   Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**  \n   The term with \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) occurs when \\(m = 3\\), giving the coefficient \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**  \n   \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So perhaps the coefficients from the second expansion just multiply the coefficients from the first expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can focus on the first part and then consider how the second part contributes.\n\nWait, actually, no.

Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when I expand the entire expression, I'm looking for all terms where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, and then for each such term, there will be a coefficient multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not right because the problem is probably asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering that the expression is a product of two separate binomial expansions. But since \\(c\\) and \\(a\\), \\(b\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. Alternatively, maybe it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean summing over all possible \\(c\\) terms.

Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would require considering all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), each multiplied by their respective coefficients. But that seems too broad, so perhaps the problem is actually only concerned with the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But then the coefficient would be a polynomial, not a single number. So maybe the problem is miswritten, or perhaps I'm misinterpreting it.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, and since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate, the coefficient would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, in the product, each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find all the terms where the product results in \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\), and then sum up their coefficients. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), perhaps it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would involve summing over all possible \\(c\\) terms, but that seems complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible terms, but since \\(c\\) and \\(a\\), \\(b\\) are separate variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply the two expansions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. That seems plausible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), ignoring the \\(c\\) terms, which would be a simpler problem. But the problem includes both \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so I think it's intended to have the product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would involve both parts. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should proceed methodically. Let's first find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is the sum from k=0 to 4 of \\(\\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). So, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs is when \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNow, the other part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's expand this using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is the sum from m=0 to 6 of \\(\\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) for m from 0 to 6.\n\nNow, when we multiply the two expansions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be the case if we're considering the product. So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, we would need to find the term where in the second expansion, the power of \\(c\\) is 0. From the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent is 0 occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient for that term is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, so now I'm confused because depending on how I interpret the problem, the answer could be either 384 or 120. Let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first. But that would give 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without mentioning \\(c\\), so maybe it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), which would make the coefficient 384. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of how the product works. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, each of which has a power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient would be 384, and the term would be \\(384a^2b^2c^k\\), where \\(k\\) varies depending on the term. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's 384.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit odd because the problem is in terms of multiple variables. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, we need to find the term in the second expansion where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, I'm getting conflicting interpretations. Let me try to clarify. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the answer would be 384 because each term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the problem statement again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's in the product of these two expressions. Now, in the product, each term is of the form \\(\\binom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\binom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as before. The coefficient for that term from the first expansion is 6. Then, each term from the second expansion is multiplied by this, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) is \\(6 \\times \\binom{6}{m}\\) for each \\(m\\). Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's the sum of all these coefficients for all \\(m\\), which would be \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\binom{6}{m}\\). But \\(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\binom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\), so the total coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we need to find the specific \\(m\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. As I found earlier, that occurs when \\(m = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\binom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's intended to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384. However, that seems a bit counterintuitive because the problem includes \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so maybe the problem expects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would be a term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make much sense because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient. Therefore, it's more plausible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but to be thorough, let me compute both possibilities.\n\nFirst, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\): that would be 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second expansion) = 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nSecond, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\): that would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nSince the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think the intended answer is 120, because otherwise, it's a bit odd to have a coefficient that's a polynomial. So, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me think again. If the problem is in the context of a single-variable expression, then it's possible that they just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), which would be 384. But given that the expression includes \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), it's more likely that they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when \\(c\\) is at its zero power, which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written in a way that \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are the only variables, and \\(c\\) is just part of the expression, but I don't think so because \\(c\\) is explicitly present.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and when you expand this, each term is a product of a term from each expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all terms where the product results in \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384, which is a constant, not a function of \\(c\\). So, perhaps that's the intended answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering only the terms where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power, which would be 120.\n\nI think I need to make a decision here. Given that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and since \\(c\\) is part of the expression, I think it's more likely that they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Therefore, I'll go with 120 as the answer.\n\nWait, but to confirm, let me calculate both:\n\n1. Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\): 6 * 64 = 384.\n2. Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\): 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nGiven that, and considering the problem statement, I think the intended answer is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n$\\boxed{120}$"
