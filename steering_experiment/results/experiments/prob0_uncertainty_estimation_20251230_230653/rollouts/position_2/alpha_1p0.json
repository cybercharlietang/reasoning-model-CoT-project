    "text": " The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^{k}\\). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLet me focus on the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). If I expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4. I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I should find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would happen when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me calculate that coefficient: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). \n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nWait, but the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think the next step is to consider how the multiplication affects the coefficient. \n\nI remember that when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply as well if the variables are independent. In this case, the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will multiply with every term in the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe we don't need to worry about the second part affecting the coefficient? \n\nWait, no, that can't be right. Because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's just 6 times the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a single number, not a sum.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), the variables are independent. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will multiply with the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). \n\nBut the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a constant with respect to \\(c\\), so when I multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it's like scaling each term by 6. But wait, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not a term that includes \\(c\\).\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and then the second part is irrelevant because it doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that seems too straightforward, and the problem wouldn't mention the second part if that's the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the entire expansion, we're looking for all terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), and then sum their coefficients. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't sound right either because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 would be 384, but I'm not sure if that's correct.\n\nWait, but actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nBut wait, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed when \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for. It just says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering the entire expression, which includes terms with \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. \n\nWait, but the question is asking for the coefficient, which is a number. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem doesn't specify. Hmm, no, the problem just says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering the entire expression, and the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem might just want the coefficient as a numerical factor, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems complicated, and I'm not sure if that's what's intended.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try a different approach. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Then, when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nSo, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will have a coefficient of 6 multiplied by each \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for \\(k\\) from 0 to 6, and each of these will be multiplied by \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think that means the coefficient regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but that seems too high. Let me check again. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But let me think about it another way. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\), so the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 * 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, maybe that's the answer.\n\nBut wait, I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes the second part, so it's probably expecting a more involved calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), when you multiply them, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since we're looking for the coefficient, not the term, maybe it's just 6, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. \n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is being multiplied by the first part, so the entire expression would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) varies. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\), with each term multiplied by the corresponding coefficient from the second part. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, so maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so it's the sum of all coefficients for terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, each multiplied by their respective coefficients from the second part. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. \n\nWait, but that seems too simplistic, especially since the problem includes both parts. Maybe I should look at it differently. Let me consider the entire product: \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I expand this, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^{k} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). \n\nSo, simplifying the exponents, the term becomes \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^{k}c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). \n\nNow, for each such term, the coefficient from the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), and the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum over all possible \\(m\\) from 0 to 6. So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\). \n\nBut the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 384. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nFirst, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, when multiplying by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nI think that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). When multiplied by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. The sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " Maybe I should start by looking at each part separately and then see how they combine.\n\nSo, the expression is the product of two parts: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since they are multiplied together, the terms from each expansion will combine. But I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first part, right? Because the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, since those terms don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Hmm, maybe that's the case.\n\nLet me try to break it down. First, let's expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^k\\). So, in this case, \\(x = a\\), \\(y = b\\), and \\(n = 4\\). So the expansion will be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). \n\nI need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let's find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), so \\(k = 2\\). So the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how this expansion works. Using the binomial theorem again, this would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nWait, but I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think that means I'm looking for the term in the second expansion that is \\(c^0\\), because \\(c^0 = 1\\), and that won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.\n\nSo, in the second expansion, I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That is, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So the term where \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} \\times 1 = 20\\). So the coefficient here is 20.\n\nWait, so that means the term in the second expansion that is a constant (doesn't involve \\(c\\)) is 20. So when I multiply the two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, which has a coefficient of 6, will be multiplied by this constant term 20. So the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nLet me just check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying those together gives 120. Hmm, that seems right.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't overlook anything. When I multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is only going to combine with the constant term in the second part to give a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant. So, yes, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire product as the product of two separate expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each part where the exponents match in a way that the product term ends up as \\(a^2b^2\\). But since the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and the constant term from the second expansion. So, that's consistent with what I found earlier.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: since the two parts are independent, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. I think that's correct.\n\nSo, after going through this step by step, I'm pretty confident that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by multiplying the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) (which is 6) by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) (which is 20). Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

    "text": " The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^{k}\\). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLet me focus on the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). If I expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I need the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. That means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. But wait, the problem isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider both expansions and see how they interact.\n\nLet me denote the first part as \\(A = (a + b)^4\\) and the second part as \\(B = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression is \\(A \\times B\\). Since multiplication distributes over addition, each term in \\(A\\) will multiply each term in \\(B\\). But I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term from \\(A\\). So, when I multiply \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), the terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\) will be \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in \\(B\\). But since \\(B\\) only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't be affected by \\(B\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression should just be the same as the coefficient in \\(A\\), right? Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by any term from \\(B\\), you'll get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(6a^2b^2 \\times c^{-k}\\), but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would only be present if there's a term in \\(B\\) that is 1, but \\(B\\) doesn't have a constant term unless \\(k = 0\\). Wait, actually, no. Because \\(B\\) is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, it will have terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\), but none of these terms will affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term except for the constant term, if any.\n\nWait, but does \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) have a constant term? Let me think. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent on \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). For this to be a constant term, \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when I multiply \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from \\(A\\) will multiply the constant term 20 from \\(B\\), giving \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2 = 120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, is that correct?\n\nHold on, let me double-check. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from \\(A\\), and any terms from \\(B\\) that are constants (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the only contribution to \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\(A\\) and the constant term in \\(B\\). So, yes, that should be correct. The coefficient is 6 (from \\(A\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(B\\)), giving 120.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything else. Could there be other terms in \\(B\\) that somehow combine with terms in \\(A\\) to produce \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, but \\(A\\) only has terms with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), while \\(B\\) only has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, you get terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{m}\\) or \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{-m}\\), but the \\(c\\) terms don't interact with \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from \\(A\\) times the coefficient from the constant term in \\(B\\). So, yes, 6 times 20 is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since the variables are separate, their coefficients multiply. So, that's another way to see it.\n\nJust to recap, the steps are:\n\n1. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6.\n\n2. Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20.\n\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you multiply polynomials, terms can combine in non-obvious ways. But in this case, since \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are in separate variables, their multiplication doesn't affect the exponents of each other's variables. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\(A\\) remains \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by any term in \\(B\\), but only when multiplied by the constant term in \\(B\\) does it result in a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms from \\(B\\) would introduce \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), making the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), which aren't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the constant term in \\(B\\) contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nTherefore, I think my reasoning is correct.

    "text": " Maybe I should start by expanding each part separately and then see how they combine.\n\nSo, let's break it down. The expression has two parts: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so how does that affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term? Maybe the two parts are multiplied together, so the coefficients from each part will multiply as well. Let me think.\n\nFirst, let's handle \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, which states that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^{k}\\), I can expand this. Here, \\(x = a\\), \\(y = b\\), and \\(n = 4\\). So, the expansion will be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\n\\]\n\nCalculating the coefficients:\n\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} = 1\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} = 1\\)\n\nSo, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\na^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. Let me write that out:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\n\\]\n\nSimplifying each term:\n\nEach term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times c^{-k}\\) because \\(\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = c^{-k}\\). So, combining the exponents:\n\n\\[\nc^{6 - k - k} = c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nNow, since the problem is about \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that right? Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply term by term. So, if I have \\( (6a^2b^2) \\times \\left( \\text{something with } c \\right) \\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to consider the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part because \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) is still \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me calculate that.\n\nFrom the expansion earlier, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so:\n\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies 2k = 6 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the term where \\(k = 3\\) is the one with \\(c^0\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3! \\times (6 - 3)!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\n\\]\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Wait, 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720 divided by (6 * 6) is 720 / 36, which is indeed 20. So, the coefficient is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, when you multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only consider the term where the second part contributes a \\(c^0\\), which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the entire expression is the product of the two expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. But since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but actually, the problem might just be considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the entire expression is a product, so when you multiply, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term on its own, and when multiplied by \\(c\\) terms, it becomes \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120, as the other terms would involve \\(c\\) and thus wouldn't contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) alone.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the problem is treating \\(c\\) as an independent variable, and it's looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing 6 times each coefficient.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\). Let me check that. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, if I set \\(c = 1\\), the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too high, and I don't think that's what the problem is asking. I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that's not standard. Usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term in a product, you're looking for the coefficient when considering all variables. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem didn't specify any \\(c\\) terms, so maybe it's just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems conflicting with my earlier thought.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try another approach. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the sum of all coefficients from the second part multiplied by 6. Because each term in the second part is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(6 \\times\\) (coefficient from second part) times \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second part is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering that the expression is a product, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and any term in the second part, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) in the second part. So, that would be 6 * 20 = 120, as I thought earlier.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because if you have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and you multiply it by each term in the second part, which includes \\(c^k\\), then the only way to have a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\) (without any \\(c\\)) is to multiply by the \\(c^0\\) term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nLet me confirm this. Suppose I have two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and one in \\(c\\). When I multiply them, the variables are independent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, but only if we're considering terms where the variables don't interact. Wait, no, actually, no. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term with \\(c^k\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is a different term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, because only that term doesn't introduce any \\(c\\) terms. So, yes, that would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I have \\( (a + b)^4 = P(a, b) \\) and \\( \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = Q(c) \\). Then, the product is \\( P(a, b) \\times Q(c) \\). So, any term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by any term in \\(Q(c)\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). Therefore, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(Q(c)\\). But if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), that is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(Q(c)\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, without considering \\(c\\), that is, treating \\(c\\) as an independent variable, then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems unlikely because usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term in a product, you're considering all variables. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean 384. But that contradicts my earlier reasoning.\n\nWait, perhaps I should clarify. Let me re-express the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, the variables involved are \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), but not in \\(c\\). Therefore, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the constant term in the \\(c\\) part. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\), and the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. If you were to consider other terms, like \\(a^2b^2c^1\\), that would be a different term, and the problem is specifically asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), so it's only the constant term in \\(c\\) that contributes to that.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\), as I had before. So, for \\(c^0\\), \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Then, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), which is correct. So, that part is right.\n\nAnd in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), which is also correct.\n\nSo, multiplying 6 * 20 gives 120, which should be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression.\n\nI think that's the answer. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each expansion:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " The binomial theorem states that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nAlright, so for the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), I can expand it as \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}ab^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}b^4\\). Let me compute those coefficients. \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}\\) is 1, \\(\\dbinom{4}{1}\\) is 4, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, \\(\\dbinom{4}{3}\\) is 4, and \\(\\dbinom{4}{4}\\) is 1. So, the expansion is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nNow, I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in this expansion is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, maybe I need to consider how this multiplication works.\n\nLet me think. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, no, that might not be right. Because when you multiply, the variables also multiply. So, if I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't care about the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the entire second expression, which includes terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms might not affect it. Hmm, that doesn't make sense because the variables are different. So, actually, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression, but since the variables are separate, the \\(c\\) terms won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms.\n\nWait, so does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expression, each term will contribute to different parts of the product, but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) specifically will be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second expression, since each term in the second expression is a constant times some power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it just adds a coefficient without changing the \\(a^2b^2\\) part.\n\nWait, but that might not be accurate because the second expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has terms with different powers of \\(c\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to consider all terms in the second expression, because each term will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing to the overall coefficient.\n\nWait, but that seems confusing. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, if I have \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by, say, \\(c^6\\), that gives \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), and if I have \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^5 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c}\\), which is \\(c^4\\), that gives \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), and so on. So, each term in the second expression, when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), just adds another term to the product, each with the same \\(a^2b^2\\) part but different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all the coefficients in the second expression multiplied by 6.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the second expression isn't a constant; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expression, each term will have a different power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second expression multiplied by 6.\n\nBut actually, no, because in the product, each term is a combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, if I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because each term in the second expression, when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), will contribute a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), and the coefficient for each of these terms is 6 times the coefficient from the second expression.\n\nTherefore, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to compute 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Now, how do I find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)?\n\nI remember that the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because the second expression is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and when I set \\(c = 1\\), I get the sum of the coefficients, which is 64. So, when I multiply each term in the first expansion by each term in the second, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the coefficient from the first expansion (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion (which is 64). So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Let me think again. Because in the product, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which has a coefficient. So, the total contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. So yes, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this differently. Let's consider that \\((a + b)^4\\) is being multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all separate variables, the terms in the product will be combinations of powers of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion and any term in the second expansion, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check this again because sometimes when dealing with multiple variables, you have to consider if any cross terms affect the coefficient, but in this case, since the variables are separate, I think this approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as the product of two independent polynomials, so the coefficients multiply accordingly. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum over all possible \\(k\\), which is the same as multiplying by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nTherefore, I think my initial approach is correct, and the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me compute \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and see if the sum of coefficients is indeed 64. Let's expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. It would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\cdot (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, the terms are:\n\n- \\(k=0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1 \\cdot c^6\\)\n- \\(k=1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^4 = 6c^4\\)\n- \\(k=2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^2 = 15c^2\\)\n- \\(k=3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\\)\n- \\(k=4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(k=5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(k=6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the coefficients are 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1. Adding these up: 1 + 6 = 7, 7 +15=22, 22+20=42, 42+15=57, 57+6=63, 63+1=64. So yes, the sum of coefficients is indeed 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have multiple variables, the exponents can interfere, but in this case, since the variables are different, I think this approach works.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all separate, the coefficients multiply independently. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the final answer should be 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, since each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " The binomial theorem says that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^{k}\\). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLet me start by looking at the first part of the expression: \\((a + b)^4\\). If I expand this using the binomial theorem, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4. So, the possible terms are:\n\n- When \\(k = 0\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} a^4 b^0 = 1 \\cdot a^4\\)\n- When \\(k = 1\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} a^3 b^1 = 4 \\cdot a^3 b\\)\n- When \\(k = 2\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2 b^2 = 6 \\cdot a^2 b^2\\)\n- When \\(k = 3\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} a^1 b^3 = 4 \\cdot a b^3\\)\n- When \\(k = 4\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} a^0 b^4 = 1 \\cdot b^4\\)\n\nSo, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). That part I think I understand.\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply the two expansions together, I'll be combining terms from both expansions. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms will only combine if the variables match. However, in this case, since one part has \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and the other has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the variables don't overlap. That means that each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, but the variables won't combine in a way that affects the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Hmm, so maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second part? Wait, that doesn't sound right.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that means any term that includes \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) would make the term have variables \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something, which is different from \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to get a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part by a term from the second part that is just 1, right? Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by 1, you get \\(a^2b^2\\), which is what we're looking for. If you multiply it by \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), you'll have extra variables.\n\nWait, but the second expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand that, the terms will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\), where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. So, the term where \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) would be when \\(6 = 2m\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20 \\cdot 1 = 20\\). So, the constant term in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, the only term from the second expansion that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is 20. So, when I multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion, which is \\(6a^2b^2\\), by the constant term 20 from the second expansion, I get \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2 = 120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(6a^2b^2\\). The second part: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives a constant term when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, multiplying these together, 6 * 20 = 120. So, yeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of the entire product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanding this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(6a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and any term in the second part that is a constant (i.e., doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\)) will result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by that constant. Since the only constant term in the second expansion is 20, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I'm not missing anything, let me think again. Suppose I didn't consider the second expansion correctly. Let's see, the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me compute that expansion to see if there are any other terms that could result in a constant when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but no, because any term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) would introduce those variables into the term, making it something like \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the constant term from the second expansion will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the final product.\n\nSo, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two parts together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) becomes 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me just verify that the constant term in the second expansion is indeed 20. So, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when does the exponent of \\(c\\) equal zero? When \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\\). Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but another thought: Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), does that mean that the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients from each part? Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are only in the second part, so when you multiply, the variables don't interfere. So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by the constant term from the second part. So, that would indeed be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion is 6.\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient for this term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I don't need to multiply the entire expansions. Instead, I can focus on the terms that will contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied together.\n\nLet me think: when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. However, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the variables involved in each part are independent. That means the coefficients for the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by the coefficients for the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\).\n\nBut wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, I might not need to consider the \\(c\\) terms at all. Because no matter what power of \\(c\\) is multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, it will still be part of the overall expression, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the same across all those terms. Hmm, that might not be correct because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because \\(c\\) and \\(a, b\\) are separate variables.\n\nWait, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression will be multiplied by every term in the second expression. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But wait, no, that's not right either because each term in the second part has its own coefficient, so when you multiply, each term in the second part will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me clarify: the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are in one part, and the \\(c\\) terms are in another. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, each contributing their own coefficient. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because the coefficients in the second expansion aren't all being added together; they're being multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would give a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), and the coefficients would add up across all those terms.\n\nWait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Let me check that.\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Now, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. It's possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, each term in the first expansion (which has \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion (which has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\)). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each contributing their own coefficient. Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) for various \\(k\\) would be 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without specifying the power of \\(c\\), it might mean that we need to consider all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, that seems like the correct approach. Let me verify with a simpler example. Suppose we have \\((a + b)^1 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\). Then, the expansion would be \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Indeed, expanding, we get \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, which matches.\n\nSimilarly, if we take \\((a + b)^2 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is \\((1 + 1)^2 = 4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the product would be 1 * 4 = 4. Expanding, the terms involving \\(a^2\\) would be \\(a^2c^2 + a^2/c^2\\), each with coefficient 1, so total coefficient is 2, but wait, that's different. Hmm, maybe my earlier reasoning is flawed.\n\nWait, no, in this case, the sum of coefficients in the second part is 4, but when we multiply by \\(a^2\\), we get \\(a^2 \\times (c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2)\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 4, but in reality, the expansion would have \\(a^2c^2 + 2a^2 + a^2/c^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) is indeed 4. So, my initial approach seems correct.\n\nTherefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The sum of coefficients in the second part is indeed 64 because when \\(c = 1\\), \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times each term in that expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion, but since the problem is asking for the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), we sum all those contributions, which is 6 times 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but another thought: maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. It says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". If the variables \\(c\\) are involved, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion, but since the problem doesn't specify a particular power of \\(c\\), it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering \\(a^2b^2\\) as a term independent of \\(c\\), but that doesn't make sense because \\(c\\) and \\(a, b\\) are separate variables. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can have any power of \\(c\\) multiplied by it, but the coefficient would still be 6 times the coefficient of the corresponding \\(c\\) term. However, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying the power of \\(c\\), so perhaps it's just 6 times the entire expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the expansion includes different powers of \\(c\\).\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^k b^m c^n\\) or \\(a^k b^m c^{-n}\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each coefficient in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with a smaller exponent to see if this holds. Suppose we have \\((a + b)^1 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Expanding, we get \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The terms with \\(a\\) are \\(ac\\) and \\(a/c\\), each with coefficient 1, so the total coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, which matches 1 * 2.\n\nSimilarly, in \\((a + b)^2 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 4. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the product is 1 * 4 = 4. Expanding, we get \\(a^2c^2 + 2a^2 + a^2/c^2 + 2abc + 2ab/c + 2ab/c^2 + b^2c^2 + 2b^2 + b^2/c^2\\). The terms with \\(a^2\\) are \\(a^2c^2\\), \\(2a^2\\), and \\(a^2/c^2\\), so the coefficients are 1, 2, and 1, adding up to 4, which matches 1 * 4.\n\nTherefore, my reasoning seems correct. So, applying it to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (the sum of coefficients in the second part), giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the sum of coefficients in the second part. The sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). That's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when you have expressions with negative exponents, the sum of coefficients isn't just setting the variable to 1. But in this case, since we're dealing with the entire expression, substituting \\(c = 1\\) does give the sum of all coefficients, both positive and negative exponents. So, yes, 64 is correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is calculated by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in 64. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{384}\n\\]"

    "text": " The binomial theorem says that each term in the expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{n}{k}a^{n - k}b^k\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to \\(n\\). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLet me start by looking at the first part of the expression, which is \\((a + b)^4\\). If I expand this using the binomial theorem, each term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I'm specifically looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so that's \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to find the value of \\(k\\) such that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, when \\(k = 2\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^{2}b^{2}\\).\n\nCalculating the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), I remember that this is equal to \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. So far, so good.\n\nNow, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider how this multiplication affects the terms. Wait, but actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the second part, when I multiply the two expressions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't affect the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). That is, the variables are separate, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe we don't need to consider the other terms.\n\nWait, but actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), then when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will be multiplied by the corresponding term in \\((a + b)^4\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that might not be correct because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a term with some power of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), the product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). But since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider the terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because only then will the term be \\(a^2b^2\\) times 1 (i.e., \\(c^0\\)).\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to do that.\n\nAgain, using the binomial theorem for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term will be \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the exponent to be zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is when \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and when we multiply it by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), only the term where \\(c^0\\) will contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product, because any other term would have a \\(c\\) exponent, making the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or similar, which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the \\(c^0\\) term, which has a coefficient of 20, will multiply with the 6 to give the total coefficient of 120. That makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the entire product being a combination of terms, and since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part and \\(c\\) is in the other, the coefficients multiply when the exponents of the variables don't interfere. So, yeah, I think 120 is the correct coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in calculating the binomial coefficients. Let me recalculate \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). \n\nFor \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), it's \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). That's correct.\n\nFor \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), it's \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). That's also correct.\n\nSo, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. I think I'm confident that 120 is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   Each term in the expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\). We need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\).\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   Each term in the expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which corresponds to solving \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) giving \\(k = 3\\).\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients found in the two expansions.\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, that part is clear. The coefficient is 6.\n\nNow, the expression also has another part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm not sure if this affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are different variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms when looking for \\(a^2b^2\\). Or do I?\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. The entire expression is the product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply them together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to make sure that when I multiply the terms, the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't get any additional terms from the \\(c\\) part. So, perhaps I only need the constant term from the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion because if I take any term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), then the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), which isn't what I want. I think I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, so that the coefficient just contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.\n\nSo, let me try to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do this, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nI want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero because that's the constant term. So, I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, when I multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by the constant term 20 from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me double-check that.

So, when I multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider if there's any other way the term \\(a^2b^2\\) could be formed. But since the other part is only involving \\(c\\), I don't think so. The variables are separate, so the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) appears is by taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and the constant term from the second part.

    "text": " Maybe I should start by expanding each part separately and then see how they combine.\n\nSo, let's consider the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this should expand to the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\).

So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion will be the sum from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}c^{-m}\\) which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, but this second part is in terms of \\(c\\), so how does that relate to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)? Oh, right, because the entire expression is the product of the two expansions, so when you multiply them together, you'll be combining terms from both expansions. So, to get the term \\(a^2b^2\\), we only need to consider the coefficients from each expansion and multiply them together, since the variables are separate.\n\nWait, but actually, let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), contributes a term that's a power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I might not need to consider the \\(c\\) terms at all. Because when you multiply the two expansions together, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and multiply it by any term from the second expansion. But since the second expansion has only \\(c\\) terms, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that doesn't seem right because the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\), so when you multiply, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion?\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and if we consider the entire expansion, the sum of its coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, if I were to take the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and multiply it by 64, that would give me 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not the coefficient when considering all powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, maybe I'm supposed to treat the entire expression as a product of two separate expansions and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term will have a coefficient, and since we're just interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), we sum all those coefficients from the second part.\n\nSo, the coefficient from the first part is 6, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\( (1 + 1/1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure if that's the correct approach because I might be misapplying the concept.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that when multiplying the two expansions, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. So, that would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term gets multiplied by every term in the second expansion, each contributing their own coefficient. So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I'm not sure if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), or if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\). The problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so I think it's the former, meaning that we consider all possible powers of \\(c\\), and just sum up the coefficients from each term that has \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me think of a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1)^1\\). The expansion would be \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, that's a bad example. Let me try another one.\n\nSuppose I have \\((a + b)^1 (c + 1)^1\\). The expansion is \\((a + b)(c + 1) = ac + a + bc + b\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 2 (from \\(c + 1\\)). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) is 2. But in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no such term.\n\nWait, but in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check by actually expanding a small part. Let's consider \\((a + b)^4\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6a^2b^2. Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to terms like c^6, 6c^4, 15c^2, 20, 15c^{-2}, 6c^{-4}, c^{-6}. So, each of these terms is multiplied by 6a^2b^2, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6, \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 6*6=36, \\(a^2b^2c^2\\) is 6*15=90, \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6*20=120, and so on. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, I think I made a mistake earlier. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the same as \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. Therefore, I should find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion, which is 6, and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) because when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), \\(m = 3\\). So, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, I think I was wrong before when I considered the sum of all coefficients. Instead, I should find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion because that's the only term that would give me \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) term. So, the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20, and multiply them together to get 120.\n\nLet me confirm this. The second expansion, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), has terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). To get \\(c^0\\), we need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by taking the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), and multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Maybe I should start by expanding each part separately and then see how they combine.\n\nLet me recall the binomial theorem. It states that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^{k}\\). So, for the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\). I'm looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient there would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. That seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm not directly asked about the coefficient in this part, but since the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficients from both parts will multiply together. However, I'm only concerned with the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part. Wait, but actually, the variables in the two parts are different: one involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the other involves \\(c\\). So, when I multiply them, the terms would be products of terms from each expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), maybe I don't need to consider the second part at all? That seems confusing.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The entire expression is the product of two separate expressions, so when I expand both and multiply, each term in the first expansion will multiply each term in the second expansion. But since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), I need to find all the terms in the second expansion that have \\(c^0\\), because \\(c^0 = 1\\), and that way, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it will just contribute a coefficient without introducing any \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, I need the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because that's the only term that won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term when multiplied.\n\nSo, let me work on finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nI need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero for the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying them together, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the first part gives me 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives me 20 for the constant term, which when multiplied together, gives 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about it another way. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} \\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k} b^{k} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, I want the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), which requires \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as I found earlier. So, for \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(k = 2\\). Then, for the \\(c\\) part, I want the exponent to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\dbinom{6}{3} a^2b^2 c^0 = 6 \\times 20 a^2b^2 = 120 a^2b^2\\). So, yes, the coefficient is 120. That seems consistent.\n\nI think that's the correct approach. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\n\\]\nWe are interested in the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), which occurs when \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient for this term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero). Setting \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient for this term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " The binomial theorem states that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^{k}\\). So maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLet me start by looking at the first part of the expression, which is \\((a + b)^4\\). If I expand this using the binomial theorem, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. So, the coefficients will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{1}\\), up to \\(\\dbinom{4}{4}\\), which are 1, 4, 6, 4, 1 respectively. So, the expansion would be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nAlright, so in this expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. That seems straightforward. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the next part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I also need to expand this part, right? But wait, I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part. So, maybe I don't need to worry about the entire expansion of the second part? Or do I?\n\nWait, no, because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider how it interacts with the second part. But actually, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply it by any term in the second expansion, it'll just be \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), or is it?\n\nWait, no, hold on. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, that means we need to find all terms in the product where the power of \\(a\\) is 2 and the power of \\(b\\) is 2, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient will be the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by some coefficient, and we need to add all those up.\n\nWait, but is that correct? Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply term by term. So, if I have \\( (a + b)^4 = \\text{something} \\) and \\( \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\text{something else} \\), then each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial will be multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, but the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part would be when \\(c = 1\\), because substituting \\(c = 1\\) into the polynomial gives the sum of the coefficients. So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (the sum of coefficients from the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me verify this because sometimes when you have variables, the coefficients might not just multiply directly. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, which is 6a^2b^2, and when you multiply this by the entire second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you get 6a^2b^2 multiplied by each term in the second expansion.\n\nSo, for example, 6a^2b^2 * c^6, 6a^2b^2 * 6c^4, and so on. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because in the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have some power of \\(c\\), but if we're just looking for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then yes, it's 384.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Let me try another way. Let's consider the entire expression as the product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the terms are independent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by the corresponding term in the first part.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of two independent polynomials, so the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients. So, 6 from the first part and 64 from the second part, giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm correct. Let me expand both parts and see. First, \\((a + b)^4\\) as we did before is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion would be:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The coefficients here are \\(\\dbinom{6}{0} = 1\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{1} = 6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{2} = 15\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), and so on, up to \\(\\dbinom{6}{6} = 1\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\), as I thought before.\n\nTherefore, when I multiply the two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which has coefficients summing to 64. So, the total coefficient contributed to \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 * 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but is that correct? Let me think again. If I have \\(6a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second polynomial, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each of these, I get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any specific \\(k\\). So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by 6. So, 6 times 64 is indeed 384.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm confusing the terms. Let me clarify: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the terms in each polynomial that multiply to give that term. But in this case, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that for each term in the second polynomial, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{k}\\), but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), we need to sum all those contributions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient, so when you sum all those contributions, you get the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nSo, yes, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute it another way. Let's think about the entire expansion:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\left(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\right) \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\right)\n\\]\n\nNow, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can see that it's only present in the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial. When I multiply this by each term in the second polynomial, each of those products will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all the coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by 6.\n\nSo, the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\), as before. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). In that case, we would need to find the coefficient where the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, that would be the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero in the second polynomial.\n\nLooking at the second polynomial, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, so now I'm confused. Is the problem asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), or specifically \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)? Because the wording says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\", which might imply that it's considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and looking for the coefficient where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in that case, it's 384. Alternatively, if it's asking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120.\n\nWait, maybe I need to clarify the problem statement. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut now I'm second-guessing because sometimes when you have multiple variables, the coefficient is considered with all variables. So, perhaps the problem is expecting 120, if it's looking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). But the way it's phrased, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying \\(c\\), so it's ambiguous.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the expression is \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the variables involved are \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have some power of \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). So, in that case, it's 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had said \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)\", then it would be 120. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in one variable is the product of the coefficient of that term in the first polynomial and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, for example, if I have \\((P(a,b))(Q(c))\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a,b)\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\).\n\nYes, that makes sense because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total contribution to \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\) times the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a,b)\\).\n\nSo, in this case, the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\) is 64, as we saw earlier, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a,b)\\) is 6, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute it another way. Let me consider that when you multiply the two polynomials, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), etc., up to \\(c^{-6}\\). So, each of these will create a term like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then all these terms contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so we need to add up all the coefficients from the second polynomial and multiply by 6.\n\nSo, the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 * 20 = 120, because the term with \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial has a coefficient of 20.\n\nBut since the problem is just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying \\(c\\), I think it's 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes problems might consider only the terms where all variables are present, but in this case, I think the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of coefficients from the second part, leading to 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be interpreted as looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but I'm not sure. Let me check that.\n\nIf I compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. But if I compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, it's 384.\n\nWait, but let me think about how the problem is written. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, the expression is in terms of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, when they ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), they might mean the coefficient when considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, it's 384.\n\nBut I'm still a bit uncertain because sometimes, when you have multiple variables, people might interpret the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as the coefficient when all other variables are set to a specific value, like 1, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), so the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nSo, I think that's the answer. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me try to compute it by expanding both parts and looking at the coefficients.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives us:\n\n\\[\na^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives us:\n\n\\[\nc^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\n\\]\n\nNow, when we multiply these two, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in:\n\n\\[\n6a^2b^2c^6 + 36a^2b^2c^4 + 90a^2b^2c^2 + 120a^2b^2 + 90a^2b^2c^{-2} + 36a^2b^2c^{-4} + 6a^2b^2c^{-6}\n\\]\n\nSo, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all the coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by 6, because each term in the second polynomial contributes a coefficient to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, the coefficients from the second polynomial are 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1. Summing these gives 1 + 6 = 7, 7 + 15 = 22, 22 + 20 = 42, 42 + 15 = 57, 57 + 6 = 63, 63 + 1 = 64. So, the sum is 64, as before.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in the expansion I just did, each term has a different power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same across all those terms, right? So, when you look at the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in each of those terms, each multiplied by a different power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient for each of those terms is 6 times the coefficient from the second polynomial.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one variable is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient is just the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem to expand each part separately and then consider their product.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, we get:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion is 6.\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives:\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results**:\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, we multiply 6 by 64:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^{k}\\). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLet me write down the expansion for \\((a + b)^4\\). According to the binomial theorem, it should be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\n\\]\n\nCalculating the coefficients:\n\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} = 1\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} = 1\\)\n\nSo, the expansion becomes:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nOkay, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. But wait, the original problem isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I need to consider both parts.\n\nI think the key here is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will depend on the product of the coefficients from each part, but only when the exponents of the variables match. Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are only in the second part. So, actually, the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent of each other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Is that right?\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem correct. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. But since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what happens with \\(c\\). So, when we multiply the two expressions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is being multiplied by each term in the second expression, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will accumulate all the coefficients from the second expression.\n\nSo, to clarify, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, I need to calculate two things:\n\n1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found to be 6.\n2. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but how do I find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? I remember that the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I should get the sum of all coefficients.\n\nLet me try that:\n\n\\[\n\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\nSo, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Is it correct to multiply the coefficients like that? Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients of the terms multiply, but only when the variables are the same. But in this case, the second polynomial doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so each term in the first polynomial is being scaled by the entire second polynomial. So, when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's indeed multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. That makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as distributing the multiplication. So, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and when multiplied by any term from the second part, it will still be \\(a^2b^2\\) times something. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think it's correct to multiply the coefficient from the first part by the sum of coefficients from the second part.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient, and not the variables, the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term's coefficient. So, it's as if we're scaling the coefficient by the entire second expression's coefficients sum.\n\nYes, I think that's right. So, the coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm not missing something. Let me try to write out the product more explicitly. So, the product is:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4) \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^5 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c} + 15c^4 \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^2 + 20c^3 \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^3 + 15c^2 \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^4 + 6c \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^5 + \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\right)\n\\]\n\nWait, that's a bit messy, but maybe I can compute the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem as well. Let me do that.\n\nSo, expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), using the binomial theorem:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, the terms are:\n\n- When \\(k=0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1 \\times c^6 = c^6\\)\n- \\(k=1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^{4} = 6c^4\\)\n- \\(k=2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^{2} = 15c^2\\)\n- \\(k=3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\)\n- \\(k=4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(k=5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(k=6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\nc^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\n\\]\n\nNow, if I want the sum of all coefficients, that's when \\(c = 1\\), as I thought earlier. Plugging \\(c = 1\\) into this expression:\n\n\\[\n1^6 + 6 \\times 1^4 + 15 \\times 1^2 + 20 + 15 \\times 1^{-2} + 6 \\times 1^{-4} + 1 \\times 1^{-6} = 1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64\n\\]\n\nWhich confirms that the sum of the coefficients is indeed 64.\n\nSo, going back, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and when multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 64, we get \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure that this is the correct approach. Because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is being multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient that is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. So, yes, that would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the product as a single polynomial, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, but since the second polynomial's terms don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) just gets scaled by the entire second polynomial's sum of coefficients.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply only when the variables match. But in this case, the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all separate, so when you multiply, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial, but the variables remain separate. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which are all powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be accompanied by each possible power of \\(c\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think we just need to sum up all the contributions to \\(a^2b^2\\) from each multiplication.\n\nWait, but in reality, each multiplication of \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term in the second polynomial will result in a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), where \\(k\\) is the exponent from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, does that mean we're considering all possible \\(c\\) terms? Or are we supposed to ignore the \\(c\\) terms?\n\nWait, no, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, actually, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second polynomial. Because if we multiply by any \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), we'll end up with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or similar, which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I was wrong earlier. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term we're interested in. If you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\) where \\(k \\neq 0\\), you get a term with \\(c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nHmm, that's a different approach. So, let me recast my earlier reasoning. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The term \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20, as calculated earlier when \\(k=3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, so now I'm getting a different answer. Which one is correct?\n\nLet me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when you multiply out, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, to get a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\), you need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) (which comes from the first polynomial) by the term in the second polynomial that has \\(c^0\\), because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) power, making the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part (which is 20). So, 6 times 20 is 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but that was under the assumption that we're summing all coefficients in the second polynomial. But that approach would be correct if we were looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), but the problem doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so perhaps it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\)'s exponent. But in reality, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only appear if we multiply by \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the term would have a \\(c\\) component.\n\nWait, but the problem is stated as: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would appear in the product with every possible power of \\(c\\), but each time multiplied by the corresponding coefficient from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum over all coefficients from the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives a term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). Hmm, this is a bit confusing.\n\nWait, but in reality, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only exist in the product if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the term in the second polynomial that has \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the term would have a \\(c\\) component. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 times 20, which is 120. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 384.\n\nWait, but in algebra, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term, like \\(a^2b^2\\), in a product of polynomials, it's usually considering the term with exactly those variables and exponents, regardless of other variables. So, in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but I'm getting conflicting conclusions here. Let me try to clarify.\n\nIf the problem had been asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then it would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second polynomial. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any \\(c\\) terms, I think it's ambiguous. But in standard algebra, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term that doesn't involve another variable, you're only considering the cases where the other variables' exponents are zero. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 times 20, equaling 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had been asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 384. But since the problem is just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's the former case, where we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\)'s exponent, which would require the \\(c\\) exponent to be zero. Therefore, the correct coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check this again. Let's consider the entire expansion. The product is:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4) \\times (c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6})\n\\]\n\nWhen you multiply these out, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, for example, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in:\n\n- \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\)\n- \\(6 \\times 6a^2b^2c^4 = 36a^2b^2c^4\\)\n- \\(6 \\times 15a^2b^2c^2 = 90a^2b^2c^2\\)\n- \\(6 \\times 20a^2b^2 = 120a^2b^2\\)\n- \\(6 \\times 15a^2b^2c^{-2} = 90a^2b^2c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(6 \\times 6a^2b^2c^{-4} = 36a^2b^2c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(6 \\times 1a^2b^2c^{-6} = 6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) appears only when multiplied by the constant term (20) in the second polynomial, resulting in \\(120a^2b^2\\). All other terms have \\(c\\) exponents, so they are not just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120.\n\nTherefore, my initial thought that it was 384 was incorrect because I was considering the sum of all coefficients, which would be the case if we were looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), we only consider the multiplication by the constant term in the second polynomial, which gives us 120.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me think about another example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)(c + d)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) in this product would be the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first part times the sum of coefficients in the second part, right? Because when you multiply \\(a\\) by each term in the second polynomial, you get \\(ac\\), \\(ad\\), etc., but if you're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\), you have to consider that \\(a\\) times the constant term in the second polynomial (if any) would give you a term with just \\(a\\). But in this case, the second polynomial is \\(c + d\\), which has no constant term, so the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be zero. Wait, no, that's not correct because if you have \\((a + b)(c + d)\\), the product is \\(ac + ad + bc + bd\\). There is no term with just \\(a\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) is indeed zero.\n\nBut in our original problem, the second polynomial does have a constant term, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but in my earlier example, if the second polynomial had a constant term, say \\((a + b)(1 + c)\\), then the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be 1 times 1, which is 1, because \\(a \\times 1 = a\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1. Similarly, in our problem, since the second polynomial has a constant term of 20, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check using another approach. Let's consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial. Because when you multiply these two terms together, you get \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that would be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to compute the entire product and look for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), it would only come from the multiplication of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and the constant term from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nI think I've convinced myself that the correct answer is 120. My initial confusion was thinking that the sum of all coefficients would contribute, but actually, only the constant term from the second polynomial contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6.\n2. Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20.\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by multiplying the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\n3. Multiply the coefficients:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Maybe I should apply that here. \n\nSo, let's consider the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this would expand to the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\). I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That would correspond to the term where \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), right? So, substituting \\(k = 2\\), the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the problem isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire expression. Since the two parts are multiplied together, the overall expansion would involve multiplying each term from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) by each term from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nHowever, the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) because they won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts. So, perhaps I can treat the two parts separately and then multiply the coefficients? \n\nLet me think. If I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\) which has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), and then I multiply it by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which has its own terms. But since the question is only about \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that doesn't sound right because each term in the expansion would be multiplied by each term from the other expansion. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of those involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. It says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the entire expression. So, perhaps it's considering the entire expression as a single polynomial in variables \\(a, b, c, 1/c\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\) from the other expansion. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all possible terms, regardless of \\(c\\). But I'm not sure. Maybe I need to clarify. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems more complicated. \n\nWait, maybe I should think of it as a product of two independent expansions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6a^2b^2, and then it's multiplied by each term from the second expansion \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. \n\nHmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the problem is actually only considering the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense either because the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) are not being summed; they're part of the expansion. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me try to approach it differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^{k} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need to find all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears. That would require \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, from the first part, we have \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, for each such term, it's multiplied by terms from the second expansion. But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would give a coefficient that's a function of \\(c\\). But that seems odd because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the part that doesn't involve \\(c\\), but that doesn't seem right. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply 6a^2b^2 by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term would be 6a^2b^2 multiplied by a term involving \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a number. \n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me try to think differently. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems incorrect because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression, but without any \\(c\\) terms. That is, it's asking for the coefficient when \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), because that's the only way the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would stand alone without any \\(c\\) factors. So, in that case, I would need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because that's the only term that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would result in a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nAh, that makes more sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nLet me calculate that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to the sum from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m\\). Simplifying the exponent, that becomes \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the exponent \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(6 = 2m\\), so \\(m = 3\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. \n\nTherefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which equals 120. \n\nWait, does that make sense? Let me double-check. \n\nSo, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Since we're multiplying these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But we only want the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, so that when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), we get just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think that makes sense now. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), giving \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^4 \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs is when \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\).

I need to find the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\). So, using the binomial theorem, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I want \\(a^2b^2\\), which means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient here would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the question is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term comes from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and since the second part is multiplied by it, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be 6 multiplied by something? Or does the second part affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)?\n\nWait, no, actually, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply two expressions, the variables are independent. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), does that mean the coefficient remains 6, and the rest of the terms involving \\(c\\) just get multiplied along, but since they are separate variables, they don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)?\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just 6 times whatever the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is. But wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all. So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times something. But in the overall expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term from the second expression. However, since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), does that mean that only the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)?\n\nWait, that might be. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term that has a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), then the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the constant term from the second expression will, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), result in a term that is exactly \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the constant term of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's apply the binomial theorem again. \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\) so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term of the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) just 6, and then because the second part is multiplied, the overall coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, including all the \\(c\\) terms? But no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a separate term, and when you multiply by the second polynomial, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, but only the constant term from the second part will result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms from the second part will have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), making the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the constant term contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present only once, multiplied by the constant term of the second expansion. All other terms will have additional factors of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so they don't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not exactly right because each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, setting \\(c = 1\\), \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64, which would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. But that contradicts my earlier conclusion of 120. Hmm, so now I'm confused.\n\nWait, no, that approach might not be correct because when you set \\(c = 1\\), you're not just summing the coefficients, but you're also including terms that have \\(c\\), which in this case, when \\(c = 1\\), they all become 1. So, the sum of the coefficients is indeed 64. But does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64? I don't think so because each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only multiplied by the constant term from the second polynomial to give a term without \\(c\\). All other terms from the second polynomial would result in terms with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which are different variables. So, maybe the correct approach is only to multiply by the constant term, which is 20, giving 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut then why does setting \\(c = 1\\) give me a different result? Let me think. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\), as I said. Then, the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 * 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems conflicting because earlier I thought it's 120.\n\nWait, but in reality, when \\(c = 1\\), all the terms in the second polynomial become 1, so when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by 64, you're effectively scaling the entire polynomial by 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384. But that's when \\(c = 1\\). However, the original problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, not when \\(c = 1\\). So, perhaps I'm mixing up two different things.\n\nWait, no, the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is determined by the terms that result in \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied. So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because any other term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would have a power of \\(c\\), making the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), which are not \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)), which is 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that setting \\(c = 1\\) gives a different result. Maybe that approach is not the right way to think about it because when \\(c = 1\\), we're evaluating the entire expression at \\(c = 1\\), which gives a different coefficient. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the value of \\(c\\). So, I think the correct approach is to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the constant term in the second polynomial, so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire product as a product of two polynomials, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. But that doesn't seem right because the second polynomial has variables \\(c\\), so unless we're considering the coefficient in a different way.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about it differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But earlier I thought it was 120. Now I'm confused.\n\nWait, no, I think I'm making a mistake here. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, but in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present when multiplied by the constant term in the second polynomial. All other terms would have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so they don't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient should be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut then why does setting \\(c = 1\\) give a different result? Because when \\(c = 1\\), all the terms in the second polynomial become 1, so the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 * 64\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. But that's when \\(c = 1\\). The original problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, not when \\(c = 1\\). So, I think the correct answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion is \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 (from \\(a\\)) multiplied by the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\), which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), so 1 * 2 = 2. But in reality, the term \\(a\\) is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, so the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 1 * (1 + 1) = 2, which is correct.\n\nBut in that case, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\), it's 1 * 2 = 2. Similarly, if I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{2}{2} = 1\\) multiplied by the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^2\\), which is \\(1 + 2 + 1 = 4\\), so 1 * 4 = 4. But in reality, the term \\(a^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, so the coefficient would be 1 * (1 + 2 + 1) = 4. But wait, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) is 4, which is correct.\n\nBut in the original problem, we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term. So, in the first polynomial, the coefficient is 6, and in the second polynomial, the constant term is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), then the coefficient is just 6 times the constant term of the second polynomial, which is 20, giving 120.\n\nI think I was confused earlier when I considered setting \\(c = 1\\) because that gives the sum of all coefficients, but in this problem, we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). So, the correct answer should be 120.\n\nWait, but to be thorough, let me think about the entire expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\) times each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply, you get \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives 2^6 = 64. So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut that contradicts my earlier conclusion of 120. Now I'm really confused. Which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misapplying the concept. The sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is indeed found by setting all variables to 1. So, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), setting \\(c = 1\\) gives 2^6 = 64, which is the sum of all coefficients. So, if I have a term in the first polynomial, say \\(a^2b^2\\), and I multiply it by the entire second polynomial, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut that seems to suggest that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384, which is different from 120. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which includes terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each of those, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c\\), \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), etc., but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) specifically is only the part that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, in reality, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just 6 times the constant term of the second polynomial, which is 20, giving 120.\n\nBut then why does the sum of coefficients approach give a different answer? I think the key is that when you set \\(c = 1\\), you're effectively evaluating the entire product at \\(c = 1\\), which gives you the sum of all coefficients, including those multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is a specific term, not the sum of all coefficients.\n\nSo, to clarify, if I have two polynomials, \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), then the coefficient of a specific term in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by \\(Q(c)\\) is equal to the coefficient of that term in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the entire polynomial \\(Q(c)\\). But in this case, \\(Q(c)\\) is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which includes terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(Q(c)\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in \\(Q(c)\\), which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), etc., and the constant term.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is only the part where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is the constant term of \\(Q(c)\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but if I think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it's the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, that would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\) would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but in reality, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so in the product, it's only present when multiplied by the constant term of the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think I was confused earlier because I was considering setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives the sum of all coefficients, but that's not what the problem is asking for. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial, which is 6, and multiply it by the constant term of the second polynomial, which is 20, giving 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by considering the term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

It states that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^k\\). So, applying this to \\((a + b)^4\\), each term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. Similarly, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term would be \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWait, so the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but this term is only in the first part, right? Because the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) in them. So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part? Or do I need to consider any cross terms?\n\nWait, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. But since the second polynomial only has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by any term from the second part. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all terms in the second part, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is raised to the 6th power.\n\nWait, no, actually, no. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part, each of which has some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think we just need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and then multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that seems like it would be a sum of coefficients, which might not make sense.\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is of the form (term from first part) times (term from second part). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nBut wait, no, because each term in the second part has a different power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will have coefficients multiplied by each term in the second part. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, does that mean we just take the coefficient from the first part and multiply it by the entire second part? That doesn't seem right because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's a single coefficient, which suggests that we're looking for the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so perhaps it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all terms from the second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is separate.\n\nWait, maybe the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the other variables. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem doesn't specify \\(k\\), so maybe it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part, which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times 64\\). Let me check that.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right because the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the sum of its coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is indeed \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, if we set \\(c = 1\\), the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(64 \\times \\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that.\n\n\\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), so \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, the coefficient would be 384. But wait, is that correct? Because when you set \\(c = 1\\), you're effectively summing all the coefficients of the second part, which gives you the total coefficient contribution from the second part. So, yes, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of two separate expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the second part, when multiplied, contributes all its terms, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me try expanding both parts separately.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\). The expansion is:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6.\n\nNext, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which are \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by each coefficient from the second part, but since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum all the coefficients from the second part and multiply by 6.\n\nWait, but no, that's not quite right. Because each term from the second part has a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second part, you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients from the second part multiplied by 6. Because each term \\(6a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) has a coefficient of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), and when you sum over all \\(m\\), you get \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), which is \\(6 \\times 2^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nSo, that seems correct. Alternatively, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), and \\((a + b)^4\\) evaluated at \\(c = 1\\) is just \\((a + b)^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there a possibility that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's not stated? The problem just says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think it's safe to assume that it's regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so the sum of all coefficients from the second part.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that the entire expression is a product, and so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply polynomials, each term is multiplied by every term in the other polynomial, so the coefficients do get scaled by the entire second polynomial.\n\nWait, but actually, no. Because when you have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the constant term in \\(c\\). Because if we set \\(c^0\\), that would make sense as a single coefficient.\n\nWait, that's a good point. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. So, in that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the entire product. That would make more sense because it's a single coefficient.\n\nSo, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), we need to consider the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by the term in the second part that has \\(c^0\\). So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when the exponent is zero. From the expansion, each term is \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\), so setting \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, that's the answer. But wait, the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), it just said \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I'm overcomplicating again. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem is: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean that we're summing over all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense for a single coefficient.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the intended interpretation is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. Because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a single number. So, I think that's the right approach. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me think again. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the second part multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. So, that would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that would mean the coefficient is 384, and the term would be \\(384a^2b^2c^6 + 384a^2b^2c^4 + \\dots + 384a^2b^2c^{-6}\\), which seems odd because the coefficient is the same for all powers of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the second part has a different coefficient.\n\nWait, no, actually, each term in the second part has its own coefficient, so when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second part, you get \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) is \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's actually the sum of all these coefficients, which would be \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 6 \\times 2^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nBut that would mean the coefficient is 384, and the term would be \\(384a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\), which is the same as the second part evaluated at \\(c = 1\\). So, perhaps that's the intended answer.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, which is it?\n\nWait, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that we need to find the coefficient when the product is expanded and only the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is considered, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a single number, so that can't be.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify \\(c^0\\), so perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients from the second part multiplied by 6, giving 384.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused now. Let me try to clarify.\n\nWhen you have two separate variables, like \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in one part and \\(c\\) in another, the terms are independent. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which are \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nBut the sum of all coefficients in the second part is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Therefore, the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit counterintuitive because the second part has different powers of \\(c\\), but the problem is only asking about \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 384, as each term in the second part contributes its coefficient to the product.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would have to find the corresponding term. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think the intended answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), and the coefficient of \\(b\\) is also \\(c + 1/c\\). So, if I were to ask for the coefficient of \\(a\\), it's \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But if I set \\(c = 1\\), then the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, which is the sum of the coefficients in the second part.\n\nSo, in that case, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a\\) in \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), the answer would be \\(c + 1/c\\), but if it asked for the coefficient of \\(a\\) when \\(c = 1\\), it would be 2.\n\nBut in our original problem, the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying \\(c\\). So, perhaps the answer is \\(6 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a single number. Therefore, maybe the problem expects us to consider that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire second polynomial, but that doesn't make sense because coefficients are numbers, not polynomials.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, the coefficient is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20, giving 120.\n\nBut I'm still a bit unsure. Let me try to see if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAnother approach: To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, we can consider that in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6. The other part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms with different powers of \\(c\\). Since the problem is only asking about \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a single number. Therefore, the only way to get a numerical coefficient is to consider a specific power of \\(c\\), such as \\(c^0\\), which gives us 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), then perhaps it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. But that seems odd because the coefficient would then be the same for all powers of \\(c\\), which isn't the case.\n\nWait, no, actually, each term in the product has a specific power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would vary depending on the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the only way to get a single numerical coefficient is to consider a specific power of \\(c\\), such as \\(c^0\\), which gives us 120.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me compute the expansion step by step.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nNext, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, the expansion is:\n\n- \\(m=0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1 \\times c^6\\)\n- \\(m=1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^4 = 6c^4\\)\n- \\(m=2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^2 = 15c^2\\)\n- \\(m=3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\\)\n- \\(m=4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(m=5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(m=6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion.\n\nSo, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part:\n\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times c^6 = 6c^6a^2b^2\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 6c^4 = 36c^4a^2b^2\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 15c^2 = 90c^2a^2b^2\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 120a^2b^2\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 15c^{-2} = 90c^{-2}a^2b^2\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 6c^{-4} = 36c^{-4}a^2b^2\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times c^{-6} = 6c^{-6}a^2b^2\\)\n\nSo, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) appears in each of these products with different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually a polynomial in \\(c\\), specifically:\n\n\\(6c^6 + 36c^4 + 90c^2 + 120 + 90c^{-2} + 36c^{-4} + 6c^{-6}\\)\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which, without specifying the power of \\(c\\), is ambiguous. However, if we interpret it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), then the coefficient is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean summing all the coefficients from the second part, that would be:\n\n\\(6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6 = 384\\)\n\nBut that's the sum of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^6, a^2b^2c^4, \\dots, a^2b^2c^{-6}\\), which is the same as evaluating the second part at \\(c = 1\\) and multiplying by 6, giving 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut I think the intended interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but I'm still confused because the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\). Maybe I should look for similar problems or think about how such questions are usually phrased.\n\nIn most cases, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a term involving multiple variables, it's usually in the context of a single term, so if it's asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), it's likely referring to the term where the other variables (in this case, \\(c\\)) are at a specific power, often zero. So, I think the answer is 120.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me consider both interpretations.\n\nFirst interpretation: The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nSecond interpretation: The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nGiven that the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), I'm now leaning towards the first interpretation, that the coefficient is 384, because when you multiply the two polynomials, each term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nBut I'm still a bit unsure because I've seen problems where they ask for the coefficient of a term with specific variables, and implicitly, they're considering the other variables at a specific power, often zero.\n\nWait, let me think about the problem again. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nIf I consider that the entire expression is a product, and I'm only interested in the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the second part multiplied by 6, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I'm only interested in the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears with \\(c^0\\), then it's 120.\n\nGiven that the problem didn't specify \\(c\\), I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nBut to confirm, let me think about another example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get:\n\n\\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\)\n\nSo, the term \\(ab\\) would have a coefficient of \\(2c + 2/c\\). So, if the problem asked for the coefficient of \\(ab\\), it would be \\(2c + 2/c\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(ab\\) when \\(c = 1\\), it would be 4.\n\nBut in our original problem, the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying \\(c\\), so it's ambiguous. However, in most problems like this, when they ask for the coefficient of a term with certain variables, they're implicitly considering the other variables at a specific power, often zero. So, perhaps the answer is 120.\n\nBut I'm still not entirely sure. Let me try to see if there's a way to interpret the problem where the coefficient is 384.\n\nIf I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = 64\\), and \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\) would have coefficients multiplied by 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, in that case, the answer is 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I set \\(c = 1\\), I'm effectively summing all the coefficients of the second part, which gives me the total contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from all terms in the second part.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but in the earlier example, when I set \\(c = 1\\), the coefficient of \\(ab\\) became 4, which is the sum of coefficients from the second part. So, in that case, the answer would be 4, which is the sum of the coefficients of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which is 2 + 2 = 4.\n\nSimilarly, in our problem, setting \\(c = 1\\) gives us the sum of coefficients from the second part, which is 64, and multiplying by 6 gives 384.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nBut wait, in the earlier expansion, when I multiplied \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second part, I saw that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120, which is different from 384.\n\nSo, perhaps the confusion arises from whether the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384, or the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nGiven that the problem didn't specify \\(c\\), I think the answer is 384.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me check with another approach.\n\nAnother approach: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part, considering that the variables are independent. So, the coefficient from the first part is 6, and the coefficient from the second part is the sum of all coefficients, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion is found by considering the contributions from both parts of the expression. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " Maybe I should start by expanding each part separately and then see how they combine.\n\nSo, let's start with \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, which states that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^{k}\\), I can write this as:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\n\\]\n\nI need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I should find the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, let's calculate the binomial coefficient for that term:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. That part seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient of some term in this expansion as well, but wait, the original problem is about \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think about that.\n\nWait, actually, the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will multiply each term from the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can treat the second part as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Is that correct?\n\nLet me clarify. If I have two polynomials multiplied together, say \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), then the coefficient of a specific term in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the entire \\(Q(c)\\) would just be the coefficient from \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). But wait, no, that's not exactly right because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) has different powers of \\(c\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just the product of the coefficient from \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, but that might not be accurate either. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply these, each term in the expansion will be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all terms in the product where the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts are \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) parts. But wait, actually, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when multiplied, will contribute a factor that is a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, since the original question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's just the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part, but that seems too broad.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\). So, actually, in the product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\), that would be a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would require \\(k = 0\\). So, I think I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part.\n\nOkay, that makes sense. So, first, I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's work on that.\n\nAgain, using the binomial theorem for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which can be written as:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nI need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, I set the exponent equal to zero:\n\n\\[\n6 - 2m = 0 \\implies 2m = 6 \\implies m = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\). Let's compute that:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{6 - 2 \\times 3} = \\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nSo, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 20, so 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the constant term in the second part is 20. When I multiply these two, I get 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of the entire expression as the product of two polynomials, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each part, since the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, yes, I think 120 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, just to double-check, let me consider the expansion more carefully. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\), we need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20. So, the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nI think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^{k}\\). So maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLet me start by looking at the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). If I expand this using the binomial theorem, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. So, the possible terms are:\n\n- When \\(k = 0\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 = 1 \\cdot a^4\\)\n- When \\(k = 1\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 = 4a^3b\\)\n- When \\(k = 2\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\)\n- When \\(k = 3\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 = 4ab^3\\)\n- When \\(k = 4\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4 = 1 \\cdot b^4\\)\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. That part seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, so does that mean I need to consider how \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)?\n\nHmm, maybe not directly. Let me think. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are multiplied by the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the variables are different. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) regardless of the other terms, because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables. But that seems too simple. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, but since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), perhaps the coefficient remains 6, and the rest of the expression just adds more terms without affecting the \\(a^2b^2\\) term's coefficient. But that seems unlikely because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression.\n\nWait, no, actually, no. Wait, because \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all separate variables. So when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term from the first expansion gets multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all, perhaps only the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that have \\(c^0\\) (i.e., the constant term) will contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term because any other term would introduce a power of \\(c\\), which isn't present in \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, so that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term we're interested in. All other terms would have some power of \\(c\\), which we don't want.\n\nSo, let me break this down. First, as I found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Once I have that, I can multiply it by 6 to get the final coefficient.\n\nAlright, so how do I find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k}\\) which is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, I set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) and solve for \\(k\\). That gives \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20. So when you multiply these two terms together, you get \\(6a^2b^2 * 20c^0 = 120a^2b^2\\). So, yes, the coefficient is 120.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire product as \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so when you expand it, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the term where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\) and the \\(c\\) terms cancel out (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the coefficient of \\(c^0\\). So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, setting \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\), which is 20 * 1 = 20. That's correct.\n\nAnd for \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\), so \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), which is correct.\n\nTherefore, multiplying them gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the correct coefficient.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe using generating functions or something else.\n\nAlternatively, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, that would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, another thought: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. But in this case, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate variables, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiply it by the constant term from the second polynomial. So, there's no other combination because any other term from the second polynomial would involve \\(c\\) raised to some power, which we don't want in the term \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, we find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\):\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\n\\]\n\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). We need the coefficient of the constant term \\(c^0\\):\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nWe set the exponent of \\(c\\) to 0:\n\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nFinally, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Maybe I should start by expanding each part separately and then see how they combine.\n\nSo, let's break it down. The expression is the product of two parts: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since these are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from the terms in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that result in the desired term. Wait, but hold on, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so maybe the other part involving \\(c\\) doesn't affect it? Or does it?\n\nWait, no, that's not right. The entire expression is a product of two parts, each of which can contribute terms. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), maybe the coefficient is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be multiplied by something else. Maybe I need to consider how the terms combine when multiplying the two expansions.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, when you multiply out \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by taking the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiplying it by the term that is 1 in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because any other term in the second expansion would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, which we don't want in \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, so if I can find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), and then find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (which is 1) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the overall coefficient would be the product of these two coefficients. That makes sense because when you multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by 1 from the second part, so the coefficient would be the product of the individual coefficients.\n\nOkay, let's start with the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\).\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms. So, when you expand this using the binomial theorem, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nNow, since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\) (which is 1) in the second expansion, the overall coefficient is the product of the two coefficients: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Is there any possibility that I'm missing something? For instance, could there be other terms in the second expansion that somehow contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without involving \\(c\\)? I don't think so because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so their terms don't interfere. So, yes, the coefficient should indeed be 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire product as a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficients multiply. That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, so their product is 120. That seems consistent.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. The binomial coefficients seem correct, and the reasoning about the exponents makes sense. So, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\).
