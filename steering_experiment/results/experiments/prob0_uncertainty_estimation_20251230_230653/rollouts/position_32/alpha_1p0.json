Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would indeed be multiplied by every term in the second part.

So, again, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. I think that's solid. Let me just check if I made any calculation errors. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is indeed 6, because 4 choose 2 is (4\u00d73)/(2\u00d71) = 6.

    "text": " Wait, let me write it more clearly. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, I need to find the value of \\(k\\) such that the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because \\(c^0 = 1\\), which is the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from the first part) and 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes here. So, I found that in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, which seems correct because \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I needed the constant term, which occurs when the exponent is 0. So, setting \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. Hmm, that seems right. But wait, is there a possibility that the terms from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) could interact with the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms in a way that affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is being multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, the only way to get a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\) (without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\)) is if it's multiplied by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) in the second expression. If it's multiplied by any other term in the second expression, like \\(c^k\\) where \\(k \\neq 0\\), then the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the constant term in the second expression contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, my initial approach was correct: multiply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, resulting in 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's the right answer. Let me just check with an alternative approach to be absolutely sure.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the entire expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since the constant term is 20, as we found, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, the combined coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, if I were to expand the entire product, I would have terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), but only when \\(k = 0\\) would the term be \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, yes, that confirms it. The coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) more explicitly. The expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, the terms are:\n\n- For \\(k=0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1 \\times c^6 = c^6\\)\n- For \\(k=1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^{4} = 6c^4\\)\n- For \\(k=2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^{2} = 15c^2\\)\n- For \\(k=3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\)\n- For \\(k=4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- For \\(k=5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- For \\(k=6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the constant term is indeed 20, as I found earlier. Therefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the only term that will contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) is the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second expression. So, 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other way that \\(a^2b^2\\) could be formed. For example, could there be a case where, when multiplying terms from \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the \\(c\\) terms somehow cancel out in a way that affects the \\(a^2b^2\\) term? But no, because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so when you multiply them, you can't have \\(c\\) terms affecting the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, each term in the product will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{-m}\\), but not a combination that affects the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term with the constant term in the second polynomial. So, yes, 120 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to think about generating functions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the product of the coefficients from each generating function where the exponents add up appropriately. But in this case, since the second generating function doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents, it's just the product of the individual coefficients, as I did before.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together to get 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Wait, let me think. The general term in the expansion would be \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two parts, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is multiplied by the constant term in the second part, giving \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, that seems right. Let me think again: when you expand \\((a + b)^4\\), you get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). Similarly, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will have terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(1/c^6\\). When you multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can ignore all terms from the second expansion that have a power of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), because those would result in terms that have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), which are not the same as \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 (i.e., the constant term) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. So, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, that's correct because 4 choose 2 is 6. And \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20, which is also correct because 6 choose 3 is 20. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. So, yeah, I think that's the right answer.\n\nI guess another way to think about it is that the entire expression is a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficients multiply when you're looking for terms that don't involve any variables from the other expansion. So, in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the product of the coefficient from the first expansion and the constant term from the second. So, yeah, 120 is the answer.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. It seems straightforward once you break it down into two separate binomial expansions and realize that only the constant term in the second expansion affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be found by considering the binomial expansions of each part separately.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 20.\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both expansions:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."
