So, when I multiply these two, I get 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. But just to make sure, let me think about it again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, and the term \\(c^0\\) in the other expansion is 20. So, when I multiply them, I get 6 * 20 a\u00b2b\u00b2, which is 120a\u00b2b\u00b2. So yes, the coefficient is 120. I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem by considering the entire product and how the terms interact. But I think the method I used is solid because I'm only looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, it's just the product of the two coefficients I found. I don't think I made any mistakes in the binomial coefficients. 4 choose 2 is 6, and 6 choose 3 is 20. Multiplying them gives 120.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the first part is correct: in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, in the second part, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(c\\) cancels out (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) occurs when the exponent is 0, which happens at \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is 20. So, when we multiply the two polynomials, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term (20) from the second part, resulting in \\(6 * 20 = 120\\). That seems correct. Alternatively, if I think about it another way: when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the term that results in \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), it must come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial and the constant term in the second polynomial. So, yes, that would be 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me check if there's any other term that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by terms from the second polynomial. For example, could a term like \\(a^3b\\) from the first polynomial multiply with a term involving \\(c\\) such that the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, but that would still leave an \\(ab\\) term, not \\(a^2b^2\\). Similarly, \\(ab^3\\) would multiply with a \\(c\\) term, but again, that wouldn't give \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a constant term in the second polynomial. So, I think my initial reasoning is correct.

    "text": " Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, correct. Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20, correct. So, when you multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion, which is 20. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. I think that makes sense. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem to confirm. Alternatively, I could consider the entire expansion of both expressions and look for the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\). Since the second expression only contributes a scalar multiple (the constant term) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would indeed be the product of the two coefficients. So, yeah, 120 seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes here.
