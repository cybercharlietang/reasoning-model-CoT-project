Since these two terms are multiplied together in the overall expression, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me just double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 is when \\(k = 3\\), and that coefficient is 20. So, when you multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will multiply the constant term from the second part, giving \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Are there any other terms that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. If I took a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that had a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), then when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would result in a term like \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), which are not \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the constant term in the second polynomial contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. Therefore, 120 should be the correct coefficient. I don't think I made any mistakes here, but let me just recap to make sure. We have two separate binomial expansions. The first one gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second one gives a constant term with coefficient 20. Multiplying these gives 120.

The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\): \\(6 = 2m\\) \u2192 \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the one with \\(c^0\\). The coefficient for this term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(m = 3\\), so that's 20. Multiplying them together, 6 * 20 is 120. That seems right. I don't think I made a mistake here. So, yeah, the coefficient should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by considering the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Multiplying these gives 120.\n\n\\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, I'm considering that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part only pairs with the constant term in the second part to give a term without \\(c\\).
