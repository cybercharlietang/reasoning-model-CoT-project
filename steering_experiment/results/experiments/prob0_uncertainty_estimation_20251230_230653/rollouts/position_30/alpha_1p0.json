    "text": " I think this is another binomial expansion. Let me write it out. Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(c\\) equal to \\(6 - 2m\\). I need the term where the exponent is 0 because I'm looking for \\(c^0\\). So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the one with \\(c^0\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the other part is 20. Since these two are multiplied together in the product, the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6, as \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For the other part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent is 0 occurs at \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when you multiply these two, you get 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Hmm, does that make sense? Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then it's multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only term that contributes is the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20. So, yes, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so when you expand it, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the term in the first expansion times the constant term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\).

The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each expansion:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Simplifying the exponents, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(6 - 2m\\). I need the term where the exponent is 0, so I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients I found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient should be 120. Wait, but let me double-check that. So, when we multiply the two expansions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the term where the product doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, it's only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, that would be the term where the \\(c\\) exponent is zero in the second polynomial, which we found as 20, and the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial, which is 6. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. That makes sense. Let me see if there's another way to think about it. Alternatively, since the two polynomials are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial. Because any other term in the second polynomial would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) term, which would make the term have \\(c\\) powers, but since we're only looking for the term without \\(c\\), it's only the product of those two coefficients. So, yes, 6 times 20 is 120. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial would be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second polynomial, which is the term with \\(c^0\\). So, that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. So, yeah, I think that's right.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the entire expression is the product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. Because any other term in the second part would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) term, which would make the term have \\(c\\) factors, but since we're only interested in the term that's purely \\(a^2b^2\\), it must be multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion. So, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me write out the product:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\nand\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15\\dfrac{1}{c^2} + 6\\dfrac{1}{c^4} + \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\n\\]\n\nSo, when we multiply these two, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have coefficients multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the term that doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, that's when the second factor is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, that's consistent with what I thought earlier. Therefore, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think if there's any other way this could be interpreted. For example, is there a possibility that the problem is asking for the coefficient in the expanded form, which might involve cross terms or something else? But no, the problem specifically asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so it's only the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\). So, as long as the \\(c\\) part is neutral (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present. So, yeah, 120 is correct.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. So, the final answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from the two expansions:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."
