    "text": " Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the next part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I think I can expand this as well using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, \\(\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = c^{-m}\\), so each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the problem is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which we've found to be 6. But wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think we can consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and then it's multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, that might not be the case. Let me think again. Wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times c^{6 - 2m}\\) for some \\(m\\), but wait, that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and the coefficient would be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), that would mean we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because when we multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. So, let me find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, from earlier, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(2m = 6\\), which means \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Since the two parts are multiplied together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by the second expansion, each term will have a power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanded, each term will be of the form (coefficient from first part) * (coefficient from second part) * a^something * b^something * c^something. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that can't be right either because \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and when you multiply by the second part, which is in terms of \\(c\\), you'd have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would appear in the product multiplied by each term of the second expansion, meaning that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems incorrect because the coefficient should be a constant, not a polynomial in \\(c\\). Wait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a function of \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense for a coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Let me check the original problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, it just says \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but maybe that's implied because otherwise, the coefficient would depend on \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense. So, I think the intended interpretation is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which we found to be 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Let me verify this again. From \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. From \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. Therefore, the answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times whatever the entire second part is? Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. But in this case, the first part has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), and the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the question is considering the entire product, and in that product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by some terms involving \\(c\\), but the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems a bit odd. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and then considering that it's multiplied by the entire second part, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of the second part. But I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a product, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be part of the product, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. But the problem asks for the coefficient, which is usually a number. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, which has a coefficient of 6. The second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has terms involving different powers of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply the two parts together, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems like the coefficient would be a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a scalar. Wait, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then the rest is just multiplied as a constant factor. But that doesn't make sense because \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is not a constant. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, so 6, and the second part is just another factor that doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, maybe the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expression. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which is not typical. Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product, and in that product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just 6 times the sum of all terms in the second expansion. But that's not correct because each term in the second expansion would be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), but the coefficient would be 6 times each of those terms. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. When you have two expressions multiplied together, like (P)(Q), the coefficient of a specific term in P is multiplied by the entire Q. So, for example, if P has a term 6a^2b^2, then in the product (P)(Q), the term 6a^2b^2Q would be part of the product. So, the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the product would be 6 times Q. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the first part, ignoring the second part, which would be 6. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes the second part in the expression. Hmm, maybe I need to look at the problem differently. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of a^2b^2c^k for some k, but it's only asking for a^2b^2, so perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that doesn't make sense either. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a separate expansion, so the overall coefficient is 6. But that seems too simple. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the entire product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which is not a single number. Wait, maybe the problem is mistyped, and it's supposed to be in the entire product, but only considering the a and b terms, and ignoring c. But that's unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a constant factor. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which isn't a constant. Hmm, maybe I need to think differently. Let me try to write out the entire expression. So, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of a^2b^2 is 6. Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Now, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is not a single number. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is usually a scalar. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering that the expression is a product, so the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. But in this case, the first part's coefficient is 6, and the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has a constant term when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which is when \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part, when multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Because when you multiply by the constant term, you get a term with \\(a^2b^2c^0 = a^2b^2\\). Whereas, if you multiply by other terms in the second expansion, you'd get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^2\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^2\\), etc., but those wouldn't contribute to the coefficient of just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the constant term in the second expansion would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part to give a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

But that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, no, that's not correct either because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second, but the variables are separate. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all terms in the second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the second expansion has terms in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so unless we're looking for a specific term in \\(c\\), but the problem doesn't specify. Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. That can't be right because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a number. Therefore, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, perhaps that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, but that would be 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), which is 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), so we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. Let me check that. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I found earlier. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion to get \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, let's compute that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the answer should be 120. Let me just verify that. Alternatively, maybe the problem is not considering \\(c\\) at all, but I think that's unlikely because the expression includes both \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\). So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would be 6 times \\(2^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that seems too large, and I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without considering \\(c\\), which would be 6, but that seems too simple given the presence of \\(c\\) in the expression. I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, but that would be 6 times \\(2^6 = 384\\). But that seems high. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is simply 6, because the other part doesn't affect the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). But that doesn't seem right either because when you multiply by the second expansion, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficients would combine. Wait, no, the variables are separate. So, when you have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, because the other part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, maybe the answer is 6. But I'm confused now because earlier I thought it was 120, but now I'm thinking it's 6. Let me clarify. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m c^{-n}\\), but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, because the other part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the answer is 6. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 120. I'm getting conflicting conclusions. Let me try to think differently. Suppose I expand the entire expression. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and is multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be 6 times \\(2^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 384, but that seems too large, and I don't think that's the case because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6, and the rest is irrelevant. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 times 20 = 120. I think that's the more likely case because otherwise, the problem would be too straightforward. So, to resolve this, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Therefore, the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20.

    "text": " Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean that the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, let me think. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should just be a number, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". Oh, maybe the problem is considering all terms, including those with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems too large. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a single number, not a polynomial. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6\\(a^2b^2\\). Then, when you multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will be multiplied by 6\\(a^2b^2\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's just 6 times whatever the expansion of the other part is. But that doesn't seem right because the other part has variables, so the coefficient should be a number. Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because if we consider the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), so the only term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is when we take the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, maybe the coefficient is 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense. So, first, I'll find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that using the binomial theorem. \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, let me check that again. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6\\(a^2b^2\\). Then, when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of the second part will be multiplied by 6\\(a^2b^2\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think we're considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), but the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient is a number, not a function of \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. That would make sense. So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by the constant term in the second part, which is 20, giving 120. So, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering all terms, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right because coefficients are usually constants. So, I think the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Therefore, the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

That suggests that maybe the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), or perhaps it's a separate part that we don't need to consider for the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Let me think. Since we're multiplying two expressions together, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just 6, because when you multiply by 1 (from the other expression), the coefficient remains the same. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) does have terms, but maybe when we multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only affected by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because otherwise, you'd have extra factors of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would change the term. So, perhaps I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient from the first part. That makes sense because if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by, say, \\(c^k\\), that would be a term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would come from the term where \\(c^k\\) is \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me apply the binomial theorem again to this expression. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when we multiply these two parts together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. So, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives us \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives us a constant term 20. So, when we multiply these two, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that when we multiply the two expressions, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, which doesn't involve \\(c\\), it must come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part and the constant term in the second part. So, yes, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that makes sense.

Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to consider the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. Actually, when you have a product of two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term in the second expression, the variables don't interfere, so the coefficient just gets scaled by the sum of the coefficients of the second expression. So, the coefficient we're looking for is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, how do I find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Well, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64.

Let me think again: when you have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and since it's multiplied by the entire second part, the coefficient is indeed 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, but wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Alternatively, maybe I should expand both parts and look for the specific term, but that seems more complicated.

So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider how many times \\(a^2b^2\\) appears when multiplied by terms from the second expansion.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is separate. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion by each term from the second expansion. But since the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), each term from the second expansion is just a constant (in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)). Therefore, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(c\\) is separate, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not just a number. Wait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all variables, but that doesn't make sense because \\(c\\) is separate. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, but the exponents of \\(c\\) can be anything. But then, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a bit strange. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would mean evaluating \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) at \\(c = 1\\), which gives the sum of coefficients. Let me check that. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, if I do that, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that seems unlikely because coefficients are usually constants, not expressions in other variables.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that we need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which would be the constant term in the second expansion. Let me check that. So, if that's the case, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 20, which is 120. Hmm, that seems plausible. But wait, the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a bit odd because it would result in a polynomial in \\(c\\). But maybe that's the case. Let me think again. If I expand the entire expression, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives terms in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When I multiply them together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, which are \\(c^6, 6c^4, 15c^2, 20, 15c^{-2}, 6c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), meaning that the coefficient is \\(6(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6})\\). But that seems too complicated, and I don't think that's what the problem is asking. The problem is likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. As I calculated before, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, I'm not sure. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's only specifying \\(a^2b^2\\), not mentioning \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is considering \\(c\\) as another variable, and the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But usually, when a problem asks for a coefficient, it's in terms of specific variables, and if other variables are present, they are treated as constants. But in this case, since \\(c\\) is another variable, the coefficient would indeed be a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times the expansion I did earlier. But that seems a bit odd because the answer would be a polynomial, not a single number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider only the constant term in \\(c\\), i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so that the coefficient is a number. In that case, as I calculated before, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to treat \\(c\\) as a constant and just find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and the second part is just a constant factor, but that doesn't make sense because \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is not a constant unless \\(c\\) is given a specific value. Wait, maybe the problem is expecting me to multiply the coefficients, treating each part separately. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the entire second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a separate polynomial. So, when I multiply them together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems like the answer would be a polynomial, not a single number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider the entire product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. Given that the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think the most reasonable interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is expecting me to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. But I'm not sure. Let me think about how these kinds of problems are usually structured. Typically, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term in a product of two expressions, you need to consider how the term is formed. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by each term from the second part. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by each term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number, not a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient as a polynomial in \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems complicated, and I don't think that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But again, that seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when \\(c\\) is set to 1, which would make the second part equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\), so the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if \\(c\\) is set to 1, then the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 * 64\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is expecting me to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But I think the problem is more likely expecting a numerical answer, so probably 384 or 120. Given that, I think the more plausible answer is 120, considering that the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). Let me confirm that. So, if I consider the term \\(a^2b^2\\) and also the constant term in \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, if I consider all terms in \\(c\\), then it's 6 * 64 = 384. But since the problem didn't specify, I'm not sure. Wait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to multiply the two coefficients, treating each expansion separately, but that doesn't make sense because they are multiplied together. I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me try to think differently. Suppose I expand both parts:\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nSecond, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6). So, that's a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, perhaps the answer is this polynomial. But that seems complicated. Alternatively, if the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, perhaps it's considering \\(c\\) as 1, so the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if it's expecting the coefficient when \\(c\\) is at its lowest power, but that seems unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the second part, but that would be 6, which seems too simple. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But I think the problem is more likely expecting a numerical answer, so perhaps it's 384 or 120. Given that, I think the more plausible answer is 120, considering that the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when \\(c\\) is at its zero power, i.e., the constant term. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, I think the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) includes terms with various powers of \\(c\\). However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, we need to consider how this coefficient interacts with the second expansion.\n\n   When multiplying \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can treat the second expansion as a single factor when calculating this coefficient.\n\n   Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is simply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since we're looking for a numerical coefficient, we need to evaluate the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\n   The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n   \n   Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

That means I don't need to worry about the other terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when I multiply the two expressions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will just be multiplied by the constant term (if any) from the second part, or more accurately, it's a separate part of the product. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would mean we're looking for the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) is still \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part. Let me check that. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I expand each part separately, then the product will have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) ranges from -6 to 6, depending on how the second expansion goes. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that corresponds to \\(k = 2\\) in the first part, giving \\(a^2b^2\\), and in the second part, we need the term that has \\(c^0\\), because \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0 = a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me apply the binomial theorem to this as well. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the constant term. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, that's 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). Let me compute that: 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. Wait, but just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me double-check each step. First, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). That seems correct. Then, expanding \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Then, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it another way. The entire expression is the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed the product of the coefficient from each part where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) match what we're looking for, and the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero. So, yeah, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\).

Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are only in the second part. So, when I multiply them together, the variables from the first part (\\(a\\) and \\(b\\)) won't interact with the variables in the second part (\\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\)). That means the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will just be multiplied by every term in the second part, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's only about the coefficient in the first part, and the second part can be anything because it's multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so it doesn't affect the exponent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, no, actually, I think I'm overcomplicating it. Let me clarify: The expression is a product of two separate binomial expansions. So, the first part gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But when you multiply them together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second part, the only term in the second expansion that will affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the constant term, because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term that has \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), you'll end up with terms like \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), but the problem is just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. Wait, that makes sense. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by 6. So, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, correct. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me think again: when you multiply two expressions, the terms combine. So, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\). Wait, but in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes terms with \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), etc., down to \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only come from the term where the second part is 1 (i.e., the constant term). Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\), it's \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't the same as \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the only contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20. So, the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.

Wait, no, that might not be the case. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire product and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, and since the other part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this product, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a^2b^2. When multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), this becomes 6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not an expression. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That would make sense because then we're looking for a specific term in the product. So, let me consider that. If that's the case, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering only the terms where \\(c^0\\) is present would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, first, as before, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That is, \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), so 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We seek the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient here is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both expansions:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, I need to consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as well. But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is part of the first factor. The second factor, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will contribute terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since the problem is only about \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), I think I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. The entire expression is the product of the two expansions. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term only involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the corresponding terms in the second expansion must be the constant term, because otherwise, the product would involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which we don't want. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me figure that out. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is also a binomial expansion. Using the binomial theorem, it's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and the constant term in the other expansion is 20. So, when we multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me just double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. So, I think the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion is found by considering each part separately. First, \\((a + b)^4\\) has a coefficient of 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\). Next, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a constant term of 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

The other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), their coefficients won't be affected by the \\(c\\) terms.

But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that means we only need to consider the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, the expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\). Therefore, when we multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a single number, not a polynomial in \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider the entire expansion and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that still doesn't make sense because \\(c\\) terms are separate. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which should be a constant. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Wait, no, the problem just says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that it's considering the expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and wants the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that's not standard. Usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term in a product of polynomials, you have to specify all the variables. So, perhaps the problem is miswritten, or maybe I'm misinterpreting it. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unusual. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that when you multiply the two expansions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient is supposed to be a number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to compute the product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but that would mean treating \\(c\\) as a variable separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so the coefficient would indeed be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems complicated, and I don't think that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider only the constant term in \\(c\\), that is, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be the constant term in \\(c\\).

That would make the coefficient a single number. Let me try that approach. So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I calculated earlier. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the constant term, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.

Wait, but actually, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are only in the first part, and the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when we multiply the two expressions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion.

But that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is not typically what is asked. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). Let me assume that's the case. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that using the binomial theorem. \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the constant term in the second expansion is 20. Now, going back to the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. So, when we multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 * 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me double-check that. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we're considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. But since the problem didn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion.

But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. But I think that's not what the problem is asking. The problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120. Let me see if that makes sense. So, to recap: The first part gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second part, when expanded, has a constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) of 20. So, when multiplying, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(20c^0\\), resulting in \\(120a^2b^2c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. Alternatively, if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial, but that seems unlikely. So, I think the intended answer is 120. Let me confirm by another approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the entire expansion. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, each term in the first expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\) and each term in the second expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). When multiplying, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(k = 2\\) in the first expansion, which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). Then, this term is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's considering the entire expression and the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but that's not typical. Alternatively, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 6 times the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, so 120. Alternatively, if we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire second expansion, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which seems unlikely. So, I think the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Therefore, the answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20.

So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then we would need to sum all the coefficients from the second expansion and multiply by 6. Alternatively, if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part because each term in the second part contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would be a term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But if the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then yes, it's 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would have to find the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion and multiply by 6. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), I think 384 is the answer. Let me verify this by considering a simpler case. Suppose we have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) is also \\(c + 1/c\\). So, if I were to find the coefficient of \\(a^1\\) in the entire expression, it would be \\(c + 1/c\\), which is the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion. Similarly, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first expansion (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion (which is 64), giving 384. So, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to consider the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) because the problem is only concerned with the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, perhaps the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I have to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by some term from the second part. But wait, does that affect the coefficient? Because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what happens with \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. Wait, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the entire product. So, that would mean that in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some combination of terms from the second expansion. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, perhaps that's not the case. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would include all the terms from the second expansion. But that doesn't make much sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term with only \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part has only \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is some exponent. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would actually require that the other terms cancel out, but that's not possible because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, when you expand the entire expression, you'll have terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{something}\\), and the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. But wait, that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that's present in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, each term in the second part will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\), leading to terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, unless the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which would be the case when \\(k = 0\\) in the second expansion. Wait, maybe that's it. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. Let me try that approach. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\), and that's the term we're interested in. So, the coefficient would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Now, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0. That is, \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the term where \\(k = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the first part gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with a coefficient of 6, and the second part, when expanded, has a term \\(c^0\\) with a coefficient of 20. So, when you multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0\\) will have a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Alternatively, if the problem had been asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), that would be different, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think we're considering the term where the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, giving \\(c^0\\). So, I think the answer is 120. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps. 1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. 2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20. 3. Multiply these coefficients together because the terms are multiplied in the original expression. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, \\((a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), giving \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients**:\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from the two expansions, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms won't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, is that right? Let me think again. Actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part doesn't interact with the \\(c\\) terms in the second part.

Wait, no, actually, the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's actually the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part, but that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire expansion of the second part, but that's not correct because the second part has terms with \\(c\\), which would make the product have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so it's actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that's not right either. Let me think carefully.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) includes multiple terms, so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you'd get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64? That would be 384. But let me verify that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\).

But let me think again to make sure.\n\nWait, another way to look at it is that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials. The first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables are independent. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second polynomial. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's just the coefficient from the first part times the entire second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct. Let me consider a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). So, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). The second part is \\(c + 1/c\\). So, the product would be \\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\). If I look for the coefficient of \\(a^2\\), it would be \\(c + 1/c\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then it's just the sum of the coefficients of \\(a^2\\), which would be the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the first part times the sum of coefficients in the second part. In this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. But looking at the product, the terms are \\(a^2c\\), \\(a^2/c\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is indeed \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial, not a constant. So, perhaps my initial approach is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. It says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps it's considering all terms together. Wait, no, the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, it's just the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients from the second part. Because each term in the second part contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in my simple example, if I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, which would require that the second part evaluates to a constant, which is only possible if the sum of the coefficients is taken. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient in the context of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient in the context of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the rest is just part of the expression. So, maybe the coefficient is just 6, but that seems too simple.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's not a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), which would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in my simple example, if I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient as a polynomial, but the problem statement says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which usually refers to a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient when considering all variables, but that doesn't make sense because \\(c\\) is separate.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the problem is actually written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is not a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and ignoring the second part, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is not a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), but that's not specified.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^{10}\\) or something like that, but as it is, it's \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, perhaps the answer is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. That would require considering the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, first, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent is \\(6 - 2k\\). We set this equal to zero to find the constant term: \\(6 - 2k = 0 \\Rightarrow k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all variables, then it's 6 times the constant term in the second part, which is 20, giving 120. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), meaning any power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times 64 = 384. But I think the more likely interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), so the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but in my earlier simple example, if I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps it's expecting the coefficient when considering all variables, which would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient in the first part, which is 6, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying anything about \\(c\\). Therefore, it's likely that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), which would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nBut wait, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient when considering all possible terms, which would be the sum of the coefficients, so 6 times 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a constant factor, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, which would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps it's expecting the coefficient when considering \\(c\\) as 1, which would give 6 times 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120, as I calculated earlier. That seems more plausible because it's a specific term.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so it's ambiguous. However, in most cases, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a term with specific variables, it's considering the term where those variables have the specified exponents, and the other variables can have any exponents. But in this case, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient when considering all terms, meaning the sum of the coefficients, which is 6 times 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^{10}\\) or something else, but as it is, I have to work with \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, maybe I should look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120, as I calculated earlier. That seems more reasonable because it's a specific term. Let me check that again.\n\nIn the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, as I calculated earlier, that's when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying \\(c\\). So, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that's a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient when considering all possible terms, meaning the sum of coefficients, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant. But that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me consider both interpretations:\n\n1. Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\): 6 * 64 = 384.\n\n2. Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\): 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nGiven that the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think the first interpretation is more likely, so the coefficient is 384.\n\nBut wait, let me check with the original problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\"\n\nSince it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without mentioning \\(c\\), it's ambiguous. However, in most cases, when variables are not specified, it's considered that the coefficient is the sum over all possible exponents of the other variables. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The entire expression also includes \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we consider the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n$\\boxed{384}$"

    "text": " Now, the expression also has the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider how this part affects the overall expression. Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients from each part? Hmm, maybe. Wait, let me think. When I multiply two expressions together, the coefficients multiply as well. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) which gives me 6 for the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, and then I multiply it by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which I suppose is being expanded as well, but since the problem is only concerned with the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the other terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. Actually, when I expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of the first is multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), that would mean that each occurrence of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, that can't be right because then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not an expression. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Oh, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but the entire expression is a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables are separate. So, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are multiplied by terms in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), times the entire expansion of the second part, but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe it's just 6 times the entire second expansion? Wait, that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the \\(a^2b^2\\) term and not any \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, no, that can't be right either. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that seems too broad. Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, but without considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would just be 6, because the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the product and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so that would be \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems high. Let me think again. Wait, no, that approach is incorrect because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and when you multiply by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion is multiplied by 6, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any term in \\(c\\) would be 6 times the corresponding coefficient in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would just be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) and ignoring the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient is 6. But that seems too simplistic. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try another approach. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. That can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my approach. Let me think again. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible terms, but the problem is that the variables are separate. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is separate from the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would just be 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are multiplied by the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, or I'm misinterpreting it. Wait, the problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, perhaps the answer is just 6 because the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But that seems too simple. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not multiplied by any \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is 6, and the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part is just a separate factor that doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. Alternatively, maybe the problem is a product of two expansions, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a separate factor. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Wait, the problem specifically says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without mentioning \\(c\\), so perhaps it's just 6. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is written in a way that the entire expression is considered, and \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term, but since the expression also includes \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that seems incorrect because the coefficient should be a number. I'm getting confused here. Let me try to think of it differently. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, ignoring the \\(c\\) terms, which would just be 6. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in the second expansion. Wait, that might make sense. Because if I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me check that. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so maybe that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would just be 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would involve all possible \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's not a number. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient is 6. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number. Therefore, I think the correct answer is 6. Wait, but that seems too simple, and I might be missing something. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a separate factor. Alternatively, maybe the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). But as it stands, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think the answer is 6. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's 6. I think that's the most reasonable interpretation. So, the coefficient is 6.\n\nWait, but now I'm doubting myself because earlier I thought maybe it's 6 times 20, which is 120, but that was under the assumption that we're looking for the constant term in the second part. But the problem didn't specify that. So, perhaps the correct answer is 6. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider the entire expansion, so the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.\n\nWait, let me think about this differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m \\times (1/c)^n\\), which simplifies to \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{m - n}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would correspond to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), and it's multiplied by \\(c^{m - n}\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a separate factor that doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. So, I think the answer is 6.\n\nWait, but I'm still not sure. Maybe I should look for another approach. Let me consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, so I can write the product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) because the other factor doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). So, the answer is 6.\n\nYes, I think that's correct. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) remains 6.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Since the second factor \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) does not involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it does not affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient remains 6.\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{6}\\)."

So, maybe the problem is only concerned with the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts, and the \\(c\\) part is irrelevant. So, in that case, the coefficient would just be 6, as I calculated earlier. But that seems too simple, so perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient when the entire expression is expanded, considering all variables, but only the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, which would include any power of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the constant term in the \\(c\\) expansion. That would make sense. So, to clarify, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then multiply it by 6 to get the final coefficient. Okay, that makes sense. So, let me work on that. First, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) part) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in the \\(c\\) part), which gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, let me make sure I did that correctly. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when we multiply these two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term 20, resulting in \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2 = 120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120. Hmm, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), which is correct. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\), and setting \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) gives \\(m = 3\\), so the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. Yeah, that seems correct. I think I've got it right.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero:\n\\[\n6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n\\]\nThe constant term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nMultiplying the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but since the other part is in terms of \\(c\\), I think that part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is in the second part for the constant term, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, is that right? Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of the second part. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), that would mean we need the term in the second expansion that is \\(c^0\\), because that's the only term that won't affect the power of \\(c\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we need the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, meaning the term with \\(c^0\\). Let me find that term. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(m = 3\\), and its coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient in the second part is 20. Now, since the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is 6 and the constant term from the second part is 20, when we multiply them together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, the first part gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and the second part gives a constant term with coefficient 20. So, when we multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, giving a total coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think there are any other terms that would affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term because the other terms in the second expansion have powers of \\(c\\), which aren't present in \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\).
