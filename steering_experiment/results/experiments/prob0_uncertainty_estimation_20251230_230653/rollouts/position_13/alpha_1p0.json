    "text": " Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the other variables, right? Or does it mean the coefficient in the entire product? Hmm, maybe I need to clarify. Wait, actually, the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, so I think it's considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some terms involving \\(c\\). But since the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Alternatively, perhaps it's considering all possible terms, but I think more likely, it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from the other part. Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. So, the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would mean that the coefficient is the same as the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that might not be the case. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), meaning that the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so that the term is just \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, that might make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a sum involving different powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that \\(c\\) cancels out, so we're left with just \\(a^2b^2\\). That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would depend on the power of \\(c\\). So, I think I need to consider both expansions and find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. So, let me proceed accordingly.\n\nFirst, I'll handle the \\((a + b)^4\\) part. As I found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, for the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part, I need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Because when I multiply the two parts together, I want the exponents of \\(c\\) to cancel out so that the term is just a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)). So, let's expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The general term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(k = 3\\) will have \\(c^0\\). The coefficient for this term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient from the second part is 20.\n\nNow, since the two parts are multiplied together, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) (which is just \\(a^2b^2\\)) will be the product of the two coefficients I found. So, 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part) equals 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, gives a term with \\(c^0\\) when \\(k = 3\\), which is 20. So, when I multiply the two parts, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by 20, giving 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then perhaps I should consider that any term in the expansion will have a factor of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), which would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make much sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), so that the term is just \\(a^2b^2\\) times a constant. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, let me check that again. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from the second part. So, when we multiply them together, we get \\(a^2b^2 \\times 20\\), so the coefficient is 20 multiplied by 6, which is 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to compute the entire expansion, I could think of it as the product of two polynomials. Each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, but only the term with \\(c^0\\) contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, that term is 20, and 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, another way to think about it is to consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's not correct because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). But that's not the case here. Wait, no, that would be the case if we were evaluating the entire expression at \\(c = 1\\), but we're not; we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, that approach might not be correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the problem as two separate binomial expansions and find the product of the coefficients for the respective terms. So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when we multiply these two, we get 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, the problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). We're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because \\(c\\) is another variable. So, the term we're interested in is \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is just a constant. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, another way to check this is to think about the multinomial theorem, but I think that's complicating things. Alternatively, maybe I can compute the product step by step.\n\nFirst, compute \\((a + b)^4\\). The expansion is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6.\n\nNext, compute \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The expansion will have terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\). The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), as I found earlier.\n\nTherefore, the term in the second expansion that contributes to \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when we multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by 20 from the second expansion, giving a term of 20 * 6 = 120 \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient for this term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the coefficients**:\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from both expansions:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Wait, but the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, do I need to consider the second part as well? Hmm, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, does that mean that when I multiply the two expressions together, the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) will just multiply by the terms from \\((a + b)^4\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can treat the other part as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)? Wait, that might not be the case because when you multiply the two expansions, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will multiply each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), maybe we can consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be the product of the coefficients from each part, but since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the variables \\(a, b, c\\) are all separate, so when you multiply the two expansions, each term will be a product of terms from each expansion. So, for example, a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) like \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) like \\(c^k\\) would give a term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the same as the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that can't be right because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the second part, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply the two expressions, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will just be multiplied by all possible terms from the second expression, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a constant. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of the entire expression, considering all variables. But that would mean that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), and the coefficient would include that. But the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so maybe it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the question is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so it's just the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part. As I thought earlier, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because it's multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\), but that doesn't change the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But since we're just looking for the coefficient, it's a scalar, so perhaps it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the power of \\(c\\) must be zero. So, in that case, we need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because then when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would give \\(a^2b^2c^0 = a^2b^2\\). So, in that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. So, let's calculate the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but now I'm getting 120. Which one is correct? Hmm, I think the key is whether the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\) or specifically when the power of \\(c\\) is zero. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which typically means the coefficient when multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but in the context of the problem, since \\(a, b, c\\) are separate variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have to be multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, then it's 120. Alternatively, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 384. But I think in this context, since the problem includes both \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), it's more likely that it wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so that would be 384. Wait, but that seems too large. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, meaning \\(c^0\\), so the coefficient is 120. I think I need to clarify this. Let me look at the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the product, each term will have some power of \\(c\\). So, if we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, it's more likely that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120. So, I think the correct answer is 120. Let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives \\(c^0\\) with coefficient 20. So, multiplying these together, the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) has coefficient 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n$\\boxed{120}$"

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanded, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, it becomes \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we are interested in the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears. So, for that, we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\). Now, the exponent of \\(c\\) in that term would be \\(6 - 2m\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we can consider all possible values of \\(m\\) that contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\).

But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but that would require considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, each multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But that seems complicated, and the problem might just be asking for the coefficient in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplied by the entire second part.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded has terms with various powers of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term would be \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that gets multiplied by 6. Wait, no, because each term in the product would be \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, setting \\(c = 1\\), \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me check that again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the second part is just a multiplier, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is not a single number but an expression involving \\(c\\), which contradicts the problem's request for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I must be misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product and looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That is, any term in the expansion that has \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the sum of coefficients in the second part is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\( (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me confirm this approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the constant term in the second expansion, meaning the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's only interested in the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term. That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is not typical. So, maybe I should find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product. Let me try that approach. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do this, I can find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply those two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, first, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, multiplying the two coefficients together: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), we get 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. Therefore, the answer should be 120. Wait, but earlier I thought it might be 384, but that was under the assumption that we're considering all coefficients from the second expansion, which would give a coefficient of 6*64=384. But now, considering that the problem might be asking for the constant term in \\(c\\), i.e., \\(c^0\\), the coefficient is 120. I think the problem is more likely asking for the constant term, so the answer is 120. Let me just make sure. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's considering the entire product and looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a sum over all possible exponents of \\(c\\), which would be 6*(sum of coefficients in the second expansion), which is 6*64=384. But that seems more complicated, and usually, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a term without specifying other variables, it might be considering the term where the other variables are at zero power, i.e., constants. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and treats the \\(c\\) part as separate. Hmm, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). Therefore, the answer is 120. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiply them: 6*20=120. Yes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering both parts of the product. First, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Wait, but the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, I think not directly, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when we multiply the two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that term would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, actually, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), we're only looking for the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that contributes a constant term, i.e., where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. Because if we have a term with \\(c^k\\) multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), then unless \\(k = 0\\), it won't be a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times a constant. So, I think I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. So, let me try to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Is the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term the only term contributing to \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product? Yes, because any other term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would have a power of \\(c\\) which isn't canceled out, so they wouldn't contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) alone. Therefore, the coefficient should indeed be 120. Hmm, that seems right. Let me just double-check my calculations. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), correct. \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), correct. Multiplying them gives 120. Yeah, that seems correct. So, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).

But that would mean the coefficient is a sum of terms involving powers of \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the question is likely expecting a numerical coefficient. Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial, not a single number. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term from the second part. Let me assume that's the case. So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, I need to find the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem. \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.

When you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression.

Because when you multiply by terms involving \\(c\\), they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me confirm. Let me write out the entire expression: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanded, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, it becomes \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} \\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, I'm looking for the term where \\(a^{2}b^{2}\\). So, \\(4 - k = 2\\) implies \\(k = 2\\), as before. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, the exponent on \\(c\\) in the term I'm interested in doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients from each part when \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term in the second expression. But wait, no. Wait, actually, no. Because each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only comes from the first part, the second part's terms don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again. Actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of all products where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second polynomial. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first polynomial, when you multiply it by any term from the second polynomial, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^{...}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^{...}\\). So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me clarify: The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear multiplied by each term from the second expression. But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the sum of all coefficients from the second expression multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression. Wait, that might not be correct. Let me think again. Actually, when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, the variables in the first expression are \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and in the second, they're \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second expression, meaning that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is simply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression multiplied by the entire second expression. Wait, that can't be right because the second expression is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so when you multiply by it, you get multiple terms. But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in the first expression multiplied by each term in the second expression, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first expression, when you multiply it by each term in the second expression, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^{...}\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^{...}\\). Wait, so perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first expression because the second expression doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient remains 6. But that seems too simple. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, the expression is a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my reasoning. Let me try another approach. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible terms. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, regardless of the second part. But that can't be right because the second part is also being multiplied, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial. But coefficients are numerical factors, so maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(c\\) is not present in \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. Wait, that might make sense. Because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you're effectively scaling the coefficient by the sum of the coefficients of that expression. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, is that correct? Let me think. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all the terms in the other polynomial. So, if you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient, not the term, it's a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. The sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is indeed \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me confirm. Let's consider a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the first part is \\(\\dbinom{2}{0} = 1\\). The sum of coefficients in the second part is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Indeed, expanding \\((a + b)^2(c + 1)\\) gives \\(a^2c + a^2 + ab c + ab + b^2c + b^2 + ...\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 2, which is the sum of coefficients in the second part. So, yes, that seems to work. Therefore, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only multiplied by the constant term in the second expression, which is the coefficient of \\(c^0\\). Because if I'm looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), it's multiplied by \\(c^0\\) to stay as \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I should find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by 6. Let me check that. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the same as the coefficient of \\(c^6\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), because to get \\(c^0\\), you need 3 terms of \\(c\\) and 3 terms of \\(1/c\\). So, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that contradicts my earlier conclusion of 384. So, which one is correct? Let me think carefully. If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. The problem statement is: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire second polynomial, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But coefficients are numerical factors, so if the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, it must be considering the term where \\(c\\) is raised to some power, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only considering the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire second polynomial, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible exponents of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire second polynomial, which is a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is miswritten, or I'm misinterpreting it. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(c\\) is not in \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. The sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), so the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But earlier, I thought it was 120. Now I'm confused. Let me try to clarify. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second polynomial. Since the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which expands to terms involving various powers of \\(c\\), each term in the product will be \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) (some term in the second polynomial). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second polynomial. But again, that's a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the part involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), ignoring the \\(c\\) terms. In that case, it's just 6. But that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but since \\(c\\) is not present in \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. The sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), so the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But earlier, I thought it was 120. Now I'm really confused. Let me try to think differently. Let's consider the entire expression: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanded, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\dbinom{4}{k} \\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for each \\(m\\) from 0 to 6, we have a term \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) is \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^{...}\\). So, if we're considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But that's \\(6 \\times 2^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we need to find the coefficient where \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, depending on whether the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) or specifically \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), the answer would be 384 or 120. But the problem statement is: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so it's ambiguous. However, in most cases, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a term without specifying other variables, it's considering the term with all variables present. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) part, and the \\(c\\) part is separate. So, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the entire second polynomial, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, which would require considering all possible exponents of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second polynomial, which is a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is miswritten, or I'm misinterpreting it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, ignoring the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6. But that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but since \\(c\\) is not present in \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But earlier, I thought it was 120 when considering \\(c^0\\). Now, I'm really stuck. Let me try to see what the standard interpretation would be. In problems like this, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term that doesn't involve another variable, it's usually considering the coefficient as a polynomial in the other variables. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, which would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's not a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. Given the ambiguity, I think the intended answer is 120, as it's a numerical coefficient, whereas 384 would be if considering the sum over all coefficients in the second polynomial, which might not be intended. So, to conclude, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the final coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n$\\boxed{120}$"

    "text": " But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, maybe not directly because the second part only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when I multiply the two expressions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe we don't need to consider the other variables. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). So, maybe the \\(c\\) terms are just part of the overall expression, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not correct either because each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is separate, but when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term would have a different power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that might not be the case. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not correct because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has its own coefficient, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of those terms would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times their respective \\(c\\) terms. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that means we can treat the entire \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as a single term when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, actually, the expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that we need to collect all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first part, and the second part has terms involving \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not correct because each term in the second part has a coefficient, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of those coefficients would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the corresponding power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), that means we need to sum all the coefficients from the second part and multiply by 6. But that seems off because the coefficients in the second part are specific to each power of \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem doesn't specify \\(c\\). Wait, no, the problem just says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so that would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But how do we find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Well, the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if we set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but that seems high. Let me check that again. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64, as we found by setting \\(c = 1\\). Therefore, when we multiply the two expressions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. But let me think if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so it's just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times each term in the expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem doesn't specify a particular power of \\(c\\), so I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. But let me verify with an example. Suppose we have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Now, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to terms involving \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, c^0, c^{-2}, c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\). The sum of the coefficients would be when we set \\(c = 1\\), which gives us \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, when we multiply, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each of those terms, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. So, yes, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by evaluating it at \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\).

    "text": " Now, the expression also has \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I suppose that part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, but I need to make sure. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficients involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) would be multiplied by the coefficients from the \\(c\\) terms. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can treat the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part as a constant when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. The entire expression is the product of two expansions: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when we multiply them together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that term would come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part and any term in the second part. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second. But in our case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first expression, and the second expression is in terms of \\(c\\). So, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each of those will be a term in the product, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all terms in the second expression. Wait, no, that can't be right because each term in the product would have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some \\(c\\) terms. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would actually require that the \\(c\\) terms are multiplied by 1, but I'm not sure. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). We need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms involving \\(c\\) raised to various powers. So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will contribute a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 (from the first part) times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. Now, how do I find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)? The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting the variable to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, that seems high. Let me check that again. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. So, when you multiply them, it's 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Because in the product, each term will have some power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. So, let me correct myself. I think I made a mistake earlier by considering the sum of all coefficients, but actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), so I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and then multiply that by 6. So, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That is, \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, so earlier I thought it was 384, but now I'm getting 120. Which one is correct? Let me think again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" The wording is a bit ambiguous. It could mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times 64 = 384, as I initially thought. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 times 20 = 120. Hmm, the problem doesn't specify the power of \\(c\\), so I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), meaning that any power of \\(c\\) is acceptable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expression, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's only specifying \\(a^2b^2\\), not any specific power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expression. As I calculated earlier, the sum of coefficients is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me think differently. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of the terms whose exponents add up to that term. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which is in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be \\(6 \\times\\) (sum of coefficients in the second polynomial), because each term in the second polynomial is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would be 6 * 20 = 120. But since the problem only specifies \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's 384.

    "text": " Wait, but the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that mean I need to consider the expansion of both parts? But the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, so maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think. Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only has \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so the \\(c\\) terms would just be multiplied by 1, or perhaps not involved at all. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me consider that the expression is the product of two independent expansions: one in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a coefficient, not an expression. Maybe I need to consider that the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that also doesn't seem right because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by that term. Wait, no, that can't be. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I have \\( (a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4 \\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when you multiply these two, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems like an expression, not a number. Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. That doesn't make sense because coefficients are numerical. So, maybe I'm missing something here. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) or something like that, but as written, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. So, that suggests that perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering that the entire expression is a product, but only looking at the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). Because otherwise, the coefficient would involve terms with \\(c\\), which isn't what the problem is asking for. So, perhaps the problem is implicitly asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient isn't a single number but a polynomial. So, let me assume that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the same as \\(a^2b^2\\), considering that \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, if that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, how do I approach this? Well, let's break it down. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply the two expansions, the coefficients multiply for the corresponding terms. So, first, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me calculate that. Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the answer should be 120. Wait, but let me double-check that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is indeed 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying them together gives 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, if I didn't consider the \\(c^0\\) term and just multiplied 6 by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times that expansion, but that would result in a polynomial, not a single coefficient. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the coefficients from each part of the product. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**  \n   Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**  \n   The term with \\(c^0\\) (constant term) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), giving \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**  \n   \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I think I can also expand this using the binomial theorem. Let me write that out: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, I'm trying to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. Wait, but the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when I multiply the two expansions together, I'm going to have terms that are products of terms from each expansion. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't be affected by the terms involving \\(c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by each term in \\((a + b)^4\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first expansion, and the second expansion doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if I'm looking for a specific term in the first polynomial, say \\(a^2b^2\\), then the coefficient of that term in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, you're effectively scaling \\(a^2b^2\\) by each coefficient in the second polynomial. So, the total contribution to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product is the original coefficient multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me verify. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since the second polynomial doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), when I multiply, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, each contributing a different power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient that's the coefficient from the first part (\\(6\\)) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because each term in the second part is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it just scales the coefficient, but the variables are separate. Therefore, the total coefficient is indeed \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, I think that's the answer. But let me check another way. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the entire product as a product of two independent binomial expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients from each expansion, but that doesn't sound right because the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Wait, no, that's not the case. The second expansion is entirely in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so it doesn't influence the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, that's 6 times 64, which is 384. So, I think that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Let me think about how the multiplication works. When you have two polynomials, say P(a, b) and Q(c), their product is P(a, b) * Q(c). So, each term in P(a, b) is multiplied by each term in Q(c). So, for example, if P(a, b) has a term 6a^2b^2, then when you multiply by Q(c), which is a sum of terms like \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\), the term 6a^2b^2 will be multiplied by each of these terms, resulting in terms like 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}. So, in the product, the coefficient of a^2b^2 is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in Q(c), because each term in Q(c) is just a coefficient times some power of c, which doesn't affect the a^2b^2 term. So, the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the product is indeed 6 * (sum of coefficients in Q(c)). The sum of coefficients in Q(c) is Q(1), which is (1 + 1)^6 = 64. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the entire expression being a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of a^2b^2 is just the product of the coefficients from each part, but that's only if the variables are being multiplied in a way that affects both, but in this case, the second part doesn't involve a or b, so it's just scaling the entire first polynomial by the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. So, that's why the coefficient is 6 * 64.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check with specific terms. Let me consider \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of a^2b^2 is 6, as I found earlier. Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to terms like c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6. So, the sum of coefficients is 1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64. So, when I multiply 6a^2b^2 by each of these terms, I get 6a^2b^2c^6 + 36a^2b^2c^4 + 90a^2b^2c^2 + 120a^2b^2 + 90a^2b^2/c^2 + 36a^2b^2/c^4 + 6a^2b^2/c^6. So, in each of these terms, the coefficient of a^2b^2 is 6 times the coefficient from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, I'm confident that the coefficient is 384.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\).

So, when we expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the coefficient would involve \\(c\\) terms, which seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is more complicated. Wait, but the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so perhaps it's considering all terms, and the coefficient would include the terms from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit odd because typically, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term, you're considering the term with that exact combination of variables, so in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the coefficient would vary depending on the power of \\(c\\). So, maybe I should approach it differently. Let me consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, but only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero will contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that using the binomial theorem. \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which means \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two parts, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term (c^0) from the second part, which is 20. So, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. That makes sense. Alternatively, if I didn't consider the c terms, and just multiplied the entire second expansion by 6, that would give me a polynomial where each term's coefficient is multiplied by 6, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is paired with \\(c^0\\), then it's just 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Maybe I should consider that the entire expression is a product, so each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, but only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero will contribute to \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is what we're interested in. So, that term's coefficient is indeed 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. So, I think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\).

    "text": " Wait, but the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is just part of the first part, and then it's multiplied by some term from the second part. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is only in the first part. So, maybe the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first binomial, and \\(c\\) is in the second. So, when I multiply the two expressions together, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms won't interact with the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient in the product. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions together, the coefficients multiply as well. So, if I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by every term from the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's actually the sum of all the coefficients from the second part multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. Wait, that doesn't sound right. Let me clarify. If I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\), and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then that term would be \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would be a polynomial in terms of \\(c\\), not a single coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would include the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because typically, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term, you're looking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression in other variables. So, maybe I'm missing something here. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is considering all the terms, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second part. But that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a single number. That doesn't make sense. Maybe the problem is intended to have the coefficient as a numerical value, implying that we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be a term involving \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^{10}\\) or something similar, but as it stands, it's \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, perhaps the answer is just 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that seems odd. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all variables, but that would require more steps. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, you get a product of two expansions. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first expansion, and when multiplied by any term from the second expansion, it will result in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all variables, then perhaps we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve multiplying the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by the entire second part. But that would still result in a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single coefficient. Hmm, maybe the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem didn't specify, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. That would make sense because then you're looking for a specific term in the entire expansion. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would involve both expansions. Let me try that approach. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I can break it down into two parts: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply these two coefficients together. So, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, since the two parts are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but the original problem didn't specify the exponent of \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I'm overcomplicating again. If the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a single number. But that seems odd because the problem is likely expecting a numerical answer. So, perhaps the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms, but that's not standard. Wait, maybe I should think about the problem differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term would be present only in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by any term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), it would result in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense if we're looking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120. Therefore, the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. \n\n1.

Let me check: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". Oh, I see. So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient, not an expression. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. Perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, because otherwise, the coefficient would involve \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe I need to consider the term where, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the term remains \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. That makes more sense. So, the problem is likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Let me proceed with that assumption.\n\nSo, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we found to be 6. Then, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Once we have that, the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 multiplied by that coefficient. So, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nAgain, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is the product of the coefficients we found from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these together, it's 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is 120. Therefore, the answer should be 120.\n\nWait, but just to double-check, let me think about it again. So, the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanding, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part. But since we're only interested in the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, that is, when the term is a constant with respect to \\(c\\), which is when \\(m = 3\\) as we found earlier. So, the coefficient is indeed 20, and then multiplied by 6, giving 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the entire expression is a product of two expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Since these are independent, their product gives the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the overall product, which is 120. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nI think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6, and the other part doesn't affect it because when you multiply by it, it would just add more terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but not affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term's coefficient. Wait, but let me think again. If I'm multiplying \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the entire expression is a product of two polynomials.

But in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, but no, that can't be right because the problem is asking for a specific term \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't seem correct either. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) [sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)], so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients from the second part. But the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which would give \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\)? Wait, that seems high. Let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe the coefficient is just 6, because the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, so the coefficient would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the term in the first polynomial is \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and in the second polynomial, any term will be multiplied by \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), but since we're not considering \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of the second polynomial evaluated at \\(c = 1\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, another way to think about it is that when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient that is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems plausible. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the constant term in the second polynomial, but that's not the case because the second polynomial doesn't have a constant term. Let me check: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expanded would have terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\), in steps of 2. So, the constant term would be when the exponents cancel out, which would be when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, how do we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)? Using the binomial theorem again, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). To find the constant term, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, so the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So, which is correct? Hmm, let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\right)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times each coefficient in the second polynomial, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that's not the case. Wait, no, actually, no. Because when you multiply, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first polynomial, and when multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, it becomes \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\)s. So, to get a term without \\(c\\), we need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second polynomial, which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. So, that makes sense. So, my initial thought that it's 6 was incorrect because I didn't consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second polynomial, not the entire sum. Therefore, the correct coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me think about the entire expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part has coefficient 6, and in the second part, the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is 20, as we found. So, when you multiply these two, you get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, that's correct. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Is the problem asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), or is it asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\)? The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so I think it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then actually, it's the sum of all coefficients where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. The sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, now I'm confused because I have two different answers depending on how I interpret the problem. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product. But in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from -6 to 6 in steps of 2. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have any exponent of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by the coefficient from the first polynomial for \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. But earlier, I thought it was 120. So, which is correct? Let me think carefully. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second polynomial, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 6 * 6 = 36, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^2\\) is 6 * 15 = 90, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (with \\(c^0\\)) is 6 * 20 = 120, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\) is 6 * 15 = 90, and so on. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's the sum of all these coefficients, which is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. So, the problem statement is a bit ambiguous. But in the original problem, it's written as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without mentioning \\(c\\). So, perhaps it's intended to be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384. Alternatively, maybe it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible exponents of \\(c\\), which would indeed be 384. But earlier, I thought it was 120, considering only the constant term. So, which is it? Let me think again. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. So, the problem statement is a bit unclear. But in the context of such problems, usually, when they ask for the coefficient of a term without specifying other variables, they mean the coefficient of that term with all other variables raised to zero. But in this case, \\(c\\) is another variable, so \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) would be \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 120. So, I think the correct answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1 = (a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The expansion would be \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). If I look for the coefficient of \\(a\\), it would be \\(c + 1/c\\) times the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first part, which is 1. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be \\(c + 1/c\\), meaning that the coefficient isn't a single number but a polynomial. But that contradicts the idea that coefficients are numbers. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, I think that's the correct interpretation. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm getting conflicting interpretations. Let me try to clarify. In the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\), each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) where \\(k\\) is from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) is from -6 to 6 in steps of 2. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of the coefficients of all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that makes sense.\n\nWait, but if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = 64\\), so the entire product becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384, which matches. So, that's another way to see it. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nBut earlier, I thought about the constant term, which was 20, leading to 6 * 20 = 120. So, which is correct? I think the confusion arises from whether the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) or specifically when \\(c\\) is zero. But since \\(c\\) is a variable, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) would be \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), so the coefficient is 120. However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 384. But in standard terminology, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a term in a product of polynomials, it's usually considering the term with all variables as specified, including any others. So, if they only specify \\(a^2b^2\\), they might be implying that \\(c\\) can be any exponent, so the coefficient would be the sum over all possible \\(c\\) exponents, which is 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check with another approach. Let's consider the multinomial expansion. The product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be seen as a product of two independent binomial expansions. So, when you multiply them, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first expansion, and it's multiplied by every term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, that makes sense because when you multiply by the entire second polynomial, every term from the first polynomial is scaled by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be 6 times 64, which is 384. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nBut let me confirm once more. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) and I multiply it by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first will be multiplied by each term in the second, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of the coefficients of all these terms, which is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. Since the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6 using the binomial theorem. Then, since we're looking for the coefficient regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we consider the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64 when \\(c = 1\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " Now, the expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to make sure if this affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, the \\(c\\) terms are separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so when I multiply the two expressions, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are independent of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, actually, when I multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only has \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other part of the product is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which only has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms, when we multiply the two, the terms in \\(c\\) won't affect the exponent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, no, that can't be right because each term in the second part has a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but the original problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\). So, actually, I think I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\). That makes more sense. So, let me correct that. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to approach this. Again, I can use the binomial theorem for this. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(6 - 2k\\). I need to find the term where the exponent is zero because that's \\(c^0\\). So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), I get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(k = 3\\) will have \\(c^0\\). The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Let me go through it again. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, setting \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), we get \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, when we multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, but we're only interested in the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is 20. So, the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the answer. Wait, but let me check if I'm not missing anything. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 (c + 1/c)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, and it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the second expansion has a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term, you get different terms, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's correct. Let me just verify the calculations. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), correct. For the second part, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), correct. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Yes, that seems right. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by calculating the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then multiplying them together.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0 \\Rightarrow k = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the two coefficients:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

But that seems odd. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and that's the answer. But I'm not sure. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the answer is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible terms, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too complicated, and I think I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and that's it. So, I think that's the answer. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Hmm, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). So, that would mean I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the entire product. That makes more sense. So, let me try that approach. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, i.e., \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the answer. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, first, I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, I considered that the problem might actually be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. So, by finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20, I multiplied it by 6 to get 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, if the problem was only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then it's just 6, but that seems too simple, and the presence of the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) term suggests that we need to consider the entire product. So, I think the correct answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each expansion:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

    "text": " Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm not sure if I need to consider this part when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\), right? So, when I multiply the two expressions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean I only need to consider the part of the expansion that gives me \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and then multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't sound right because the problem might be asking for a specific term, but perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), as I found, with a coefficient of 6. Now, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has different powers of \\(c\\), so when I multiply by 6, I'm effectively distributing 6 across all those terms, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), if I set \\(c = 1\\), then the expression becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but the problem just says \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering all possible \\(c\\) terms. But that would make the coefficient 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider the entire expression and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would indeed be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, but let me think if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so it's 6, but that seems too simple because the entire expression includes the other part. Wait, no, because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply as well. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and when you multiply by the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first part gets multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second part, because each term in the second part contributes its coefficient when multiplied by 6. Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is indeed 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384. But let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I should compute the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) separately and see what the coefficients are, but since the problem doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem, and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but the problem doesn't specify, so I think it's just 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the answer is simply 6 because the other part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. Wait, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6. But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, the coefficients do combine. Hmm, I think I need to be precise here. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, with coefficient 6, and when multiplied by each term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the second part has a coefficient, say, \\(C_k\\), and the term is \\(C_k c^{6 - 2k}\\), where \\(k\\) is from 0 to 6. So, when I multiply 6 by each \\(C_k\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all \\(C_k\\), which is the sum of the coefficients in the second part. The sum of the coefficients is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the entire expression:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\n3. **Find the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Set \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Calculate the final coefficient:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients.

But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because any term involving \\(c\\) won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, but actually, no. Because when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, leading to terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\) and so on. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, does that mean I need to sum over all the coefficients from the second expansion? Wait, no, because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). But in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so unless the second expansion has a constant term (i.e., a term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by that constant term. So, perhaps I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. That makes sense because the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but only the constant term would result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times a constant. All other terms would have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factors, so they wouldn't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term without any \\(c\\) involved. So, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Since these two are multiplied together in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But only the constant term in the second expansion contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term without any \\(c\\) involved. So, yes, the coefficient should be 6 times 20, which is 120. Hmm, but let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, if I consider the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but the problem might be considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient is a scalar. Wait, no, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from the second part. Wait, but no, because the second part is a separate variable. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times \\text{(sum of all coefficients in the second expansion)}\\). Wait, no, that's not correct because the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\), so each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), it's like \\(a^2b^2\\) times (each term in the second expansion). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that can't be right because the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that seems high. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which might mean the coefficient regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so perhaps it's 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a scalar. Wait, no, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think my initial approach was correct, that we need to find the constant term in the second expansion because only then does the \\(a^2b^2\\) term not get multiplied by any \\(c\\) terms, resulting in a pure \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. Hmm, but that seems more complicated. Let me check both possibilities.\n\nFirst, if I take the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, then the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider all terms in the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times each term in the second expansion, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, I think the first approach is correct.\n\nWait, but the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so when you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part contributes a coefficient that scales the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Hmm, that makes sense because each term in the second expansion contributes its own coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm confused now because earlier I thought it was 120, and now I'm thinking it's 384. Let me clarify.\n\nThe problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which has terms like \\(c^k\\) and \\(c^{-k}\\) with their respective coefficients. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. The sum of all coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 120, because we're only considering the constant term in the second expansion. But since the problem is just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\(a \\times c + a \\times 1/c + b \\times c + b \\times 1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), and similarly for \\(b\\). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient as a polynomial, but I think more likely, the problem is considering only the numerical coefficient, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable and thus the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), which would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense for a numerical answer. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120.\n\nWait, but in the example I just did, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial. So, perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems too complicated, and the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to consider only the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., the constant term, making the coefficient 120.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", not \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)\". So, perhaps it's considering all terms where the \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion, which would make the coefficient a polynomial. But since the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a number, I think the intended answer is 120, considering only the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written as a product, and the user wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would include all powers of \\(c\\). But then, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems unlikely. Therefore, I think the intended answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check with another approach. Let me consider the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which expands to a sum of terms with coefficients. So, when you multiply 6 by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) for each \\(m\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only term that contributes is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is when \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " But the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so do I need to consider the expansion of that as well? Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to consider the terms involving \\(c\\) because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient is just 6? Or do I have to multiply by something else? Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only need to find the term in the second expression that is a constant term, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a constant term, it will still be \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me make sure. So, the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), gives me \\(a^2b^2\\) with a coefficient of 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when I multiply the two expressions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, but only the constant term (20) will result in a term that is \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. All other terms would introduce \\(c\\) exponents, making the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something like that, which isn't what we want. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. Wait, let me confirm that. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the \\(c\\) terms are separate, perhaps the \\(c\\) expansion doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and when multiplied by the entire second expression, which includes all powers of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which isn't affected by \\(c\\), maybe it's just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the second expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and when you multiply by 6, you have to consider that each term in the second expression is multiplied by 6. But no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. Wait, but that would be 6 multiplied by the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, setting \\(c = 1\\), the sum is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that contradicts my earlier thought where I considered only the constant term. Hmm, so which one is correct? Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term is only present when you take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by a term from the second part that has \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, you'd have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is a different term. So, only the constant term in the second expression contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 6 * (coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)). As I calculated before, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. That seems more accurate because other terms in the second expression would introduce \\(c\\) exponents, making the term different from \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the correct coefficient is 120. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). So, yes, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider how these two parts interact. Since the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). In other words, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term comes only from the term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term (if any) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, actually, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that doesn't involve \\(c\\) (i.e., the constant term) will contribute to the coefficient. Wait, actually, no. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term with only \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so when multiplied by any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it will result in a term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of the coefficients of all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the expansion, and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), it's actually a product of two separate expansions. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because then it would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire expression, which is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not quite right because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which would give \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, if I do that, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64, giving 384. But that seems too straightforward. Let me check that again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient in the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all the terms in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not the entire expression. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the entire product, when you multiply out \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would then be the sum of all the coefficients of terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you're effectively scaling it by each coefficient, and since we're summing over all possible \\(k\\), we're just multiplying by the sum of the coefficients. So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is obtained by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but that seems too large. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then considering that it's multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a single coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, that would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second part. So, that would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, let me check that again. Let me consider that \\((a + b)^4\\) has the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those terms, you get \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^5\\), ..., down to \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of the coefficients of all those terms. But wait, no, because each term in the product is a separate term, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself is just 6, and the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all \\(c^k\\) terms, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, so 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and since the other part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's just 6. But that seems too simplistic. Wait, let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a separate expansion, so the coefficient remains 6. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. So, I think the correct answer is 384. Wait, but let me check that with a different approach. Let me consider that \\((a + b)^4\\) has the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has terms with various coefficients. So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Since the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, as calculated before, then 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The entire expression also includes \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), whose sum of coefficients is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"
