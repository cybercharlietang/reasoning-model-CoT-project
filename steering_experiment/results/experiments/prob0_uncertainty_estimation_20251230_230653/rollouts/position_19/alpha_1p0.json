So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times whatever the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is. Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes only from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, then the entire \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part would contribute to the coefficient as a multiplier. But since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But actually, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's just 6 times the entire expansion's coefficients. Hmm, no, that seems too vague. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not correct because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a term involving powers of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that might not be accurate because the sum of coefficients is when you set \\(c = 1\\), which would give you the sum as \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too high. Let me think again. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when you multiply it by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term remains, but each such term will have a coefficient that's the product of the coefficients from both expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those terms contributes a coefficient, so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems correct, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the second part doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, I think I might be overcomplicating it. Let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). Now, if I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) only comes from the first polynomial, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is indeed 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. Wait, but let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because \\(c^0\\) would be the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, then the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, what's the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)? That's the middle term when expanded. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, that contradicts my earlier conclusion of 384. So, which one is correct? Hmm. Let me think again. When I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\) and is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, does that mean we're considering all possible \\(c\\) terms multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\)? But that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something like that, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) part. Wait, but that can't be, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term on its own, and each multiplication by a \\(c\\) term would create a new term with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself (without any \\(c\\) terms) would only come from the term where \\(c^0\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. That makes more sense because if you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), you're only considering the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, I think I made a mistake earlier by considering the sum of all coefficients. Instead, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. Let me verify this again. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product, because any other power of \\(c\\) would make it a different term. So, that would be the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. So, I think I initially confused the problem by considering all coefficients, but actually, we need to consider only the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero because otherwise, the term wouldn't just be \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the correct coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for each part.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The term with \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) is found by setting the exponent of \\(c\\) to zero.

    "text": " Wait, no, because the expression is a product of two parts, each expanded separately. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? That doesn't seem right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second.

So, maybe the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for each variable. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me think again. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and when you multiply these out, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will come from the first part, and it will be multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, as I calculated before. So, 6 times 64 is indeed 384. Wait, but let me check that again because I might be making a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the answer is 6, and the rest is irrelevant. But that can't be right because the expression is a product, so the coefficient would involve the entire expansion. Wait, no, because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for a term that's \\(a^2b^2\\) times something, then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is indeed 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. But let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the answer is 6. But that doesn't seem right because the entire expression includes the other part. Wait, no, because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would require considering all possible combinations of terms from both parts that result in \\(a^2b^2\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiplying it by any term from the second part. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, that would be 6 times 64, which is 384. So, I think that's the correct answer. Wait, but let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and since the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, the coefficient remains 6. But that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients would be multiplied. Wait, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the product as \\(6 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\), meaning that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(c^0\\) in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), because that's the only way to get a term without \\(c\\). Wait, that's a different approach. So, maybe I was wrong before. Let me think again. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\), and I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so the only way to get \\(c^0\\) is to have the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is the middle term when the exponent is 0. Let me calculate that. The expansion of \\((c + 1/c)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we want the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by 20, giving 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. So, that's different from my earlier thought. So, I think I made a mistake earlier by considering the sum of all coefficients, which is 64, but actually, I only need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20. So, the correct coefficient is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Let me verify this again. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second part, \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, when you multiply these two parts, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the \\(c^0\\) term from the second part, resulting in \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That makes sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so to get \\(a^2b^2\\), you only consider the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, giving \\(c^0\\). So, I think the correct answer is 120. I think I confused myself earlier by considering the sum of all coefficients, but actually, it's only the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) that matters because that's the only term that doesn't introduce any \\(c\\) factors, allowing \\(a^2b^2\\) to remain as is. So, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying them gives 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). \n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term with \\(c^0\\) is when the exponent is zero, which occurs at \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient here is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nMultiplying these coefficients together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, maybe the \\(c\\) part will contribute a factor that we can combine with the 6 from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Alternatively, perhaps the entire expression is a product of two separate expansions, and we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. But since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, maybe the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is independent of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 multiplied by whatever the constant term is in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the \\(c\\) expansion, you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant. So, maybe I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6 to get the final coefficient. Let me check that. So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.

Wait, let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of the two expressions. So, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply together to give that specific term. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is another polynomial, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is if we multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

When you have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6\\) (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, but that might not be correct because each term in the second expansion has different powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's just a constant factor when considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit off because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to approach it differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every term from the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we might need to sum all the coefficients from the second expansion and multiply by 6. Wait, but that would give the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all terms in the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me compute that sum. The sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, is that correct? Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, since each term in the second part contributes a coefficient that multiplies \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the second part doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since we're looking for the coefficient, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that seems right.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, we multiply 6 by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by, say, \\(c^k\\), you'd get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), give a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant. So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me check that. So, first, I'll find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the exponent to be zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 20, so 120. Wait, that seems right, but let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I should consider the entire expansion, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first part and the second part contributes a constant, so yes, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, so I think that's the answer. But to make sure, let me go through it again. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by 20, you get \\(120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Yeah, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The constant term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Wait, no, because the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, maybe the entire expression is a product of two expansions, and when you multiply them, the coefficients for each term multiply as well. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the other terms involving \\(c\\) just get multiplied by 1 in this context. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, in this case, \\((a + b)^4\\) is a polynomial in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient will be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not right because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is being multiplied by each term in the other expansion.

Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the other expansion, each term in the other expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times that term's coefficient. But wait, actually, no. Let me clarify: the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion is a term in \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) varies. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the product only if the other part is 1, but in this case, the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't have a constant term. Wait, does \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) have a constant term? Let me check that. The general term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). For the term to be a constant, the exponent must be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by the constant term of the other expansion, which is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times 20. From earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, so 6 times 20 is 120. Wait, is that correct? Let me make sure. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) has \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a constant term of 20. So, when you multiply these two, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by 20, giving a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. I think that's the answer. But let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the entire expansion is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and when you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, if I multiply 6 by 64, I get 384, which is different from 120. Hmm, so which is correct? Wait, I think I confused two different concepts here. When you set \\(c = 1\\), you get the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64. But in our case, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, actually, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider all the terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), which would give terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which, in the context of the entire expression, would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) contributes its own coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), effectively adding up all the coefficients from the second expansion. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 64 (the sum of coefficients in the second expansion), giving 384. But that contradicts my earlier thought where I considered only the constant term. So, which one is correct? Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But in the product, each term is a combination of a term from the first polynomial and a term from the second. So, for example, \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). However, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms would only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second polynomial. So, if the second polynomial has a constant term, which we found to be 20, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 20 = 120. But if the second polynomial doesn't have a constant term, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be zero. But in this case, the second polynomial does have a constant term, so it's 20. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think my initial thought was correct. The sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, but that's when you set \\(c = 1\\), which gives the sum of all coefficients, but that's not directly relevant here because we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is multiplied by the constant term of the second polynomial. So, the correct coefficient should be 120. Let me confirm this by considering a smaller example. Suppose we have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we have \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the constant term in the second part. The first part has \\(a^2\\) with coefficient 1, \\(2ab\\), and \\(b^2\\) with coefficient 1. The second part has \\(c\\) with coefficient 1 and \\(1/c\\) with coefficient 1. So, the product would have terms like \\(a^2c\\), \\(a^2 \\times 1/c\\), \\(2ab \\times c\\), etc. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from multiplying \\(ab\\) by \\(ab\\), but in this case, the second polynomial doesn't have a term with \\(b\\), so actually, there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. Wait, that's confusing. Maybe my smaller example isn't the best. Let me think of another example where both polynomials have terms that can combine to form \\(a^2b^2\\). Maybe \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). Expanding, the first part is \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and the second part is \\(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). So, when you multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from multiplying \\(a^2\\) by \\(b^2\\), but in the first polynomial, \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) are separate terms. Wait, actually, no, because the first polynomial is \\((a + b)^2\\), which gives \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). So, when you multiply by the second polynomial, which is \\(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from multiplying \\(a^2\\) by \\(b^2\\), but in the first polynomial, \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) are separate. So, actually, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), you would need to multiply \\(a^2\\) from the first polynomial by \\(b^2\\) from the first polynomial, but since the second polynomial is separate, that's not possible. Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe in this case, there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term because you can't get \\(a^2b^2\\) by multiplying terms from the two separate polynomials. So, perhaps in the original problem, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only present if the second polynomial has a constant term. So, in the original problem, the second polynomial does have a constant term, which is 20, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, I think the answer is 120. But let me just make sure. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and when expanding, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion by the constant term in the second expansion. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term involving \\(c\\), you'd get a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is not just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the only way to get a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems odd because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a number. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". Hmm, perhaps I need to consider the entire expansion, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6 times each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would result in the coefficient being a sum of terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient, so maybe it's just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because coefficients are usually numerical factors. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that might not be correct either. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part would be multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient would be 6 times each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient, so perhaps it's expecting the coefficient as a numerical factor, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering \\(c\\) as a variable and is looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). But the problem only specifies \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems plausible. Let me check this reasoning again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient in the product would be 6 multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But if we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then perhaps we're considering the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting a different approach. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I should expand both parts separately and then multiply the terms. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) has the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, as we found. Then, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times each coefficient from the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought earlier. So, maybe 384 is the answer. But wait, let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient to be 6 multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Therefore, I think the correct approach is to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384. Wait, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. So, the coefficient would be 6 * \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. Let me check with a different approach. Let me consider the entire product as a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the terms are independent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second part. But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, perhaps it's considering the coefficient as a polynomial, but that doesn't make sense because coefficients are numbers. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient to be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so when you multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), then all the terms from the second expansion will just multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, maybe the second part can be any term, but since it's multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all terms in the second expansion. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has multiple terms. But when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those would contribute to the overall expression.

So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't seem right either because each term in the second expansion is a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term would contribute to different terms in the product, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a single term. Wait, maybe I'm confusing the variables here. Let me try to clarify: The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, you'll have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m \\times (1/c)^{6 - m}\\) for various \\(k\\) and \\(m\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so we're only interested in the terms where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion (which is 6) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, because each term in the second part will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that can't be right because the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term would be a separate term in the product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384? But that seems high. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a single term, but in reality, when you multiply, you'll have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems like a lot. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms, which would include terms with different powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's just 6 times the entire expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the expansion includes \\(c\\) terms. Wait, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, we can treat the second part as a separate polynomial and when multiplied by the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. So, 6 times 64 is 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it and the answer is just 6, but that doesn't seem right because the second part is also being multiplied. Wait, let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all terms in the second expansion, which is 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second expansion). The sum of coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so that's 2^6 = 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the second expansion doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so the coefficient remains 6. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply by the second expansion, which has multiple terms, each term would contribute to the overall coefficient. So, perhaps the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it and the answer is just 6, but I'm not sure. Let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion would be \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this case would be 0 because \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present. Wait, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, if I take \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), then the expansion is \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The term \\(ab\\) would be present, but in this case, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 2, so 1 * 2 = 2. But in reality, the expansion is \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\), so the term \\(ab\\) isn't present. Wait, maybe my approach is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first part because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so it's just a scalar multiple. So, if the second part evaluates to a number, then the coefficient would be 6 times that number. But wait, the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which isn't a number unless we substitute a value for \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating it as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. Wait, but the problem asks for the coefficient, which is usually a number. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would be a polynomial, not a single number. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). So, maybe the answer is just 6. But I'm not sure. Let me try to think differently. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, and it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient becomes 6 times that coefficient. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps we need to sum all those contributions. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. But let me verify this with another approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), can be expanded using the binomial theorem as \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when I multiply this by \\(a^2b^2\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each of these terms, resulting in terms like \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384, as before. So, I think that's the correct approach. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, since the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) contributes a factor that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), sums all its coefficients. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these results gives the final coefficient as \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

So, perhaps the answer is 6. But I'm not entirely sure.\n\nWait, let me try another approach. Let me expand both parts separately and see what happens. First, \\((a + b)^4\\) expanded is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Now, the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, perhaps the answer is 6.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second.

But the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but that seems like a lot. Let me check that again. The second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has terms with coefficients that are binomial coefficients. The sum of all coefficients is indeed \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, if I multiply each term in the first expansion by each term in the second, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because each term in the second expansion has a different power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually 6 times the entire second expansion, which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire second expansion. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), which would still be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but that seems too large. Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when I multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\) would be 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which could be interpreted as the coefficient regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest is separate. But I'm not sure. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to see if there's another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve multiplying the coefficients from each part. So, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient is 6, and from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient is... Wait, no, because the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so maybe the coefficient is just 6, and the rest is separate.\n\nWait, I'm confused. Let me try to think of it differently. If I have two polynomials, say P(a, b) and Q(c), then the coefficient of a specific term in P(a, b) remains the same when multiplied by Q(c), because Q(c) doesn't involve a or b. So, for example, if P(a, b) = 6a^2b^2 + ... and Q(c) = something, then P(a, b)*Q(c) would have terms like 6a^2b^2*Q(c) + ... So, the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the product would be 6*Q(c), which is a polynomial in c. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient from P(a, b), which is 6, and not considering Q(c). Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to recognize that the coefficient of a^2b^2 is 6, regardless of the c terms.\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of a^2b^2 would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the product, which is the same as the coefficient in the first part, because the second part doesn't affect a and b. So, the coefficient is just 6. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to multiply 6 by the entire second expansion, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I should just look at the problem again. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would be a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting me to recognize that the coefficient is 6, and the rest is separate.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, perhaps the answer is just 6.\n\nWait, but that seems too simple. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but when I multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in one part is multiplied by each term in the other part. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be 6 times each term in the second expansion, resulting in a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps the answer is 6.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms, which would be 6. So, maybe the answer is 6.\n\nBut then, I'm confused because the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a separate expansion. So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, but that would be a polynomial, not a number. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.

The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6*64=384.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it doesn't affect the a and b terms. So, maybe the answer is 6.\n\nWait, but when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times each coefficient from the second expansion, but that would result in a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is expecting me to recognize that the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial, but that seems odd because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think of it differently. If I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\), then when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384.\n\nWait, that seems logical. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nBut let me check that again. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, yes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still confused because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), so maybe the answer is just 6. Alternatively, maybe it's 384.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which has coefficients from \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to recognize that the coefficient is just 6, and the rest is separate. So, maybe the answer is 6.\n\nWait, but I think the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part, which would make the coefficient a polynomial.

So, the answer is 6.\n\nBut then, why is the second part there?

So, the coefficient remains 6.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Let me check with a smaller example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 0 because it's a degree 4 term, but in this case, the highest degree is 2. Wait, that's a bad example. Let me try another one.\n\nSuppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion is \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is c + 1/c, which is a polynomial. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a\\), it's a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, it's \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, in that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Then, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Using the binomial theorem, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). So, setting \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6*20=120.\n\nWait, that seems plausible. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. But the problem didn't specify the power of \\(c\\), so maybe that's not the case.\n\nWait, but the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying \\(c\\). So, perhaps it's expecting the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a number.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the rest is separate, so the answer is 6.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but that seems like a lot.

Let me check with a smaller example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion is \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial. So, if I were to ask for the coefficient of \\(a\\), it's a polynomial, not a number. So, in that case, the coefficient is a polynomial. Similarly, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, perhaps the answer is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a number.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 times the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, so 6*20=120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion, but that's a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps I should go back to the original problem and see if I'm interpreting it correctly. The problem is: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\"\n\nSo, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable. So, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), specifically 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but that seems more plausible. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one part is multiplied by each term in the other part. So, if I have a term \\(6a^2b^2\\) and I multiply it by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion. But that would result in a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting me to recognize that the coefficient is a polynomial, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the rest is separate. So, the answer is 6.\n\nWait, but I think the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial. But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\).

Let me try to look for another approach. Let me consider that when you have two independent variables, the coefficients multiply. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the product of the coefficients from each part. But in this case, the first part's coefficient is 6, and the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial.

The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

    "text": " Wait, no, because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the other terms involving \\(c\\) won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Let me think. So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part, because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a single term, and when you multiply it by the entire second expression, it's like \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But that seems too broad. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try another approach. Let me first consider that the entire expression is the product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, which are terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) can be from -6 to 6, I think. But since the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, because each term in the second part contributes to a different power of \\(c\\), but the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is just being multiplied by each of those. Wait, that doesn't make sense because each term in the second expansion is a separate term, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But that's not correct either because the second expansion isn't just adding up the coefficients, it's a product. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6 times each term in the second expansion, but since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would actually be 6 multiplied by the entire second expansion's coefficients. But wait, no, because each term in the second expansion is a separate term. So, for example, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), 20, \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), \\(1/c^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be 6 times each of those coefficients, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps we have to sum all those contributions? Wait, that seems conflicting. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. So, in other words, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\), but no, the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the second expansion isn't a constant; it's a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those, you get different terms, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would actually be zero because \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, there is no term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually zero. Wait, that makes sense because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you're introducing \\(c\\) terms into every product, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only exist if it's multiplied by a term that has \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Oh, that's it! So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by 6 to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the \\(c^0\\) term, which is 1, you get \\(a^2b^2\\), and all other terms would have \\(c\\) in them, which we don't want. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's do that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(m=3\\) gives us \\(c^{6 - 2*3} = c^0\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, so multiplying them gives 6*20=120. That seems correct. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. So, when you multiply these together, you get 6*20=120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120. That seems right. I think I've got it.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\).

So, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part, and \\(c\\) is in the other, maybe the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, when you multiply two expressions, the terms in each are multiplied by each other. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part would be multiplied by every term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps all those terms from the second part contribute to scaling the coefficient.

But that doesn't seem right because each term in the second expansion would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, is that correct? Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe the \\(c\\) part doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion of the \\(c\\) part, but that seems too large. Wait, no, that can't be right because each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a separate term, so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term would contribute a multiple of \\(a^2b^2\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps all the terms from the second expansion would be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), and thus the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, that might not be correct because each term in the second expansion is a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), but the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which would require \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in the second expansion. So, maybe I only need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6 to get the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). That makes more sense. So, let's check that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Now, the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find the constant term in this expansion, we can use the binomial theorem again. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero for the constant term, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the constant term in the second expansion is 20. So, when we multiply the two expansions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but only the constant term in the second expansion (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) would result in a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and no \\(c\\) terms. All other terms would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, so they wouldn't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. So, I think that's the correct answer. I don't think I made any mistakes here.

So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term would only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because any other term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would have some power of \\(c\\), and since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is to multiply it by the constant term from the second part. So, perhaps I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6, which is the coefficient from the first part. Let me check that reasoning again. So, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would have terms of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but is that correct? Let me make sure I'm not missing anything. So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when you multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, giving \\(6 * 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). That seems right. Alternatively, maybe I should think of the entire expansion as a product, and since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only term that contributes is when we take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and the constant term from the second part. So, yeah, that would make the coefficient 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's correct. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me make sure there's no other way that \\(a^2b^2\\) could appear with some \\(c\\) terms. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) factors, the only way it can appear in the product is by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part by the constant term from the second part. Any other term from the second part would introduce a \\(c\\) term, which would make the resulting term have \\(c\\) in it, which we don't want. So, yes, only the constant term from the second part would contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, 120 is the correct coefficient.\n\nAnother way to think about it: The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanding this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion can only pair with the term that doesn't have \\(c\\) in it, which is the constant term. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me just compute the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) to confirm. So, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, for each m from 0 to 6, the exponents of c are 6, 4, 2, 0, -2, -4, -6. So, when m=3, we get the term where the exponent is 0, which is the constant term. So, that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\\). So, yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's solid.

    "text": " Wait, no, because when you multiply two expressions, each term in one expression gets multiplied by each term in the other. So, if I'm looking for a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), then I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is a constant term, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because when I multiply that by \\(a^2b^2\\), it will just contribute a scalar multiple to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, perhaps I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient 6 from the first part. Let me check that. So, first, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Then, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, I want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), I get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when I multiply the two expressions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. So, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. When you multiply the two expressions together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expression will be multiplied by each term in the second expression, including the constant term 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two expansions. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these out, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term in the second part, because any other terms in the second part would introduce factors of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which wouldn't be present in \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, I think that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe we can consider that the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit off because the entire expression would involve terms with \\(c\\), but the question is only about \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe the coefficient is just 6 times whatever the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is. Wait, but that doesn't seem right either because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has its own coefficient, and when you multiply by 6, you might be distributing it across all those terms, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term. So, maybe the answer is just 6 because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms? Hmm, that seems too simple. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it and the coefficient is indeed 6, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms because when you multiply by the entire expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would just be multiplied by each term in that expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) be 6 times 64, which is 384? Hmm, that seems more plausible. Let me think again. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be seen as two separate expansions multiplied together. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it would just carry the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the sum of coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are multiplied but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient remains 6. But that seems contradictory because when you multiply two expressions, each term is multiplied by all terms in the other expression, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the other expression. So, if the other expression's sum of coefficients is 64, then 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be interpreted differently, such as finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the other part. So, I think 384 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Another approach: The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I expand each part separately, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) has terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), \\(b^4\\). Similarly, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would have terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^5 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c} = 6c^4\\), \\(15c^3 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^2} = 15c\\), \\(20c^2 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^3} = 20 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c}\\), etc. But when I multiply these two expansions together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) contributes its own coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), resulting in \\(a^2b^2\\) times each of those terms. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 (from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I calculated earlier, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that when you multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by each term in the other expansion, so the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the other expansion. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the final answer is 384.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider another approach. Suppose I don't separate the two parts. Let me think about the entire product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanding, each term in the product will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the \\(c\\) terms, that would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), which gives us \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for the \\(c\\) terms, we have \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum over all possible \\(m\\) values. So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum over \\(m\\) from 0 to 6 of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), because each term \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\) contributes to the coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m\\) from 0 to 6 is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that confirms the earlier result.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. When I'm considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\), it's multiplied by each term in the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion, which includes terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would indeed be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the final answer is 384.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The entire expression also includes \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), whose sum of coefficients is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 because the second part is multiplied as a whole, but that can't be because the second part has terms that would affect the overall coefficient when multiplied by 6. Wait, maybe I'm confusing something here. Let me approach it differently. Let me denote the first part as \\(A = (a + b)^4\\) and the second part as \\(B = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the product is \\(A \\times B\\).

So, when we multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(B\\), we get terms like \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{k}a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all the coefficients from \\(B\\) multiplied by 6. So, that is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\). But the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\) is when we set \\(c = 1\\), so \\(B\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, is that correct? Because when you have \\(A \\times B\\), each term in \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. Hmm, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and since \\(B\\) is multiplied as a whole, perhaps the coefficient is just 6, and the \\(c\\) terms are separate. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, each term in \\(B\\) contributes to the overall coefficient. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to write it out. So, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The term we care about is \\(6a^2b^2\\). Then, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when we multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in this sum, we get terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum over all \\(k\\) of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\), because each term in \\(B\\) contributes \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) as a coefficient when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\).

Wait, no, that might not be right. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we need to find all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that are constants, i.e., terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because only then will the multiplication by \\(a^2b^2\\) result in a term that has only \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we found to be 6.

Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in this expansion has an exponent of \\(c\\) equal to \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the term where the exponent is zero because that's the constant term. So, setting \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), we can solve for \\(m\\): \\(6 = 2m\\) \u21d2 \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term occurs when \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).

So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0), which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) \u21d2 \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from each expansion:**\n   Since the constant term in the second expansion doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"
