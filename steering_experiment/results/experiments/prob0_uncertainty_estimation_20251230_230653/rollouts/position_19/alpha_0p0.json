    "text": " Wait, no, actually, the \\(c\\) terms might affect the overall expression, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the \\(c\\) terms can be considered as separate factors that don't interfere with the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, but actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second. So, if I'm looking for a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), then I need to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, and it's multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that doesn't seem right either because the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) have their own variables. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so if I'm looking for a specific term in the product, like \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be the product of the corresponding terms from each polynomial. But in this case, the second polynomial doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, so when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second polynomial, the resulting term would be \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that can't be right because each term would have a different power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but that would mean that the coefficient is the same as the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad. Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, so maybe it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is the same as the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) are not just numbers; they are multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms, which isn't a single number. So, perhaps I need to first find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\). That seems plausible. Let me check: If I consider the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and I'm looking for the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would be a huge number, and it's probably not what the problem is asking for. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term, then it's the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) and the constant term of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That seems more reasonable. So, perhaps I should proceed under that assumption. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found to be 6. Then, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me calculate that. To find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure. Is the problem asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, or specifically when multiplied by the constant term? Because if it's regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's not a single number. Alternatively, if it's asking for the coefficient when considering all terms, including the \\(c\\) terms, then perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Wait, but the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which implies that it's considering the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the specific term \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, it's more likely that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, but that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't what the problem is asking for. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), so the answer is 120. Let me just double-check my steps. First, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. Yes, that seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, calculated using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20, found by setting the exponent of \\(c\\) to zero, which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

But maybe the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, so perhaps I'm supposed to consider only the constant term in the \\(c\\) part? Or perhaps it's a misinterpretation. Wait, no, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would include all terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems complicated, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient in the sense of the product, so when you multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times each coefficient from the second expansion, but that would make the coefficient a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, it becomes \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so that part is fixed. Now, for each \\(m\\), we have a term \\(a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) multiplied by \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), which is not a single number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the constant term in \\(c\\). If that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when the entire expression is expanded, considering only the terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, let me proceed under that assumption. So, first, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. To find that, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (assuming we're considering the constant term in \\(c\\)) is 120. Wait, but let me double-check if I'm correct in assuming that the problem wants the constant term in \\(c\\). The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial. However, that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, it's more likely that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). So, I think my approach is correct, and the answer is 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a single number. Therefore, it's more reasonable to assume that the problem is asking for the coefficient when the entire expression is expanded, and specifically the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\) and is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I must have misinterpreted the problem. Perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but without considering \\(c\\). That is, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, but that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which again doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a sum of terms involving different powers of \\(c\\), which is not a single number. Therefore, I think the only plausible interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this by another approach. Let me consider the entire expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6\\(a^2b^2\\). Now, when we multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will be multiplied by 6\\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems odd. However, if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), that is, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, then the coefficient would indeed be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term in \\(c\\). So, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 20, giving 120. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 120.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me calculate \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the constant term. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). The term where the exponent is zero is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, yes, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 times 20, which is 120. So, I think that's correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients from each polynomial whose exponents add up to the desired term. In this case, since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), we only take the term from the first polynomial that is \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6, and then multiply it by each term from the second polynomial. But if we want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), that would be 6 times the entire second polynomial, which is not a number. Therefore, the only way for the coefficient to be a number is if we're considering the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, that's why we need to find the constant term in the second polynomial and multiply it by 6. So, yes, 120 is the correct answer.\n\nI think I've thought this through thoroughly and I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0):\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Oh! So, maybe the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, when you expand the entire expression, what is the coefficient for the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient would be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would contribute a coefficient when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, that's not right either. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) would be \\(6\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think is referring to the coefficient when considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, if that's the case, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that seems too large. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and then this is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is of the form \\(k c^n\\), and when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), gives \\(6k a^2b^2 c^n\\). So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), setting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of coefficients is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right. So, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Let me assume that's the case. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then multiply them together. So, first, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, what's the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Let's use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), we multiply the coefficients from each part: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but earlier I thought it might be 384, but that was under the assumption that we were considering all coefficients, which doesn't make sense. So, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Let me confirm this. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(6a^2b^2\\). \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives \\(20c^0\\). Multiplying them together gives \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2c^0 = 120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 120. Therefore, the answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me break it down. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand this, every term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can consider only the terms from \\((a + b)^4\\) that have \\(a^2b^2\\) and then, when multiplied by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). But wait, no, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), meaning that we need to sum over all possible coefficients from the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that might not make sense. Let me re-read the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, when we expand the product, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or something like that, where \\(m\\) is some exponent from the second part. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to consider all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, each multiplied by their corresponding coefficients from the \\(c\\) part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributing to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Wait, that might not be correct. Alternatively, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is simply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. So, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we found earlier as 6. Now, we need to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting the variable to 1. So, if we set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that we need to consider only the terms where \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). Because otherwise, if we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it would be 6 * 64, as I thought before. But perhaps the problem is more precise and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, it would be 6 * 64 = 384. But let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would involve summing over all possible exponents of \\(c\\). So, each term in the product would be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). But we want the coefficient where \\(a^2b^2\\), so \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when we multiply the two parts, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), because each term from the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. The sum of all coefficients in the second part is indeed \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), as I calculated before. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about it differently. Since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6, and then we can consider that this term is multiplied by every term in the second expression. So, the total contribution to \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. But wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Since the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, as we found, then 6 * 64 = 384. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), we would have needed to find the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., \\(c^{6 - 2m} = c^0\\), which implies \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Then, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384. Wait, but let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c+\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't mention \\(c\\), so perhaps it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but it's not specified. Hmm. Let me think. If I were to take the product, the terms would be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{6 - 2m}\\), where \\(k\\) is from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) is from 0 to 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would include all terms where \\(k = 2\\), and \\(m\\) can be anything from 0 to 6, because the problem doesn't specify any constraint on \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). The sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm not confusing the terms. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would include all possible exponents of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had been to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we would have to find the specific term where \\(c\\) cancels out, which would be when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Then, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 * 20 = 120\\). But since the problem didn't specify \\(c\\), I think it's 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when problems ask for a coefficient without specifying other variables, they might mean the coefficient regardless of those variables, but in this case, the expression has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so the entire expression is a Laurent polynomial in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would include all possible powers of \\(c\\), meaning that it's the sum of all coefficients from the second part multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. So, I think 384 is correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose we have \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When we multiply them, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, which is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). The sum \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but I just thought of another way. Let me consider that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Since the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, as we saw, then 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think I'm confident now that the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

But wait, if the term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^2b^2\\), then when we multiply it by any term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\), that would mean that the only contribution comes from the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because that's the only way the \\(c\\) terms would cancel out, leaving a constant term. So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term we're interested in. So, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when we multiply these two parts together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, is that all? Let me double-check. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives a term \\(c^0\\) with coefficient 20. Multiplying them together, \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\), so the coefficient is 120. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I should think about it differently. Since the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the expansion would involve terms where each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we only consider the term in the second part that has \\(c^0\\), because multiplying by \\(c^0\\) won't change the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 (from the first part) times 20 (from the second part), which is 120. Yeah, I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, the coefficient should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the problem is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe the \\(c\\) terms will just contribute a factor that we can include. But actually, no, because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is just a scalar factor that gets multiplied by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\). Wait, that doesn't sound right because the \\(c\\) terms might have their own coefficients, but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the \\(c\\) terms don't affect it. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). We need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, when you multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), every term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), we can take the coefficient 6 from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would give us a sum involving \\(c\\) terms. However, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the product would be the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part by every term in the second part. So, actually, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not right either. Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is of the form \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is a different term. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not correct because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has its own coefficient, but when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term becomes \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) [term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)]. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not right because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which would give \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too high. Let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6, and the \\(c\\) terms don't affect it because they're separate variables. But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients combine. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's a product of two expressions, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables are separate. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the first part, and when you multiply by the second part, which is in terms of \\(c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by each term in the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's actually the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, that can't be because the expansion of the second part includes terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6, and the \\(c\\) terms don't affect it because they are separate variables. But that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, we would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering only the terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, that would require finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, let me break it down. First, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as before. Now, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the middle term, which occurs when the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) balance out to give \\(c^0\\). Let me find that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be done using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. When you have two separate variables, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in one part, and \\(c\\) in the other, the terms are independent. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and when multiplied by the entire second part, it would produce terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). So, perhaps the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But that can't be right because when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by all terms in the second part, resulting in \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) terms for different \\(k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the sum of all coefficients from the second part multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 (sum of coefficients in the second part). The sum of coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But that contradicts my earlier conclusion of 120. Hmm, so which is correct? Let me think carefully. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or something like that. But the problem is only interested in terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively. So, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\), we need to find all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 \u00d7 (sum of coefficients in the second part). Since the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, as I found earlier, the total coefficient would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But wait, that seems high. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we can treat the second part as a constant. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is a variable expression. So, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me try another approach. Let me consider the entire expression as a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables are independent. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from the first part, and any term from the second part would multiply it, but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Therefore, 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct answer. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 120. So, where did I go wrong? Let me check. When I considered the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), I found it to be 20, so 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. But that's only if we're considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). However, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 \u00d7 (sum of coefficients in the second part), which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. So, I think I was correct the second time. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from this part is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expression is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part (6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part (64):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

The expression is the product of two separate expansions: one in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\).

But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we're only interested in the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, right? Because if we have any \\(c\\) terms, they would affect the overall expression, but since the problem is asking for a term without \\(c\\), perhaps we need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\). Wait, that makes sense. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I found earlier. Then, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply those two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. Okay, so now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me apply the binomial theorem here as well.

The constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, since we're multiplying \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the product of the coefficients we found in each part. That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (the constant term). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. Wait, let me double-check that I didn't make any mistakes here. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).

So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. As I calculated before, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me check with a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. Wait, that's different. So, in that case, the coefficient is zero because the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. So, in our original problem, the second part only has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second part, but since the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 384. But in the simpler example, the coefficient was zero because the second part didn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Wait, no, in the simpler example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present in the product. Wait, no, in the product \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the terms are \\(a^2c\\), \\(a^2 \\times 1/c\\), \\(2ab c\\), \\(2ab \\times 1/c\\), \\(b^2c\\), and \\(b^2 \\times 1/c\\). So, there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient is zero. Therefore, in our original problem, since the second part doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be zero. Wait, that contradicts my earlier conclusion. Hmm, so which is it?\n\nWait, let me think carefully. In the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are all in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Therefore, the resulting terms would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from -6 to 6 in steps of 2, I think. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean we're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, in the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is the constant term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's do that. Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, that makes more sense. So, I think I made a mistake earlier by considering the sum of all coefficients, but actually, we only want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the only term that would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the correct coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, let me confirm this. So, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. Yes, that seems correct. So, my initial approach was wrong because I didn't consider that we only want the constant term from the second expansion. Therefore, the correct coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. This happens when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these results gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Wait, actually, no, because when you multiply the two expansions together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't seem right because then the coefficient would depend on the \\(c\\) terms as well. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term will come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that can't be right because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be the value when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the \\(c\\) terms could affect the overall expression, but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would just be the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, let me check that again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) expanded, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\). The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\), which is 6a^2b^2. Now, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is another expansion. So, the entire product would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the second sum, \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when I multiply these two sums together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will come from the product of the term 6a^2b^2 and the entire second sum. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), because each term's coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), and the variables are \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the sum of coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems correct, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6, but that doesn't seem right because the entire expression includes the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the entire product. So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all possible terms from the second expansion, which are powers of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would appear with coefficients from the second expansion, but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(c^0\\) is the term where the exponents cancel out, which is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, now I'm confused because I got two different answers: 384 and 120. Which one is correct? Let me clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term will be of the form \\(a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient from the first part is 6. Then, for each \\(m\\), the second part contributes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\) is 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) term, I think it's the sum over all \\(m\\) of 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), which is 6 * 2^6 = 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, we need to find the coefficient where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which occurs when in the second expansion, the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying the power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean we consider all possible powers of \\(c\\)? Or just the constant term? Hmm. I think in algebra, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term, like \\(a^2b^2\\), in a product, it's understood that you're considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of other variables. So, in this case, since the product includes terms with different powers of \\(c\\), each term would be \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\), and the coefficient would be 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for each \\(m\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's the sum over all \\(m\\) of 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), which is 6 * (sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for m=0 to 6) = 6 * 2^6 = 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems counterintuitive because \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\), so each of those would be separate terms, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same across all those terms. Wait, no, the coefficient is specific to each term. So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire expression, and \\(a^2b^2\\) is treated as a single term, regardless of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure. Let me think again. The problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the expanded form, each term will be of the form \\(a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear in the product when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient from the first part is 6. Then, for each \\(m\\), the second part contributes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) is 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\) is 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's the sum over all \\(m\\) of 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), then it's 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) = 6 * 20 = 120. So, I'm not sure which interpretation is correct. Let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second expansion) = 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Let me try to think of it another way. If I were to expand the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. But wait, another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct answer. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would have been 120. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's 384. Wait, but that seems too large. Let me check with an example. Suppose I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 * 64\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, so in the product, it's 6 * 64 = 384. So, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

So, maybe I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me try that approach. So, first, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), which is indeed \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me try another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when I multiply this by \\((a + b)^4\\), which has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), the product will have terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can consider that each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by its coefficient, so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if this is correct. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. Because each term in the second expression, regardless of its \\(c\\) power, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, yes, that would make sense. So, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because I feel like the answer might be different. Let me try to compute it another way. Alternatively, maybe I can consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, since \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to a sum of terms, each with their own coefficients, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). Then, when you multiply them, the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q(c). Because every term in Q(c) will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing their coefficients. So, yes, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with a smaller example to see if this logic holds. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this case would be zero because \\((a + b)^2\\) only goes up to \\(b^2\\), but when multiplied by \\((c + 1/c)\\), which is degree 1 in c, but that's separate from a and b. Wait, no, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would still be zero because \\((a + b)^2\\) doesn't have a \\(b^2\\) term that's multiplied by another \\(b^2\\). Wait, actually, in \\((a + b)^2\\), the term \\(a^2\\) has coefficient 1, \\(2ab\\) has coefficient 2, and \\(b^2\\) has coefficient 1. So, when multiplied by \\((c + 1/c)\\), each term in \\((a + b)^2\\) is multiplied by each term in \\((c + 1/c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product would be 1 * (1 + 1) = 2, because \\(c + 1/c\\) evaluated at c=1 is 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2 * 2 = 4, and the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) would be 1 * 2 = 2. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 2, which is the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^2\\) times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\). So, that seems to check out. Therefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) should indeed be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I'm confusing the concept. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a separate variable, perhaps the coefficients from that expansion don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6, and then multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), it's just 6 times the entire expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so we need the \\(c^0\\) term from the second expansion. So, let's compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, as I did earlier, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So, which one is correct?\n\nHmm, so now I'm confused. Earlier, I thought it was 384, but now I think it's 120. Let me figure out which approach is correct. So, in the first approach, I considered that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, giving 384. But in the second approach, I considered that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, giving 120. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps the second approach is correct because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. So, in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, giving 120. That makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), only the term with \\(c^0\\) will result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms will have \\(c\\) raised to some power, so they won't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the correct coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let's take a simpler example to verify. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because \\((a + b)^2\\) only has up to \\(b^2\\), but when multiplied by \\((c + 1/c)\\), which is degree 1 in \\(c\\), but that's separate. Wait, no, in this case, \\((a + b)^2\\) is \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no \\(b^2\\) term multiplied by another \\(b^2\\). Wait, no, in this case, the product would be \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), which would have terms like \\(a^2c\\), \\(a^2 \\times 1/c\\), \\(2ab c\\), \\(2ab \\times 1/c\\), \\(b^2 c\\), and \\(b^2 \\times 1/c\\). So, there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term because none of the terms in the product would have both \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) multiplied together. So, the coefficient is zero, which aligns with the idea that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^2\\) is zero, so when multiplied by any term in \\((c + 1/c)\\), it's still zero.\n\nWait, but that's a different case because \\((a + b)^2\\) doesn't have \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me try another example where \\((a + b)^3\\) is multiplied by \\((c + 1/c)^2\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b\\) in \\((a + b)^3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{3}{1} = 3\\). Now, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\((c + 1/c)^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{2}{1} = 2\\), because \\(c^2 \\times 1/c^1 = c^1\\), and \\(c^0\\) term is when \\(m=1\\), so \\(\\dbinom{2}{1} = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b\\) in the product would be 3 * 2 = 6. Let me check by expanding: \\((a + b)^3 = a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3\\). \\((c + 1/c)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). So, the product would have terms like \\(a^3c^2\\), \\(a^3 \\times 2\\), \\(a^3 \\times 1/c^2\\), \\(3a^2b c^2\\), \\(3a^2b \\times 2\\), \\(3a^2b \\times 1/c^2\\), etc. The term \\(3a^2b \\times 2\\) would be \\(6a^2b\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b\\) is indeed 6. So, in this case, the approach of multiplying the coefficient from the first polynomial by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial gives the correct result.\n\nTherefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the correct answer should be 120.\n\nWait, so earlier I thought it was 384, but after reconsidering, it's 120. So, I must have made a mistake in the first approach. The mistake was assuming that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, but actually, it's only multiplied by the coefficient of the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), which is the \\(c^0\\) term. So, the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nLet me double-check this. So, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, that's correct. Then, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Therefore, multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120. Yes, that seems right.\n\nWait, but let me make sure by considering another perspective. Let's think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables are independent. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, because only the \\(c^0\\) term doesn't introduce any \\(c\\) factors. So, that's consistent with what I found earlier. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nI think I've convinced myself now that the correct coefficient is 120. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which occurs when \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients together yields \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again. The entire expression is the product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply them together, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can treat the second part as a constant multiplier because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient, not the entire expansion. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to approach it differently. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the \\(c\\) terms will just be multiplied as well. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the \\(c\\) part can be considered as 1, or maybe it's not affecting the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will have multiple terms involving \\(c\\), but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some exponent \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps we can treat \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) as a single term when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, that might not be accurate. Let me clarify: when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, that would mean that we're looking for all the terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). Wait, but that's not possible because each term in the product will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents and \\(c\\) exponents. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, maybe the problem is miswritten, but assuming it's correctly written, perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. In that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)?\" Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a constant. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the expansion. If that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the product. So, to approach this, I can think of it as two separate binomial expansions multiplied together. The first expansion is \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me first find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already determined is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when I multiply these two, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. So, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), which equals 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (assuming they mean \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)) is 120. Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, I expanded \\((a + b)^4\\) and found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) correctly as 6. Then, I considered the second part \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and found the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) by solving \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gave \\(k = 3\\), and the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20.

Wait, no, actually, when we multiply the two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is a constant, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because if we have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a term that's just a number (since \\(c^0 = 1\\)), then that term will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, first, let me find the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part.

But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we need to find the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out, leaving a constant term. Because if the term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a constant, then when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it will still be part of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, perhaps I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. So, let's first find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, since we're multiplying \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when you multiply these two parts, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, resulting in \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient. Hmm, that seems right. Let me see if there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, I could consider that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each part, provided that the other terms don't affect it. Since the \\(c\\) terms are being multiplied, but we're only interested in the constant term from the \\(c\\) part, which is 20, and the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is 6, so 6 times 20 is indeed 120.

    "text": " Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Wait, actually, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them together, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we need to consider all possible terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times something, but since the problem doesn't specify any constraints on \\(c\\), perhaps we just need to consider the constant term in the second expansion? Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. Wait, no, the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that's not quite right because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that term must come from the product where the term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a constant term, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, I need to find two things: 1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I found earlier to be 6. 2. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply these two coefficients together to get the final coefficient. So, let me work on the second part. I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\cdot c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\) so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the two coefficients I found: 6 and 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent is zero is when \\(k = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.

When you have two separate expressions multiplied together, each term in the expansion of the first expression is multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second expression.

So, the idea is to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when we multiply it by \\(a^2b^2\\), it will just contribute a scalar multiple. So, let me first find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).

Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when we multiply these two expansions, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second.

So, that would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (the constant term in the second expansion). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.

Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, I can think about the entire expansion: \\((a + b)^4\\) gives a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives a term \\(20c^0\\), so when multiplied together, the term is \\(6 * 20 a^2b^2c^0 = 120a^2b^2\\).

Let me clarify: when you have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of those terms would contribute to the overall coefficient.

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on that.

We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.
