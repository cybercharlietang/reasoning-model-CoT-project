    "text": " That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, substituting \\(k = 2\\), the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient. Hmm, let me think. When I multiply two expressions together, the terms combine. So, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), it remains \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, is that correct? Let me make sure. If I have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^k\\), the resulting term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but since the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider only the terms where \\(c^k\\) is \\(c^0\\), because that's the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nAlright, so let me apply the binomial theorem again to \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The expansion would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, it's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m}\\), which is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which means \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, since we're multiplying \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But we only care about the term where the second part is \\(c^0\\), so that when multiplied, it doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)). \n\nCalculating that, 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, let me just double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6, and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiplying them gives 120, which seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes here. Yeah, that seems correct. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " That means I need to find the term where \\(a^{2}b^{2}\\), so in the binomial expansion, \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the product of these two expansions. But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That suggests that maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. Let me think. When you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply as well. But in this case, since we're looking for a specific term in the product, I need to see if the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is multiplied by any term in the second part that could affect it. However, the second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, it will be \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) something with \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but that term would have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a term from the second expansion, which could be any power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term from the second expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. When you have two separate variables, \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), their coefficients are independent. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will multiply each term in the second part, which are all in terms of \\(c\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's just the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expression. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but I don't think that's the case. Let me re-read the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the expanded form of the product, there will be terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), and the coefficient of each of these terms would be the product of the coefficients from each part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would actually be a sum over all possible \\(k\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term on its own, and when multiplied by the second expansion, it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you're effectively distributing \\(a^2b^2\\) across all those terms, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but is that correct? Let me think again. Suppose I have two expressions, \\(A = a^2b^2\\) and \\(B = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, the product \\(A \\times B\\) would be \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(B\\). But that's not quite right because each term in \\(B\\) has a different power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that's not accurate. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part times the coefficient from the second part for each term, but since the second part has multiple terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But that's not correct because each term in the product would be a combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) terms. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find all the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). So, that means I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the entire second part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which are all terms of the form \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\). Therefore, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) will have a coefficient of 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients of terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent. Wait, but that's not how it works. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you distribute, you're effectively scaling \\(a^2b^2\\) by each coefficient in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems too high. Let me check my reasoning again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire product, so it should account for the multiplication. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to treat \\(c\\) as a variable and consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), meaning that it's the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, i.e., the constant term. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify that. It just says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the answer is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 384. Let me verify this approach. Let's consider a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding this, we get \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because in the first part, the highest power of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is 2, and in the second part, we have \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But wait, in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present because the first part only goes up to \\(a^2b^0\\) and \\(b^2a^0\\). Wait, no, actually, in \\((a + b)^2\\), the terms are \\(a^2\\), \\(2ab\\), and \\(b^2\\). So, there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, in that case, the coefficient would be zero. But if I have \\((a + b)^3 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b\\) would be 3 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 2, so 6. But in reality, when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b\\) in the product would be 3 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 1, so 3. Wait, that's different. So, perhaps my initial approach was wrong. Let me think again. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), but in reality, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second part, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term. That would make more sense. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. That would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. Let me check that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, as we calculated earlier. Now, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the middle term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). But the problem didn't specify the power of \\(c\\), it just asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, this is confusing. Let me try to clarify. In the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\) for some \\(k\\) and \\(m\\). Wait, no, actually, each term in the first expansion is \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\) and each term in the second expansion is \\(c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are determined by the first part, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is determined by the second part. So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\), that would mean we need to sum over all possible exponents of \\(c\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term. That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a sum involving different powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the intended question is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120, as calculated earlier. Alternatively, if the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems too large, and also, it's not clear whether that's what the problem is asking for. Let me think again. The problem states: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, which includes terms with \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion. That would make sense, and the answer would be 6 times 20, which is 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and ignoring the second part, but that seems unlikely because the second part is part of the product. So, to resolve this confusion, let me look for similar problems or think about how coefficients work in products. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. In this case, the term we're interested in is \\(a^2b^2\\). However, since the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\), the exponents of \\(c\\) don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, but that would require considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). However, in standard polynomial terminology, the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a sum over all possible coefficients from the other variables. But that's not standard. Typically, when you ask for the coefficient of a term with specific exponents in some variables, you're considering all possible exponents in the other variables. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second polynomial. That would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But I'm not entirely sure if that's the correct interpretation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so it's ambiguous. However, in many problems, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term involving some variables, it's often implied that you're considering the coefficient regardless of the other variables, which would mean summing over all possibilities for those variables. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial, which is 6, but that seems unlikely because the problem includes the second polynomial in the expression. So, given this ambiguity, I think the more reasonable interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But I'm not entirely confident. Let me try to see if there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, perhaps I can treat the entire expression as a product of two independent binomial expansions and consider the coefficients separately. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), has the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), is a separate expansion. Since the variables \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\) are independent, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is simply 6 times the entire second expansion. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. But that seems odd because the problem includes the second part in the expression. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would require considering the multiplication. So, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you distribute, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. As calculated earlier, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. However, I'm still a bit unsure because in some contexts, the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) in a product would refer to the coefficient when considering all variables, but in this case, it's not clear. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is a distraction. But that seems unlikely because the problem explicitly includes the second part in the expression. So, to conclude, I think the intended answer is 384, which is 6 times 64, the sum of the coefficients in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in the second part is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

But wait, actually, no. Because when you multiply the two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, if I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\), then I just need to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those terms, I get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is the exponent from the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so it's treating \\(c\\) as another variable, meaning that \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a part of the expression, and the rest can have any power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, I think I might be misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as separate variables. That means, in the expanded form, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by some combination of powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first expansion. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, which are all terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that can't be right because the second part is a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\). Wait, no, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you're effectively scaling \\(a^2b^2\\) by each coefficient in the second expansion, and since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's equivalent to taking the coefficient from the first part and multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But wait, that doesn't seem right because the sum of all coefficients in the second part is just the value when \\(c = 1\\). So, perhaps I can compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and then multiply it by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me consider that in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is indeed 64. So, 6 times 64 is 384. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and since it's multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. But let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms in the first polynomial that multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial will be multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, that would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me make sure. Let me compute the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\), as I thought earlier. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times 64, which is 384. So, I think that's the answer. Wait, but let me just double-check. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that each term in the product is a combination of a term from the first polynomial and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first polynomial, and it's multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Since the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, as calculated, then 6 times 64 is 384. So, yes, I think that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider how this part affects the coefficient I just found. Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, actually, the part with \\(c\\) doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because it's a separate variable. So, does that mean the coefficient remains 6? Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the terms from the second expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would affect the coefficient only if they contribute to the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the power of 0, because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) in it, which isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) because that's the only term that won't affect the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). \n\nSo, to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). I need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), I get \\(6 = 2m\\) which means \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 times 20 is 120. \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two parts together, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only consider the constant term from the second part. So, yes, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. \n\nI think that's it. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. First, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. Then, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiply them together to get 120.

The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so does the second part affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. Since the second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), and the first part is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), when we multiply them together, the variables are separate. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part, right?

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Let me think about how the expansion works. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it will just be \\(a^2b^2\\) times something involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times whatever the constant term in the second expansion is. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be a product of two polynomials. So, when you multiply them, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is simply the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term. So, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. When you have two separate variables multiplied together, the coefficients don't interfere with each other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a sum of terms, not a single coefficient. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) a sum of terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests that we are considering it as a term in the expanded expression, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), so to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider the product where the \\(c\\) terms multiply to give a term without \\(c\\), which would be the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Oh, I see. So, I was wrong earlier. The coefficient isn't just 6; it's 6 multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me calculate that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, so I was initially mistaken in thinking that the coefficient remains 6, but actually, it's 6 multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120. That makes sense because when you multiply the two expressions together, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion, which is 20, hence the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. Let me just verify that again. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. When you multiply these two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by the constant term 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients from each expansion that contribute to that term. Since the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are separate from the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break it down into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0.

So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from the second part with coefficient 20. Since these are multiplied together, the overall coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (assuming \\(c^0\\)) is 120. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient. So, I think the intended question is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nLet me double-check. The first part: \\((a + b)^4\\), coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. The second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiply them together: 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. For the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, multiplying these together, 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems correct. \n\nI think that's the answer. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (assuming \\(c^0\\)) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by multiplying the coefficients from each part of the expansion. \n\n1. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{120}"

    "text": " That would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) in the binomial expansion because \\(4 - k = 2\\) implies \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nNow, the expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but this second part involves \\(c\\). Wait a second, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The other part of the expression is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when we multiply the two expressions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) terms, I think we need to consider the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), it would introduce \\(c\\) into the term, which we don't want. So, the only way the resulting term doesn't have any \\(c\\) is if it's multiplied by the constant term (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nTo find the constant term, I can again use the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero for the constant term, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we only want the term without any \\(c\\) (i.e., the constant term), we multiply the coefficient from the first part by the constant term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but let me double-check. When I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6, as I found. Then, when I expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when I multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only consider the multiplication of \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion. That is, \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nIs there any other term that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. Suppose in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), if I have a term with \\(c^k\\) and \\(1/c^k\\), but when I multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), the only way it would result in a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is if the \\(c\\) terms cancel out. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) would make the product have \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, only the constant term in the second expansion contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, I think my earlier conclusion is correct.\n\nJust to make sure, let me consider the entire expression. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), it's multiplied by all the terms in the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find how many ways we can get a term that doesn't have \\(c\\). That happens only when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), etc. Each of these is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, for each term in the first expansion, say \\(a^kb^{4 - k}\\), it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^m\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1/c^m\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 (from the first expansion) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second expansion), giving 120. \n\nI think that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does the second part affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, I think so. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two expressions together, the variables are separate. So, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the second part. So, actually, when you multiply them together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first part, 6, times the entire second expansion? But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is only in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), not involving \\(c\\). So, maybe the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because it's being multiplied by terms that involve \\(c\\), which are separate variables. Therefore, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) remains 6, regardless of the second part. \n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, and you add up the results. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think that when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the result will be terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). So, none of these will be just \\(a^2b^2\\); they will all have some power of \\(c\\) attached. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you're effectively scaling \\(a^2b^2\\) by the coefficients of the second expansion. But wait, no, that's not quite right either. Because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient and a power of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term, you get terms like \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you're not changing the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\); you're just adding more terms. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) remains 6, and the rest of the terms involve \\(c\\). But that seems contradictory because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients of the terms can change if there are like terms. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, so when you multiply it by the second expansion, you're not combining it with any other terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384? But that seems high. Let me think again. \n\nWait, no, that can't be right because each term in the second expansion is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so each term would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something like that. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, which has coefficients summing to 64, you end up with 384 as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible powers of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\); it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\). So, in that case, yes, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But let me verify that. Let me consider the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part. Each term in the second part is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these, you get terms like \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for \\(k\\) from 0 to 6, which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients combine only if the variables match. But in this case, the variables in the second polynomial are \\(c\\), so they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire second polynomial, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product being the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in each part. But since the second part doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), its coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero. Wait, no, that's not right. Because when you multiply by the second part, which doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second part, which has coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, let me check with a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). The second part is \\(c + 1/c\\). So, the product is \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product is zero because there are no \\(a^2b^2\\) terms. But according to my earlier logic, the coefficient should be 2 (from \\((a + b)^2\\)) times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), so 2 * 2 = 4. But in reality, the coefficient is zero. So, my earlier logic must be wrong. \n\nHmm, so that means that when I multiply the two expressions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't simply the product of the coefficients of each part. Instead, it's zero because there's no overlap in variables. So, in the original problem, since the second part doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, when multiplied by the second part, will not contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product because all the resulting terms will have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) attached. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually zero. \n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier thought. Let me think carefully. In the simpler example, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the product doesn't have any \\(a^2b^2\\) terms because all the terms in the product involve either \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) multiplied by \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero. Similarly, in the original problem, \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which introduces \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, the resulting terms will all be of the form \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), where \\(k\\) is some integer. Therefore, there are no terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) stands alone without any \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is zero. \n\nBut wait, that seems counterintuitive because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), implying that it's not zero. Maybe I made a mistake in my reasoning. Let me try to clarify. When you multiply two polynomials, the variables are independent. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), you have terms with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you have terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When you multiply them together, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, so the resulting terms will have all combinations of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), where \\(k\\) is the exponent from the second expansion. Since none of these terms are just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is zero. \n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). So, maybe the problem is only concerned with the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, 6 * 64 = 384. But in my simpler example, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 2 * 2 = 4, but in reality, it's zero because there are no such terms. So, my initial reasoning was correct that the coefficient is zero. \n\nWait, so in the simpler example, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the product is \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). There are no \\(a^2b^2\\) terms because you can't get \\(a^2b^2\\) by multiplying terms from the two polynomials. The first polynomial has up to \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\), but the second polynomial only has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is if both polynomials have \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, but the second one doesn't. Therefore, the coefficient is zero. Similarly, in the original problem, the second polynomial doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so you can't get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the coefficient is zero. \n\nWait, but that seems to contradict the idea that when you multiply polynomials, you can have cross terms. But in this case, since the second polynomial doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), there's no way to get a term that has both \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient is indeed zero. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I'm misapplying the concept. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, if the product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\), then each term in the product will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^{k} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, to get a term that is \\(a^2b^2\\), we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\), and then the term from the second polynomial can be any \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But wait, no, that's not quite right because each term in the product is a combination of a term from the first polynomial and a term from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then we would have to sum over all possible \\(m\\), because each \\(m\\) gives a different power of \\(c\\) attached to \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). \n\nBut \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). However, in the simpler example, this approach gave the wrong result. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me check the simpler example again. \n\nIn the simpler example, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), expanding gives \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). There are no \\(a^2b^2\\) terms, so the coefficient is zero. But according to the approach above, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{2}{1} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{1} \\dbinom{1}{m}\\), which is \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\). But that's not correct because there are no \\(a^2b^2\\) terms. So, my approach must be flawed. \n\nAh, I see the mistake. In the original problem, \\((a + b)^4\\) has a term \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the simpler example, \\((a + b)^2\\) has a term \\(a^2b^0\\) and \\(ab^1\\), but not \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the original problem, since \\((a + b)^4\\) does have a term \\(a^2b^2\\), when we multiply it by the second polynomial, which has terms in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the resulting product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\) is indeed the sum of the coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by the coefficient from the first polynomial. \n\nBut in the simpler example, since the first polynomial doesn't have a term \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient remains zero. Therefore, in the original problem, since the first polynomial does have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and the second polynomial has a sum of coefficients equal to 64, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but in the simpler example, if I consider \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because there are no such terms. So, in the original problem, the coefficient is 384 because there are terms \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). But in reality, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but the problem is stated as: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, it's possible that the problem is considering the entire product, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear with any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by the coefficient from the first polynomial. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears without any \\(c\\) terms, which would be zero because the second polynomial doesn't have a constant term. But in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term (i.e., the term where \\(c^0\\)) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, if we consider only the constant term, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. But I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for. \n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". It doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean summing over all possible powers of \\(c\\), which gives 6 * 64 = 384. But in the simpler example, that approach gave the wrong answer, so I must be missing something. \n\nWait, in the simpler example, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because there are no such terms. But according to the approach of multiplying the coefficients, it would be 2 * 2 = 4, which is incorrect. So, my approach must be wrong. Therefore, the correct way is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is zero because there's no way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). \n\nWait, but in the original problem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which includes a constant term (when \\(c^0\\)). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term would give \\(a^2b^2\\) times 1, which is \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the constant term of the second polynomial. \n\nSo, let's calculate the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term of the second polynomial, you get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. All other terms would have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so they wouldn't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) alone. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nLet me verify this with the simpler example. If I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the constant term in the second polynomial is when \\(c^0\\), which is when \\(k = 1\\), so the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{1}{1} = 1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is \\(\\dbinom{2}{1} = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 2 * 1 = 2. But when I expand \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), I get \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). There are no \\(a^2b^2\\) terms, so the coefficient should be zero, not 2. Hmm, this is confusing. \n\nWait, in this case, the first polynomial is \\((a + b)^2\\), which has terms \\(a^2\\), \\(2ab\\), and \\(b^2\\). The second polynomial is \\((c + 1/c)\\), which has a constant term of 1 when \\(c^0\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2\\) by 1, you get \\(a^2\\), when you multiply \\(2ab\\) by 1, you get \\(2ab\\), and when you multiply \\(b^2\\) by 1, you get \\(b^2\\). So, the product has terms \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c + a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). Wait, no, that's not correct because the second polynomial is only \\((c + 1/c)\\), so the product is \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), which expands to \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). There are no constant terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) because the second polynomial doesn't have a constant term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is still zero. \n\nWait, so in this case, even though the second polynomial has a constant term (when \\(c^0\\)), the first polynomial doesn't have a term that would result in \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by the constant term. So, the coefficient remains zero. Therefore, in the original problem, the first polynomial does have a term \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second polynomial has a constant term of 20, so when you multiply them, you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times 20, contributing to the coefficient. \n\nWait, but in the simpler example, the first polynomial doesn't have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so even though the second polynomial has a constant term, the coefficient remains zero. So, in the original problem, since the first polynomial does have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, and the second polynomial has a constant term, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but in the simpler example, if I take \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the product is \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). There are no \\(a^2b^2\\) terms, so the coefficient is zero. But if I take \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\), the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), including \\(k = 0\\), which is the constant term. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term 20 gives \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me consider the general term in the product. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. The term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20. So, when you multiply these two terms, you get \\(6 \\times 20 \\times a^2b^2c^0 = 120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part. \n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The constant term (where \\(c^0\\)) occurs when the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, which happens when \\(k = 3\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nMultiplying the coefficients from each part gives:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " That would correspond to when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, substituting \\(k = 2\\) into the binomial coefficient, we get \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), that involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when I multiply the two expansions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't be affected by the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients in the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which doesn't make sense because we're looking for a specific coefficient, not a polynomial. Wait, no, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. When you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, each term contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, yes, that would be correct. So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think differently. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms with different powers of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps all the terms in the second expansion will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would indeed be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Let me try another approach. Let me consider the entire expression: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I expand both parts separately, then when I multiply them, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part, whether it's \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), etc., when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times that term. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a scalar in the product, the coefficient will be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me check with a smaller example to see if this approach works. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Let's compute this manually. \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1 = c + 1/c\\). Now, multiplying these together: \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present in the product. Wait, but according to my previous approach, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the first part is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 2, so 1 * 2 = 2. But in reality, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 1 times (c + 1/c), so the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be c + 1/c, which isn't a scalar. So, perhaps my approach is wrong.\n\nWait, so maybe I can't just multiply the coefficients like that. Instead, perhaps I need to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in each part, but since the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's more complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), because the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will contribute to the coefficient. So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in my small example, that approach didn't work. So, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me compute that small example more carefully. Let me take \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion is \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But according to my approach, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 0 because in \\((a + b)^2\\), the highest power of \\(b\\) is 2, but to get \\(a^2b^2\\), you need both \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\), but in \\((a + b)^2\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't exist because the expansion is \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is zero, which when multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second part (which is 2) gives zero, which matches the actual result. So, perhaps my approach is correct.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the first part does have a term \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient is 6, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. So, maybe that's the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product being the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in each part, but since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient there is 1 (since it's like 1 times \\(a^2b^2\\)), so 6 * 1 = 6. But that contradicts my earlier approach. Hmm, maybe that's not the right way.\n\nWait, perhaps another way: the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, the term we're looking for is \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to the coefficient. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product being equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not in \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be 6 times each term in the second expansion. But since we're just looking for the coefficient, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me compute \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) to confirm. Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in my small example earlier, when I took \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) was zero because there was no such term. But according to my approach, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is zero, so 0 * 2 = 0, which is correct. So, in the problem, since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, the coefficient in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem and properties of polynomial multiplication.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   Thus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, this expansion will have terms involving various powers of \\(c\\).

But wait, that would make the coefficient 6 times \\(2^6\\) because each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a binomial coefficient times \\(c^k\\) times \\(1/c^{6 - k}\\), but the sum of coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's correct. Wait, no, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second expression, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which isn't a number. That doesn't make sense. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That would make more sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. Let me try that approach.\n\nSo, first, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, since the original expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) will be the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and the \\(c^0\\) term from the second part. So, the coefficient is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two expressions together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expression will be multiplied by each term in the second expression, but only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 will contribute to the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6*(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6). But that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nSo, to summarize: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by expanding each part separately and then multiplying the relevant coefficients.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), giving the coefficient:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), giving the coefficient:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both expansions:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think that part might affect the coefficient. Hmm, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not involving \\(c\\). So, does that mean I can treat the two parts separately? Like, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and since the second part is multiplied by it, but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps we can consider that the second part doesn't contribute any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. Let me check: the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanded, each term will have powers of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but no \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. Since the second expansion doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is a separate expansion. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient won't be affected by the second part. So, the coefficient remains 6. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients of the terms combine. But in this case, the second polynomial only has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are separate variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when you multiply, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), those multiplications by terms involving \\(c\\) won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, actually, no. Because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, and the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will have all possible coefficients from the second part attached to it. Wait, no, that's not right. Because the second part is multiplied by the entire first part, so each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, let's see: the coefficient from the first part is 6, as we found earlier. The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, that seems plausible. Let me verify. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of the two expansions. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first expansion, and since the second expansion doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be the coefficient from the first expansion times the entire second expansion. But actually, no, because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's 6 times the entire second expansion, which would mean the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that makes sense. Let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 2ab * (c + 1/c), but actually, in this case, there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term, because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by terms in the second expansion, which only have \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Wait, no, in this case, \\((a + b)^2\\) gives \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and when multiplied by \\(c + 1/c\\), you get \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). There is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term here, so the coefficient is 0. Wait, but according to my earlier logic, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of coefficients in the second part. But in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 0, because \\((a + b)^2\\) doesn't have \\(a^2b^2\\). So, 0 times 64 would be 0, which matches the actual result. So, that seems to work. Let me try another example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^3 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). The expansion of \\((a + b)^3\\) is \\(a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b\\) is 3. The second expansion is \\((c + 1/c)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). The sum of coefficients is \\(1 + 2 + 1 = 4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b\\) in the entire product would be 3 * 4 = 12. Let me check by expanding: \\((a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3)(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2)\\). The term \\(3a^2b\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion gives \\(3a^2bc^2 + 6a^2b + 3a^2b/c^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b\\) is indeed 6, not 12. Wait, that contradicts my earlier conclusion. So, my logic must be flawed. Hmm, so in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b\\) in the first part is 3, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 4, but when multiplied, the coefficient of \\(a^2b\\) in the product is 3 * 2 = 6, because the term \\(3a^2b\\) is multiplied by 2 in the second expansion, which is the constant term. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b\\) in the product is 3 * 2 = 6, not 3 * 4 = 12. So, my earlier approach was wrong. Therefore, the correct way is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. Because when you multiply, the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) must cancel out to get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but the problem didn't specify any condition on \\(c\\); it just asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion, because each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. But in my earlier example, that approach gave the wrong result. Wait, in the example, I was looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b\\), and the second expansion's sum of coefficients is 4, but the actual coefficient was 6, which is 3 * 2, where 2 is the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. So, maybe the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, because each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, and the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would have to consider the corresponding term in the second expansion. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Let me check that again with my earlier example. If I have \\((a + b)^3 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), and I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b\\), then the coefficient in the first part is 3, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 4, so 3 * 4 = 12. But when I expanded it, I saw that the coefficient was 6, not 12. So, that suggests that my approach is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the second expansion includes negative exponents, so when multiplied by the first part, the exponents don't interfere, but in reality, the coefficient of \\(a^2b\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b\\) in the first part times the sum of coefficients in the second part, but only considering the constant term, because otherwise, the exponents of \\(c\\) would affect the term. Wait, no, because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so all the terms in the second expansion contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), each multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, in the example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b\\) is 3, and the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 4, so 3 * 4 = 12, but when I expanded, I saw that the coefficient was 6. That suggests that the approach is incorrect. Wait, perhaps because in the second expansion, the terms are \\(c^2\\), 2, and \\(1/c^2\\). So, when you multiply \\(3a^2b\\) by each of these, you get \\(3a^2bc^2\\), \\(6a^2b\\), and \\(3a^2b/c^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b\\) is 6, which is 3 times 2, where 2 is the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. So, perhaps the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is the middle term. So, in the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the total coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but that contradicts my earlier thought. Let me clarify: if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then it's 6 * 64 = 384. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. But in my earlier example, that approach gave the wrong result, which suggests that perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, I'm confused now. Let me try to clarify the problem statement again. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, it's asking for the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, it's the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion. Because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Therefore, in the first part, the coefficient is 6, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. But in my earlier example, that approach didn't work because when I expanded \\((a + b)^3 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b\\) was 6, not 3 * 4 = 12. So, why is that? Because in that case, the second expansion has terms with positive and negative exponents, so when you multiply, the \\(a^2b\\) term is multiplied by \\(c^2\\), 2, and \\(1/c^2\\), giving three terms: \\(3a^2bc^2\\), \\(6a^2b\\), and \\(3a^2b/c^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b\\) is 6, which is 3 * 2, where 2 is the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. So, perhaps the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), giving 6 * 20 = 120. But then, why did I get 384 earlier? It seems like there's a discrepancy. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's the sum of all coefficients for terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But in the example, that approach gave the wrong result because the coefficient of \\(a^2b\\) was 6, not 12, which would be 3 * 4. So, perhaps the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term that has exactly \\(a^2b^2\\) and no \\(c\\) terms. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I'm not sure. Let me look up similar problems to clarify. Typically, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a term in a product of two expressions, it's referring to the term that has exactly those variables with those exponents, regardless of other variables. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would include any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. However, in my earlier example, that approach didn't hold, which suggests that perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so 384. Given that, I think the answer is 384. So, to summarize: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{384}\\)"

Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so when I multiply, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\).

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering all variables together, but since \\(c\\) is separate, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient in the first part, because the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right either because when you multiply, the coefficients get multiplied. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, setting \\(c = 1\\), \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me check that again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part has a coefficient of 6, and it's multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that any \\(c\\) terms would be part of the coefficient. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that since \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's actually a term that is \\(a^2b^2\\) times something involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps the problem is considering only the numerical coefficient, ignoring the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Let's consider the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, which has a coefficient of 6, is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which isn't possible because coefficients are numbers. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the second part, which doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, so the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. In that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6. So, let's try that approach. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the middle term when expanded. Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\), and the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the correct approach. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " That would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) because in the binomial expansion, the exponent of \\(b\\) is \\(k\\), so if \\(k = 2\\), then the exponent of \\(a\\) is \\(4 - 2 = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. Now, the expression also has \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider how this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) is in the second part. So, when I multiply these two expressions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will multiply with terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part evaluated at the terms that don't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, but actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider how many ways \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) such that the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., the product term doesn't have any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\).

So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that we're considering the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, i.e., \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. Because when you multiply, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by \\(c^0\\) from the second part. So, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.

But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is being multiplied by it. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables from \\(c\\), their exponents won't interfere with each other. That means, when I multiply the two expansions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, but actually, no. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider how that term is affected by the multiplication. But actually, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the multiplication by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would just scale the entire term. Wait, that can't be right because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't seem correct either because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product.

So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would actually be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not correct either because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has its own coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), those coefficients would carry over. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times each term in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term, so perhaps I need to consider that when multiplying, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion would contribute its own coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), effectively adding up all the coefficients from the second expansion. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\), which is the sum of the coefficients. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me think differently. Maybe I'm making a mistake here. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and when multiplied by any term from the second part, it becomes \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{term from second expansion}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term from the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too large. Let me verify by another approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term from the second expansion, which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), etc., down to \\(c^{-6}\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's actually the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times that term. So, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Since the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, but let me think again. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times each term in the second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, in the entire product, we're looking for the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), and the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, if I have \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the question is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero. That is, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, let's consider that approach. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply these two coefficients together to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. That makes more sense because the problem is asking for a specific term, likely without any \\(c\\) terms. So, let me proceed with that.\n\nFirst, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier.\n\nNext, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do this, I'll use the binomial theorem again. Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 * 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is the product of the two coefficients I found: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the coefficient was 384, but that was when I considered the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which would give me the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, then it's 120. I think that's the correct approach because it's more likely the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6.\n2. Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20.\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together to get 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check this. Let me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), as I found. So, the term is \\(20c^0\\).\n\nTherefore, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by \\(20c^0\\) from the second expansion, giving \\(6 * 20 a^2b^2c^0 = 120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n$\\boxed{120}$"

The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(c\\) equal to \\(6 - 2m\\). We're looking for the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) which means \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, since when we multiply the two expansions, the terms multiply. So, that would be 6 (from the first part) times 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Let me just double-check that I didn't make any mistakes here. So, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(m = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that seems correct. I don't think I missed anything here. So, yeah, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for each part separately.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   The general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\).

    "text": " That would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) in the expansion, because when \\(k = 2\\), the exponent of \\(a\\) is \\(4 - 2 = 2\\) and the exponent of \\(b\\) is \\(2\\). So, the coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, the expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder if this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, let me think. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\), when I multiply the two expressions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way that term can come up is if we multiply it by the term in the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\), because that way, the \\(c\\) terms won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because when I multiply it by \\(a^2b^2\\), it won't change the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Let me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\cdot c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0. That means \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Let me solve for \\(m\\): \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) \u2192 \\(2m = 6\\) \u2192 \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) will have \\(c^0\\). The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part has a coefficient of 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) from the second part has a coefficient of 20. Since these two terms are multiplied together when we expand the entire expression, their coefficients multiply as well. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me just double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. So, yes, that seems correct.

So, I need to figure out how this part affects the coefficient. Wait, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first part, and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\). So, when we multiply these two parts together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that term doesn't change because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second part is a separate variable. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only affected by the first part, and the terms involving \\(c\\) are only from the second part. So, when you multiply the two expansions, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. However, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to find all the terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). But wait, actually, the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so maybe we just need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, that might be the case. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again.\n\nThe problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, so it's possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems odd. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all terms, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but that might not be the case. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient isn't just a number but a polynomial in \\(c\\). Hmm, perhaps I need to clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit strange because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't seem right either.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is probably not what the problem is asking for. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) is to the power of 0, so that would be the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nWait, that seems more plausible. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me check that. So, if I consider \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that would be 6 multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Alternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But I think it's more likely that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, so that the entire term is \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Let me proceed under that assumption.\n\nSo, first, let me find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we've determined is 6. Next, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the constant term, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part, so 6 (from the first expansion) multiplied by 20 (from the second expansion). That gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me confirm that this is indeed the case. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20. When you multiply these two terms together, you get \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2c^0 = 120 a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\), is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm interpreting the problem correctly. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would result in a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a numerical value, not a polynomial. Therefore, it's more probable that the problem is asking for the coefficient when considering the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the 0 power, making it a constant term. So, the answer would be 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nLet me just recap to make sure I haven't missed anything. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), gives a constant term (where \\(c^0\\)) with coefficient 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. Therefore, the answer should be 120.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me consider if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15\\dfrac{1}{c^2} + 6\\dfrac{1}{c^4} + \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\right)\\). So, that would give a polynomial in \\(c\\) where each term is multiplied by 6. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), I think it's more reasonable to assume that it's asking for the coefficient when \\(c\\) is at its constant term, making the overall term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\), is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\).

Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nNow, the expression we're dealing with is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I think I need to expand this as well, but I'm not sure how it relates to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, maybe I don't need to expand it fully. Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the second part just needs to be evaluated at a specific term, but actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\), maybe the second part can be considered as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Hmm, that might be the case. \n\nWait, let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are separate from the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire expression, which is a product of two polynomials. So, maybe I need to consider that the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is part of the product, and the other part involves \\(c\\) terms. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the \\(c\\) terms are irrelevant, and the coefficient is just 6 times whatever the constant term is in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, that might be the case. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, the resulting term would be \\(a^2b^2\\) times something involving \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that we are looking for the coefficient when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, right? Because if we have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^k\\), then unless \\(k = 0\\), it's not just \\(a^2b^2\\), but \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. \n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero. So, to find that, I need to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nOkay, so let's first find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already did as 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). How do I do that? Let me think. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we have terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, since the original expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is the product of the coefficients we found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\)). So, 6 times 20 is 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the entire expression is the product of two expansions. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from the second expansion. When we multiply these two terms together, we get \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). The coefficient is 6 times 20, which is indeed 120. \n\nBut wait, just to double-check, maybe I should think about it another way. Suppose I consider the entire expansion as a product. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) has terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\). When I multiply them together, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the final product. All other terms will have some power of \\(c\\), so they won't be part of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, that's why I only need to take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. Therefore, 6 times 20 is 120. I think that makes sense. \n\nJust to make sure, let me compute \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) again. 4 choose 2 is 6, correct. And 6 choose 3 is 20, yes. So, 6 times 20 is 120. \n\nI think that's the correct answer. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. But wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that mean I need to consider the entire expansion? Or is the coefficient only from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part? Hmm, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, so when we multiply the two expressions, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with those involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), because the second part doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not a coefficient multiplied by a whole expression. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^n\\), where \\(m + n = 6\\). But the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that would correspond to the term where \\(k = 2\\) in the first part, and any terms in the second part. So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\left(\\text{sum of all terms in } \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\right)\\). But that can't be right because the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. So, perhaps the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems too broad. Wait, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient in front of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has different powers of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each would contribute a different term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), meaning that the coefficient isn't a single number but rather a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, implying a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps I misinterpreted the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, if that's the case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, let me try that approach. First, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), because when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it will give the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, how do I find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the final answer should be 120. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. From \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6. From \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(c^0\\) has a coefficient of 20. Multiplying them gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**  \n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(k = 2\\) in the binomial expansion:  \n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**  \n   We seek the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0.

Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I think I need to consider how this part affects the overall coefficient. Wait, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), so maybe the coefficient from the first part is just multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps I don't need to consider the second part at all because \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\). Wait, that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product of two expansions. So, maybe I need to consider the product of terms from both expansions that result in \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), so when I multiply the two expansions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, but that can't be right because the second part doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. So, actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first expansion, when multiplied by any term from the second expansion, it would result in terms that include \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), but the original problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first part. So, perhaps the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), meaning the coefficient remains 6.\n\nWait, that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, you get a product of two polynomials. Each term in the expansion of the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but none of these would be just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the entire product, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is if the term from the second expansion is a constant term, i.e., \\(c^0\\), because then \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1 = a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient from the first part, which is 6.\n\nSo, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero for the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20. So, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the first part gives me 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part's constant term is 20, so when I multiply these together, I get 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it another way. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the terms in each polynomial that combine to form that term. In this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first polynomial and doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term from the second polynomial. So, that's exactly what I did. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The constant term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."
