    "text": " That would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) in the binomial expansion because when \\(k = 2\\), the exponent of \\(a\\) is \\(4 - 2 = 2\\) and the exponent of \\(b\\) is 2. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. But wait, that's just the first part of the expression. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider the entire product. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, so maybe the \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) parts don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. When I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, and the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables. So, actually, the \\(c\\) terms won't affect the exponent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a single coefficient. Maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the entire expression is a product, so when I multiply the two expansions, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since the variables are different, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with those involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like it would result in a sum of coefficients, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a single coefficient. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term in the expansion will be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the variables are different, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part. However, since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product, but the variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate, so actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too large. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that might not make sense because the entire expression is a product, so each term will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents and \\(c\\) exponents. But the problem is only specifying \\(a^2b^2\\), without any conditions on \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me test that idea. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, if I take the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and multiply it by 64, I get 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that the exponents of \\(c\\) should also be zero. Because otherwise, the coefficient would involve all possible powers of \\(c\\), which would make it a sum. But the problem just says \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying \\(c\\). Hmm. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanded, each term will be of the form \\(a^k b^{4 - k} c^m \\times (1/c)^n\\), where \\(k + (4 - k) = 4\\), and \\(m + n = 6\\). Wait, no, actually, in the second part, each term is \\(c^p\\) and \\((1/c)^q\\) where \\(p + q = 6\\). So, each term in the second expansion is \\(c^{6 - 2q}\\) or something? Wait, no, let me clarify. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in the second expansion has an exponent of \\(c\\) equal to \\(6 - 2m\\), where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the product will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find all terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, and the exponent of \\(c\\) can be anything. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). So, that means I need to sum over all possible exponents of \\(c\\) the coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term from the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second expansion). The sum of coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning that the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. That would require me to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the term in the second expansion where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I'm a bit confused. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). That would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but since it's not specified, I think it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think of it another way. If I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c), then the product P(a, b) * Q(c) would have terms that are products of terms from P and terms from Q. So, the coefficient of a particular term in P, say \\(a^2b^2\\), when multiplied by Q, would be \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in Q. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from P times the entire Q. But that seems like it's not a single coefficient but rather a sum. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think in terms of variables. The expression is a product of two separate expressions, one in variables a and b, and the other in variable c. So, when you multiply them, each term in the product will have a part from the first expression and a part from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first expression, and it's multiplied by the entire second expression. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expression. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in c, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that the exponent of c is zero. That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would involve other variables. So, if that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. To do that, I need to find the term in the first expansion where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs, which is 6, and multiply it by the term in the second expansion where \\(c^0\\) occurs, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. That seems more plausible. Let me verify that. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, when you multiply these two terms together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the answer the problem is looking for. Alternatively, if the problem was just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c, it would be 6 times the entire second expansion, but that would result in a coefficient that's a polynomial in c, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, it's more logical that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   We need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient for this term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients**:\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is the product of the two coefficients found:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " That means, in the binomial expansion, I need the term where \\(a^{2}b^{2}\\). So, the exponent of \\(a\\) is 2, which means \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder if that affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so when I multiply the two expressions, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can treat the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part as a constant coefficient when considering the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Is that right? Let me think. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), we can sum all the coefficients from the second expansion and then multiply by the coefficient from the first part. Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me clarify.\n\nActually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms that multiply together to give that specific term. But in this case, we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but is that accurate?\n\nWait, no, because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\). Let me check that. If I substitute \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients from the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, is the coefficient 384? Wait, but I feel like that might not be correct because perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, let me think again. The original problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). We are to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the expansion, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that approach. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the variables are separate, so \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, while \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are only in the second part. So, when I multiply the two expressions, the variables are independent. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expression. But since we're looking for the coefficient, not the entire term, perhaps it's the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients from the second part, as I thought before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two polynomials, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each part. But since the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), it's just the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part contributes to the coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) first. Let's try that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when I multiply this by \\((a + b)^4\\), which has a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, the entire term in the product will be \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of all its coefficients is indeed 64, as I found by substituting \\(c = 1\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach it differently. Let me consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and since the second part is multiplied by it, the coefficient is 6 times whatever is from the second part. But since the second part is a separate variable, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the entire second expression. But since we're looking for the coefficient, perhaps we can think of it as 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expression, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I think I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the variables are independent, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is simply the coefficient from the first part times the entire second part, but since we're looking for a coefficient, not an expression, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with another approach. Let me compute the product step by step. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) is expanded as \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is expanded as \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15\\dfrac{1}{c^2} + 6\\dfrac{1}{c^4} + \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\). So, when I multiply these two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion. The coefficients in the second expansion are 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1. So, adding those up: 1 + 6 = 7, 7 +15=22, 22+20=42, 42+15=57, 57+6=63, 63+1=64. So, the sum is 64, as I thought before. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part, and since the second part is multiplied by it, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second part, which is 64, so 6*64=384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two polynomials, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think that's correct. So, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with another method. Let me compute the product without separating the variables. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which has coefficients 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1, corresponding to \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, 1, 1/c^2, 1/c^4, 1/c^6\\). So, when I collect all the terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\), their coefficients will be 6 times each of these coefficients. Therefore, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6*(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6*64 = 384.\n\nWait, that seems consistent. So, I think 384 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the problem as two separate parts: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of any term in the second part is the sum of all coefficients, which is 64. Therefore, when multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to think if there's another way. Suppose I just consider the entire expression as a product of two polynomials. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, yes, that's the same as before. So, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check with actual multiplication. Let's take the first part: \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\). Now, when I multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6*1, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 6*6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^2\\) is 6*15, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6*20, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\) is 6*15, and so on. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum all these contributions. So, the total coefficient would be 6*(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6*64 = 384.\n\nWait, that's correct. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because sometimes when you have products of polynomials, you have to consider cross terms, but in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), their exponents don't interfere. So, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, but the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me think if there's another approach. Suppose I use generating functions. The generating function for \\((a + b)^4\\) is such that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. The generating function for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a Laurent polynomial where the sum of coefficients is 64. So, when you multiply these generating functions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the multinomial theorem, but I think that's more complicated. The binomial approach seems sufficient.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and that when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just the product of the coefficients from each part, treating them as independent. So, the coefficient from the first part is 6, and the coefficient from the second part is the sum of all its coefficients, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think 384 is the correct coefficient.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) again. Using the binomial theorem:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficients are:\n\n- For \\(m=0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}=1\\), term is \\(c^6\\)\n- \\(m=1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}=6\\), term is \\(6c^4\\)\n- \\(m=2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}=15\\), term is \\(15c^2\\)\n- \\(m=3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}=20\\), term is \\(20c^0=20\\)\n- \\(m=4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}=15\\), term is \\(15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(m=5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}=6\\), term is \\(6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(m=6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}=1\\), term is \\(c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the coefficients are 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1, which sum up to 1+6=7, 7+15=22, 22+20=42, 42+15=57, 57+6=63, 63+1=64. So, the sum is indeed 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's any alternative interpretation. Suppose the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Then, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120, because that's the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. But the problem is just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, it's 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all the terms in the second expansion, so the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, I think the answer is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2 is \\(a^2b^2\\).

    "text": " That would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) in the binomial expansion, right? Because when \\(k = 2\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^{2}b^{2}\\). So, the coefficient here is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I guess I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but actually, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms? Or do I? Wait, no, because the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, so when you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial will multiply each term in the second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe we can treat the second part as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Let me think. \n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Because the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have multiple terms involving \\(c\\), but the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are only in the first part. So, when we multiply the two expressions, each term from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), we can consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a separate part, so when you multiply by it, you're scaling each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) by all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a bit confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so any term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) would contribute to this coefficient. But since the problem doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), maybe it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems too broad because the coefficients in the second part vary.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, but that's not quite right because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has different powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the resulting term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, but that can't be, because each term in the product will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents and \\(c\\) exponents. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, because each term in the second part is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get terms like \\(6 \\times \\text{(coefficient from second part)} \\times a^2b^2c^k\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), right? Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives the sum of all coefficients. So, let's compute that. When \\(c = 1\\), \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that the exponents of \\(c\\) should also be zero, so that the term is just \\(a^2b^2\\). That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be multiplied by all the terms from the second part, which would give a different result. So, perhaps I misinterpreted the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. If I expand the entire expression, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) ranges based on the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, as I thought earlier. So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, another way to think about it is that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one part is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's the coefficient in the first part times the entire second polynomial. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second polynomial, which when evaluated as a polynomial, is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me compute \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The expansion would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\), as I thought earlier. So, the sum of the coefficients is 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that the exponents of \\(c\\) should be zero. So, in that case, I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, that would be the product of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and the term with \\(c^0\\) from the second part. \n\nSo, let me approach it that way. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as before. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply these two terms together, you get \\(6 \\times \\text{(coefficient of }c^0\\text{ in the second part)} \\times a^2b^2c^0\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, let me compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, as I did earlier, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but now I'm confused because earlier I thought the answer was 384, but now I'm getting 120. Which one is correct? Let me think again. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so it's ambiguous. But in algebra, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\), it's typically implied that you consider the term with those exponents regardless of other variables, which would mean that the coefficient is the sum over all possible exponents of other variables. So, in this case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nBut on the other hand, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. So, perhaps the problem is asking for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), in which case the answer is 384. Alternatively, if it's asking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), the answer is 120. \n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut I'm a bit unsure because in some contexts, when you have multiple variables, the coefficient of a term with some variables is considered without regard to the others, effectively treating the other variables as coefficients. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 64, so 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is from a source that expects a specific answer, perhaps it's 120, assuming that the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. But without more context, it's hard to say. However, given that the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think the intended answer is 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then every term in the expansion that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) will contribute to that coefficient. So, the coefficient is the sum over all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, each multiplied by the corresponding coefficient from the second part. So, the coefficient from the first part is 6, and the second part, when multiplied, will contribute all its terms. So, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nYes, I think that's correct. So, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " That would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) in the binomial expansion, right? Because if \\(k = 2\\), then the exponent of \\(a\\) is \\(4 - 2 = 2\\) and the exponent of \\(b\\) is 2. So, the coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that mean I need to consider the expansion of that part as well? Or is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) independent of that? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think. The expression is a product of two separate binomial expansions: one in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are different variables, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't directly interact with the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it doesn't matter what happens in the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part because that part only affects the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and that's the answer. Wait, but let me double-check that. Because the entire expression is the product of two expansions, when you multiply them out, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we don't care about the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like it would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) has an exponent of 0, because otherwise, the coefficient would be a function of \\(c\\). Let me check the original problem again. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, so maybe it's considering the entire product, and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That is, it's treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a term that includes all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that can't be right because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. That makes more sense because then the coefficient would be a single number. So, maybe I need to consider both parts: the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and find the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. Then, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each expansion for those respective terms. Let me try that approach. So, first, from \\((a + b)^4\\), as I found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), because I want the term where \\(c\\) is to the power of 0, so that when I multiply the two terms together, the exponents of \\(c\\) don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, let me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). I need to find the term where the exponent is 0, so I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that calculation seems a bit off. Let me compute it again. \\(6! = 720\\), \\(3! = 6\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Yeah, that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, since the original expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, that would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm interpreting the problem correctly. The problem says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because the coefficient is usually a scalar, not a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is implicitly asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is written in a way that it's only considering \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the \\(c\\) terms are separate, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6, and the rest is separate. But that seems unlikely because the entire expression includes both parts. Let me think again. If I'm to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is usually a scalar. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean summing over all possible \\(c\\) exponents. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, I think the answer is 120. Let me just confirm that.

    "text": " That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me check: if \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as well. But wait, the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to consider the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) because those are separate variables. So, perhaps the part involving \\(c\\) doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think about that. Since we're multiplying the two expressions together, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that term must come from the product where the first part is \\(a^2b^2\\) and the second part is a constant term (i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out). Wait, but actually, no. Because if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's the coefficient in the entire product. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me calculate that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients we found from each part. That is, 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponents cancel (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) occurs at \\(m = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them together, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. That seems correct. So, I think the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by considering the expansion of each part separately. \n\n1.

So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the expression also has the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, I'm not sure if this affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because that term doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think: The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps we don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. But \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and the second part would contribute terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, unless the second part also has a term that is a constant (like \\(c^0\\)), the product will have terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is a product, so when we expand it, each term will be of the form \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k \\times (1/c)^m\\) or something, but I think the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, actually, perhaps it's considering the entire product, so maybe \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) terms. But I think the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) exponents. So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. Wait, no, that can't be right because the second expansion has different coefficients. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two expressions, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) as we found earlier, with coefficient 6. Now, when we multiply this by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the second expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 6, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that would give the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times every possible power of \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering the entire product and wants the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), because that would be the only term that is purely \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, that might make more sense.\n\nSo, let me clarify: The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, which includes \\(c\\) terms. So, if we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, in that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product.\n\nIf that's the case, then we need to consider both parts. So, from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Now, from the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), because we want \\(c^0\\) in the product to get \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To do that, we can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Now, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product, we multiply the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120, as I calculated earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire product and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 would be 384. But that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any mention of \\(c\\). That suggests that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120, as I found earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering the product as a whole and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But as I thought before, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem wants.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again: The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), ..., down to \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps it's only interested in the constant term, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That would make sense, and that's what I calculated earlier as 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to say \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)\", but it just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, perhaps the answer is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's correct.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is only considering the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But I'm not sure. Let me check.\n\nWait, another approach: The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which has terms like \\(c^k\\) and \\(c^{-k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps it's only interested in the constant term, i.e., the term where \\(c^0\\), which is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire product and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But I think that's not the case because the problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2\\) times any \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps it's just 6 times the constant term in the second expansion, which is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, let me think about this again. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), etc. Each of these terms is then multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times every possible \\(c\\) term. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering all the possible \\(c\\) terms together. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, 6 times 64 is 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 384.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) and I multiply it by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps it's only interested in the constant term, which is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nI'm confused now. Maybe I should look for an alternative approach. Let me consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, another way: The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, each term is a combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each possible \\(c^k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps it's only interested in the constant term, which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Or perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, let me think about the structure of the product. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20c^0\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 times 20, which is 120. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^2\\) is 6 times 15, which is 90, and so on. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), the answer is 120. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion, which is a polynomial. But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check the problem statement again: It just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, perhaps it's considering the product as a polynomial in four variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the monomial \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a number. So, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nI think I've spent enough time thinking about this. I'll go with 120 as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.

So, does that mean I have to consider the expansion of both parts and multiply them together? But I'm only asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, so maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that might not be the case because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. However, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms can be anything because they don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't change regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that right? Let me think again. \n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) would be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms can be anything, because they don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that's not quite right either. Let me clarify.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to think of the entire expression as a product of two separate binomial expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each such multiplication would contribute a term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the product of 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) and the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression 6 * 64 = 384? Hmm, that seems plausible, but let me check again.\n\nWait, no, that might not be correct because the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has terms with different exponents of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term will have a different power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all the coefficients from each term in the second expansion multiplied by 6. But wait, actually, no, that's not right. Because each term in the product will be \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64, as I thought earlier. So, 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient would be 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems off because the variables are separate. Wait, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, but since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't depend on \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) is just the product of the coefficients. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this by another approach. Let's consider the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), has a specific term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). The sum of all coefficients is indeed 64, as when \\(c = 1\\), \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, when you multiply each term in the first expansion by each term in the second expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(15a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(20a^2b^2\\), \\(15a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). Each of these terms has the same \\(a^2b^2\\) part, but different powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second part, which is 64, multiplied by the coefficient from the first part, which is 6. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Sometimes when you have products of polynomials, the coefficients can interfere in ways that aren't just multiplicative, but in this case, since the variables are separate, I think this approach is correct. Alternatively, maybe I should think about it differently. Let me consider the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6a^2b^2, and the second part, when expanded, has a sum of coefficients equal to 64. So, when I multiply 6a^2b^2 by each term in the second expansion, each term will have a coefficient from the second expansion, and the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all terms will be the sum of all those coefficients multiplied by 6. So, 6 times 64 is indeed 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two expansions, and since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are determined solely by the first part, and the exponents of \\(c\\) are determined by the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but to be thorough, maybe I should compute the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and confirm that the sum of its coefficients is 64. Let me do that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be written using the binomial theorem as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{0} = 1\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{1} = 6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{2} = 15\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{4} = 15\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{5} = 6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{6} = 1\\). Adding these up: 1 + 6 = 7, 7 + 15 = 22, 22 + 20 = 42, 42 + 15 = 57, 57 + 6 = 63, 63 + 1 = 64. So, yes, the sum of the coefficients is 64, which confirms that.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my reasoning, let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a^2b^2. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms with coefficients 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1. So, when I multiply 6a^2b^2 by each of these terms, I get 6a^2b^2c^6, 36a^2b^2c^4, 90a^2b^2c^2, 120a^2b^2, 90a^2b^2c^{-2}, 36a^2b^2c^{-4}, 6a^2b^2c^{-6}. Each of these terms has \\(a^2b^2\\) as part of it, but the coefficients in front are different because of the \\(c\\) terms. However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). So, does that mean I need to sum all these coefficients? Because each term has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the sum of all these coefficients, right? Because each term contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in different parts of the expansion.\n\nWait, but that's not correct. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term like \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms in the first polynomial that result in \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by all terms in the second polynomial. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the second part has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because each term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the total coefficient is the sum of all those contributions, which is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused now. Let me clarify: when you have two polynomials, say P(a, b) and Q(c), their product P(a, b) * Q(c) will have terms where each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, if P has a term like 6a^2b^2 and Q has terms like 1c^6, 6c^4, etc., then in the product, you'll have terms like 6a^2b^2c^6, 36a^2b^2c^4, etc. Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). However, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all coefficients from the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, that would be 6*(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6*64 = 384. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of the entire product as a polynomial in four variables a, b, c, and 1/c, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would be the sum over all k of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product being the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part, because the second part is a polynomial in c, so when you multiply, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire second polynomial. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient, not the entire term, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem and properties of polynomial multiplication.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2 is when \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. When multiplying the two polynomials, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " That would happen when \\(a^{2}\\) and \\(b^{2}\\), so in the binomial expansion, that's when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\) and \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). So, solving \\(4 - k = 2\\) gives \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the second part, the multiplication would be between the terms from each part. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), does that mean the coefficient remains 6? Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Because when you multiply the entire expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only comes from the first part, the terms from the second part would involve \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the sum of all terms in the second part. But that would make the coefficient 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not correct because the second part is a Laurent polynomial in \\(c\\), and when we multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is just a single term, so it would be 6 times the sum of all terms in the second expansion. But that can't be right because the second expansion has many terms, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, its coefficient is 6, and when multiplied by the entire second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so it's just the coefficient of that specific term, irrespective of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, when you multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, no, because each term in the product is a combination of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you're effectively scaling it by 6 times each coefficient of the second expansion. But wait, that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me check that. The sum of the coefficients of a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), so it becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but since the second part is a Laurent polynomial, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times each term in the second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient is a single number. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire second expansion. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the second expansion has multiple terms. So, perhaps the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes to the overall product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion. So, as I thought earlier, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. But wait, let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a single number. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, in that case, I need to consider both parts. Let me think about that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) add up to 0. That is, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which is the constant term. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me calculate that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is given by the binomial theorem: \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the constant term is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, that makes more sense. So, perhaps I misread the problem initially, thinking it was just \\(a^2b^2\\), but actually, it's \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so we need to find the coefficient when multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. Therefore, the correct answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

But wait, no, actually, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the part with \\(c\\) might not affect it. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate variables, the exponent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will only come from the first part, and the exponents of \\(c\\) will come from the second part. So, when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the entire second part. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so when we multiply, each term in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we might need to consider the sum over all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second polynomial. Wait, no, that's not right. Actually, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second part, it will still be a term that includes \\(c\\) to some power. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that can't be because the second part is a separate variable. Wait, maybe I'm confusing the problem. Let me re-express the entire expression: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, it's equivalent to multiplying each term of \\((a + b)^4\\) by each term of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think that's not possible because every term in the expansion will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents and some \\(c\\) exponent. Wait, no, that's not correct. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, but the problem is written as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". Hmm, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. That would make sense because otherwise, if you're just looking for \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), it's a bit ambiguous. So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Let me assume that for now. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can proceed as follows. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we've already determined is 6. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply these two coefficients together to get the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, let's compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), so 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (assuming \\(c^0\\)) is 120. Wait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then the answer would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. So, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, in which case the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a single coefficient. So, I think the intended interpretation is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, my final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(c^0\\) (i.e., the constant term) occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both expansions:**\n   The overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is the product of the two coefficients:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " That would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) because \\(a^{4 - 2}b^2 = a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider the entire expression, not just \\((a + b)^4\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which are the variables from the first part. The second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since we're only looking for terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), maybe the second part just contributes a constant factor? Let me think about that. \n\nWhen you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Because each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all terms in the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, but that can't be right because the entire expansion would include multiple terms, but the problem is asking for a specific term \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part? Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term would contribute a coefficient, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a single term, the overall coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nWait, but the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in this expansion would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), because that makes each term equal to its coefficient. So, let me calculate that. If \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Alternatively, maybe I should think about the entire expression as the product of two expansions. So, the first expansion gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and the second expansion is a polynomial in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When I multiply the two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, so each term in the second part contributes a coefficient to the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. But actually, no, because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second part, you just get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would require the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero. So, actually, only the constant term in the second expansion would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Because if you have \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term (which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero), that would give \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant, contributing to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). The other terms would have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so they wouldn't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\). \n\nSo, I think I made a mistake earlier. I should only consider the constant term in the second expansion, not the sum of all coefficients. So, let me correct that. The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the constant term, which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, I can use the binomial theorem again. \n\nThe expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the exponent to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) => \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). \n\nCalculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term in the second expansion is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but now I'm getting 120. Which one is correct? Let me think again. The key is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the first polynomial only has terms with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second polynomial only has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial and the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) in the second polynomial. Because if you take any other term from the second polynomial, it would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) term, which would make the product have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the constant term in the second polynomial contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), which is 120. So, I think my initial mistake was thinking that all coefficients in the second part contribute, but actually, only the constant term does. \n\nTo confirm, let's think about it more carefully. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). When I multiply them, each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in P is multiplied by each term in Q, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where k varies. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are zero. So, only the term where the second polynomial contributes a constant term will result in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nSo, I think the correct answer is 120. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The constant term (where exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. Multiply the two coefficients together: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. I think I was confused earlier by whether the entire sum of coefficients in the second part affects the result, but now I realize only the constant term does. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be found by considering each part separately.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. This happens at \\(m = 3\\), giving the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, but wait a second. Let me think again. Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each factor. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) only appears in the first factor, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second factor, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second factor, each term in the second factor is a multiple of some power of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but the \\(a^2b^2\\) term remains the same.

But that would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every possible term in the second expansion, which would result in \\(a^2b^2\\) being present in the product with a coefficient of 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. So, as I thought earlier, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6 * 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. But wait, let me check this again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the second factor doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), when you expand the entire product, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first factor is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), etc., down to \\(c^{-6}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. As I calculated before, that sum is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, maybe it's considering the entire expression and just wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\). In that case, since the second factor doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second factor, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then it would be different, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think 384 is correct. Let me just verify this with another approach. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. The sum of all coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, yeah, I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in this reasoning.

But in this case, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term only comes from the first polynomial, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second polynomial, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, only \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), perhaps the only way that can happen is if the second part contributes a term that is \\(c^0\\), i.e., a constant term. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term like \\(c^k\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is a different term. So, to get a term with only \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, I need to find two things: 1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found to be 6. 2. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on the second part now. So, I need to expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the two coefficients: 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when you multiply these two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but only the constant term contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product without any \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is found when the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. This corresponds to the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which equals 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   We need the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0). Using the binomial theorem, this term occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), solving for \\(m\\) gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients:**\n   Multiply the coefficient from the first expansion (6) by the constant term from the second expansion (20) to get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider the entire expression, not just \\((a + b)^4\\). Hmm, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, maybe the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables. Wait, is that right? Let me think. When you multiply two expressions, the terms combine, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire second part, because every term in the second part would multiply the terms in the first part. But wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. But in this case, since the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\) and the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms don't interact with the \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient of a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), not \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression, and \\(a^2b^2\\) would be part of a term that also includes \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but no, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second part, which are powers of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would have a coefficient of 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a bit ambiguous. Does it mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), or just the coefficient when multiplied by some \\(c\\) terms? Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include all possible terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any powers of \\(c\\). But that seems complicated because there are infinitely many terms if we consider all possible exponents of \\(c\\). Wait, but actually, the second part is a finite expansion because it's \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so when expanded, it will have terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\), in steps of 2, I think. So, each term in the second expansion is of the form \\(c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is even, from 6 down to -6. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), ..., \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so when you collect like terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, in this case, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the product, each term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is simply 6 times the entire second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so when you collect all terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second expansion). But the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is indeed 64, as I calculated before. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, that is, the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), then we would need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so that the term is \\(a^2b^2 * c^0\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me check that. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the middle term. Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the exponent \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product would be 6 * 20 = 120. But wait, the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I'm confused now. It just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually appear in multiple terms in the product, each multiplied by a different power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, that's 6 * 64 = 384. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. Hmm, maybe I should read the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in the product, every term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) will have some power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire product and treating \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as separate variables, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think of it another way. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then each term in the expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would require \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, for each term where \\(k = 2\\), we have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), because each term contributes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) times \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. That seems to make sense. So, the coefficient is 384. Alternatively, if the problem had specified that it wanted the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) = 6 * 20 = 120. But since it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), without any condition on \\(c\\), it's 384. Wait, but let me make sure. Let me think of a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it's \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The term \\(a^1b^0\\) would be \\(a \\times (c + 1/c)\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be \\(c + 1/c\\). But if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's just \\(c + 1/c\\). But if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a c^0\\), then it's 1. So, in the original problem, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's 6 times the entire second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. Since the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think it's the former, 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is written in a way that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion. But that seems a bit odd because usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term, you're considering all variables. Wait, but in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion has terms with \\(c\\). So, perhaps the correct interpretation is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, which is 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and not considering the second part at all. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes the second part in the expression. So, perhaps I should conclude that the coefficient is 384. But I'm still a bit unsure. Let me try to see if that makes sense. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), etc. Each of these is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), and so on. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so when you collect like terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me check again. If I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) * Q(c) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) multiplied by the entire Q(c), because each term in Q(c) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * Q(c). But Q(c) is a polynomial, so it's not a single number. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * Q(c), which is a polynomial in c. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all terms, which would require summing over all possible c exponents. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in Q(c), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. Since the problem didn't specify, I'm a bit confused. But I think the intended answer is 384, considering that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the c terms. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\). So, when I multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2 is when \\(k = 2\\).

Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I think I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient. Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which are terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The other part of the expression involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are separate variables.

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), but the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. Since the expression is a product of two separate polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms in \\(c\\). So, when we multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, let me make sure.

But wait, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems a bit high. Let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion's sum. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Wait, perhaps another approach: When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, in this case, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a^2b^2, and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it becomes 6a^2b^2 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so that gives 2^6 = 64. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems plausible, but I want to make sure I'm not missing anything. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but the problem only asks for \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by terms in \\(c\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Therefore, I think the coefficient is 384. Let me double-check by calculating the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of coefficients, substitute \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), so that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the entire expression:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\n   \\]\n   The \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\n3. **Find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Substitute \\(c = 1\\) to get the sum of coefficients:\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n4. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " That means I need to find the term where \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part is 6. Now, the expression also has \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder if I need to consider this part as well. Wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which are variables in the first part. The second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so their exponents wouldn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. That is, when we multiply the two expressions together, the \\(c\\) terms would multiply with each term in the first expansion, but since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second part, but wait, no, actually, no. Wait, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. But in this case, we're looking for a specific term in the product. Wait, no, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only come from the first part, because the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. Wait, that makes sense. So, the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms at all. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs, and that term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not quite right. Because when you multiply, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), we need to find the term in the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\), because only then will the product of the two terms not involve \\(c\\), so that the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, meaning \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, actually, I think I need to consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), because when we multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion and the \\(c^0\\) term in the second expansion. Therefore, the overall coefficient would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, I need to calculate the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me do that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from the second expansion. When you multiply them together, you get \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0 = a^2b^2\\), which is the term we're interested in. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's the correct answer. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\)). This coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiply the two coefficients: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " That would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) in the binomial expansion because \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\) would be \\(a^{4 - 2}b^2 = a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient for this term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), for the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to consider the terms involving \\(c\\) because they won't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the same as the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by whatever the coefficient is for the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) in the second part. But wait, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term will have some power of \\(c\\) and some power of \\(1/c\\). But since we're only interested in the terms that don't involve \\(c\\), we need to find the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) add up to zero. Because any term with \\(c\\) raised to a positive or negative power won't be a constant term. So, let's think about that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\cdot c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) will be the constant term. The coefficient for this term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term in the second part is 20. Therefore, when we multiply the two parts together, \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in the second part). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, for the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed when \\(k = 2\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term occurs when \\(m = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120.

Hmm, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), while the second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply the two expansions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are different variables, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is when we take the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and multiply it by the constant term (if any) from the second expansion. Wait, but the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in this expansion has an exponent of \\(c\\) that is \\(6 - 2m\\). Now, when I multiply the two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) for each \\(m\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but if I'm considering the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then each term in the product will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents and \\(c\\) exponents. But the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean I'm looking for all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, and then sum their coefficients? Wait, but that might not be the case because the problem is phrased as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which could imply considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, each multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we need to consider the coefficient when \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion, and then sum those coefficients. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first expansion. Wait, that might make sense. Let me think again. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), gives a coefficient of 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms with various powers of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) (for various \\(k\\)) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible \\(c\\) terms. But that might not make sense because \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate variables. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, no, because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, so when multiplied by 6, each term would contribute to different terms in the product. But I think I need to clarify what exactly the problem is asking for. It says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". So, perhaps it's considering \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That is, the coefficient would be the sum of all terms where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which, when expanded, has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which would make each term equal to its coefficient. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems a bit high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But maybe I should think differently. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would require considering all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the constant term in the second expansion. Wait, the constant term in the second expansion occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that seems more reasonable. Wait, so which is it? Let me think again. The problem says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". So, perhaps it's considering \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But alternatively, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any \\(c^k\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of each \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion, but that would result in multiple terms. Wait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion. So, that would be 6 times the entire second expansion, meaning that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term, so the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to approach this differently. The original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m \\times a^lb^{4 - l}c^n\\), but wait, no, actually, the first part is only in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part is only in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term will be \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from -6 to 6 in steps of 2. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(k = 2\\) in the first expansion, which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). Then, when you multiply this by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you get \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(\\text{each term in the second expansion}\\right)\\). So, each term in the product will be \\(6a^2b^2c^m\\), where \\(m\\) is the exponent from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^m\\) is \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m/2}\\) if \\(m\\) is even, and 0 otherwise. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think implies considering all possible exponents of \\(c\\). But that's not possible because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a single term, and when multiplied by \\(c^m\\), it becomes a different term. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible exponents of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a numerical value, not a polynomial. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire product as a polynomial, but that's not standard. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is raised to some power. But since the problem doesn't specify a particular power of \\(c\\), it's ambiguous. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. As I calculated earlier, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the constant term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but in the problem statement, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, perhaps the intended interpretation is that we are to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would require considering all possible \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial, but that's not a single coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion, which is 6, and then, since the second expansion is multiplied by that, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire second expansion. But that seems odd because the problem is asking for a single coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. Let me think about how the problem is phrased. It says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". So, perhaps it's considering the entire product as a polynomial in variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and we're to find the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. I'm a bit torn between these two interpretations. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)?\" Since the problem doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), perhaps it's considering all possible powers, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term, which would be 6 * 20 = 120. I think the more likely interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about it another way. If I were to set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Then, the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. That seems to make sense. Alternatively, if I set \\(c = 1\\), I'm essentially summing all the coefficients of the second expansion. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct answer. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " That means I need the term where \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), so \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as well. But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Does that mean I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\)? Or do I need to consider how they interact? Hmm, actually, since the expression is a product of two separate polynomials, \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms in each are independent. That means when I multiply them, the variables from each part multiply together. So, for example, a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will multiply each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term is only present in the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, and the other part only affects the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Therefore, when I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can treat the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part as just a constant multiplier, because I'm only interested in the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2. \n\nWait, let me make sure I'm understanding this correctly. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that means I'm only concerned with the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the terms where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) have exponents 2, the other variables \\(c\\) can have any exponent, but they don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that when I multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all the terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). But in reality, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is being multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the total coefficient would be the product of the two coefficients.\n\nWait, but that might not be correct. Let me clarify. Let's denote \\(A = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(B = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the product is \\(A \\times B\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A \\times B\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\). Because when you multiply \\(A\\) by \\(B\\), each term in \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(B\\), which includes terms with different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\(A \\times B\\) is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(B\\). \n\nBut wait, is that correct? Let me think of a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)(c + d)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product is 1 (from \\(a \\times c\\)) plus 1 (from \\(a \\times d\\)), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) is also 2. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial. So, yes, that seems to be the case. Therefore, applying that logic, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial, you can substitute \\(c = 1\\), because that makes each term equal to its coefficient. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which has 7 terms (from exponent 6 down to -6). But since we're only interested in the coefficient, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, each of these multiplications contributes a coefficient, so the total coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, leading to 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that there isn't a different interpretation. Suppose someone thinks that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) is also raised to the 0 power. Then, in that case, we would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product. But the problem just says \\(a^2b^2\\), so it's ambiguous whether it's considering terms with any power of \\(c\\) or specifically \\(c^0\\). Hmm, that's a good point. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's considering all possible terms where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) have exponents 2, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had specified \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would need to find the coefficient where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^k\\). But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's safe to assume that we're considering all terms where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) have exponents 2, regardless of \\(c\\)'s exponent. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If the problem had said \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)\", then we would have to find the specific term where \\(c\\) is also raised to 0. In that case, we would have to compute the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem doesn't specify \\(c^0\\), I think the intended interpretation is that we're only concerned with the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and not with \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me consider the expansion of the entire expression. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, each of these terms contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the total coefficient is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I'm not missing anything. For example, if I expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) separately, then multiply them together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Each of these terms has a coefficient, so the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all these products. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, the total coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nAlternatively, if I wanted to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), I would have to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), because to get \\(c^0\\), you need 3 terms of \\(c\\) and 3 terms of \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120. But the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I think 384 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me check this with an example. Let's take smaller exponents to see if my reasoning holds. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^1\\) in the first part is \\(\\dbinom{2}{1} = 2\\). The sum of coefficients in the second part is \\(2\\) (since \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\), and substituting \\(c=1\\) gives 2). So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^1\\) in the product would be \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\). Let's expand it manually: \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\). Multiplying them together, we get \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). Now, the term \\(ab\\) is present in the product as \\(2abc\\) and \\(2ab/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is \\(2c + 2/c\\). But if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(ab\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's \\(2c + 2/c\\), but that's not a constant. Wait, that seems contradictory to my earlier reasoning.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the terms. In the product, each term has both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents and \\(c\\) exponents. So, when I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^1\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's actually the sum of all terms where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) have exponents 1, multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But in reality, each term in the product will have specific exponents for \\(c\\). So, in the example, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^1c^1\\) is 2, and the coefficient of \\(a^1b^1c^{-1}\\) is also 2. So, the total coefficient of \\(a^1b^1\\) across all powers of \\(c\\) is \\(2 + 2 = 4\\), which matches my earlier calculation of 2 (from \\((a + b)^2\\)) times 2 (sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\)) equals 4. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^1\\) regardless of \\(c\\) is indeed 4. Therefore, my reasoning seems to hold.\n\nSo, applying that to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384. Therefore, the answer should be 384.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think about another example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the first part is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Let's expand it: \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The terms with \\(a^1\\) are \\(a c\\) and \\(a/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^1\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), but if we're considering the sum of coefficients regardless of \\(c\\), it's 1 + 1 = 2, which matches the product of 1 * 2. So, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, going back to the original problem, I think my reasoning is correct. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me also compute the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) another way to confirm. The sum of coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Alternatively, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The sum of coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), and the sum is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\), which confirms my earlier result.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning now. So, the final answer should be 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem and properties of polynomial multiplication.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2 is when \\(k = 2\\).

    "text": " That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. Now, the expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, actually, no. Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), right? So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the variables are all separate. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire second part. Wait, no, that can't be right. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would come from the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would have a coefficient, so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times any term would be 6 times each coefficient in the second expression. But wait, actually, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2\\) times anything else. Wait, no, because the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second expression. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a numerical factor, not a polynomial. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps they are treating \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) as separate variables, and they are looking for the coefficient of the monomial \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of those would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times that power of \\(c\\). But if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then perhaps it's just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems odd because usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term in a product, you might be considering all terms, but here it's a bit ambiguous. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients, which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 384. But that seems high. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then since the second part is multiplied by it, the overall coefficient is 6 times whatever the coefficient is in the second part for the constant term. Wait, because if you have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by something, and you want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps only the term where the second part is a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by 6 to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That sounds more reasonable. Let me try that approach. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I found earlier. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(c^0\\) would be the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) add up to zero. So, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, that seems plausible. Let me check that again. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, when you multiply these two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term from the second part, giving \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. That makes sense because any other term in the second part would have a power of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would result in a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is non-zero, which isn't what we want. Therefore, only the constant term contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " That would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) in the binomial expansion because when \\(k = 2\\), the exponent of \\(b\\) is 2, and the exponent of \\(a\\) would be \\(4 - 2 = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is equal to \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient I just found, 6, is part of the first part. The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The \\(c\\) terms are separate, so I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second part, because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But wait, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the \\(c\\) terms are separate, maybe the coefficient doesn't depend on \\(c\\) at all? Hmm, that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, because when you multiply the two expressions, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that can't be right. Because in the entire expression, each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which are terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, that's not correct either. Wait, let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire expression, which includes \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the problem is considering all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that might not be the case. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, no, because in the product, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, that doesn't sound right. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which are terms like \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\) will have coefficients. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of a larger term that includes \\(c\\) to some power. So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), because that's the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can stand alone without any \\(c\\) terms. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so it's just the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, that might make sense. Let me think: if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) which gives me terms with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) which gives me terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When I multiply these two expansions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in the second part is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient be 6 * 64 = 384? Wait, that seems high. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, I would need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the only term that would contribute to \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, let me approach it that way.\n\nFirst, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already determined is 6. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, let's expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 * 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the answer should be 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, the first part gives me 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives me 20 for \\(c^0\\). Multiplying them together gives 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384, but that seems unlikely because the problem probably wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\). So, I think 120 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720/(6*6) is 720/36, which is indeed 20. And 4 choose 2 is 6. So, 6 * 20 is 120. Yeah, that seems right. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, then multiplying them together.\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. This occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiply the two coefficients: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{120}\\)"
