    "text": " So, each term has an exponent of \\(6 - 2m\\). We're looking for the term where the exponent is 0, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) and solve for \\(m\\). \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) implies \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the other part is 20. Since these two terms are multiplied together in the product, the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, is that right? Let me double-check. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, correct. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), correct. So, when I multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, giving 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120. I think that makes sense. Let me see if there's another way to approach this, just to confirm. Alternatively, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can treat the second factor as a constant when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right because the second factor isn't a constant; it's another polynomial. But since we're looking for a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), we have to take the constant term from the second polynomial and multiply it by the coefficient from the first polynomial. So, that's consistent with what I did earlier. Therefore, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part.
