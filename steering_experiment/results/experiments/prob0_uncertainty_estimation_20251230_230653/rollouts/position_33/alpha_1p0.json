    "text": " Because \\(\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = c^{-m}\\), so when you multiply \\(c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m}\\), you get \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the constant term. The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients I found: 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) and 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, multiplying them together: 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when I multiply these two terms together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and the constant term from the second part, I get \\(6 * 20 = 120\\). That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the entire expression is the product of the two expansions, so each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part and the \\(c^0\\) term in the second part, because any other term from the second part would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, which would make the product have a \\(c\\) term, which isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's the right answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and the \\(c^0\\) term from the second expansion. The coefficients are 6 and 20, so their product is 120. Yeah, that makes sense. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) here is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   We need the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0).

Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients I found: 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) and 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, multiplying them together: 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, correct. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) which is 20. So, when you multiply these two, it's 6*20=120. Hmm, that seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations. So, I think the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"
