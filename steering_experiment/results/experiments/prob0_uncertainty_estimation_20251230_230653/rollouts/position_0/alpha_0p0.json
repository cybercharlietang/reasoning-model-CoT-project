    "text": " Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So maybe I can apply that here.\n\nIn this case, the expression is \\((a + b)^4\\), so \\(n = 4\\). I need to find the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need the term where the power of \\(a\\) is 2 and the power of \\(b\\) is also 2. So, looking at the binomial theorem, when \\(k = 2\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{4 - 2} b^2\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), I know that \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} = \\dfrac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\\). So plugging in the numbers: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the expression also has another part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder if I need to consider this part as well. Wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The term \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so unless there's a cross term or something, I think the coefficients for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the \\(c\\) terms.\n\nBut let me think again. When you multiply two expressions together, the coefficients multiply as well. So if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with those involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the product would have terms with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\) for various \\(k\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would actually be zero because the other terms involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Wait, that can't be right.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you expand the entire expression, how many times does \\(a^2b^2\\) appear, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\)?\n\nIf that's the case, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in the other expansion. But since we're only interested in the terms where the power of \\(a\\) is 2 and the power of \\(b\\) is 2, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient being 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of coefficients in the other part, which is 64. So 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. In that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6. So let's check that.\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\cdot (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, so which interpretation is correct? The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". In algebra, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term in a product of expressions, it usually means the coefficient of that term regardless of other variables. But in this case, since \\(c\\) is another variable, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be part of a larger term that includes \\(c\\) raised to some power. So, unless specified, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that might not make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it would have coefficients multiplied by the terms in the second part. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which isn't a single number. So perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is written as a single expression, so \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and when expanded, it's a product of two polynomials. So the terms would be products of terms from each polynomial. So, for example, a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial would be multiplied by each term from the second polynomial, which are terms involving \\(c^k\\) and \\(c^{-k}\\). So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But that would make the coefficient 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought earlier.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused because usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term in a product, you have to consider the variables involved. So if the term is \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other expression involves \\(c\\), then unless \\(c\\) is also part of the term you're looking for, the coefficient would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). But if the term is \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient is 6 times the sum of coefficients of the second expression, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6*20=120, as I calculated earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So it's only asking about \\(a^2b^2\\), without any mention of \\(c\\). So, in the entire expansion, how many times does \\(a^2b^2\\) appear, regardless of the power of \\(c\\)? So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nBut let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to terms involving \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, 1, 1/c^2, 1/c^4, 1/c^6\\). So when I multiply these two, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, for example, \\(a^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the second, giving \\(a^4c^6\\), \\(a^4c^4\\), etc. Similarly, \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, giving \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2/c^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2/c^4\\), \\(6a^2b^2/c^6\\). So, in the entire expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (without considering \\(c\\)) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial multiplies \\(6a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second polynomial. But if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is \\(a^2b^2\\), then it's 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, which is 6*20=120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check some references or think of similar problems.\n\nIn standard problems, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term in a product of two polynomials, unless specified, it's usually the coefficient of that exact term, considering all variables. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the first polynomial, and the second polynomial is in \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be part of terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would include all possible coefficients from the second polynomial. So, I think the correct approach is to take the coefficient from the first part and multiply it by the sum of coefficients from the second part.\n\nSo, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the sum of coefficients is when \\(c=1\\), which is \\(2^6=64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6*64=384.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). Then, the product P(a, b)*Q(c) would have terms like P(a, b)*Q(c), so each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P times the sum of coefficients in Q, because each term in Q is a coefficient times a power of c, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient times c^k. So, if you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c, it's the sum of all coefficients from Q multiplied by the coefficient from P. So, 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, if you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6*20=120.\n\nBut the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so I think it's the former, 384. But I'm still a bit unsure because sometimes problems specify if they want a term independent of other variables. Since it's not specified, I think 384 is the answer.\n\nWait, let me try to think differently. Suppose I expand the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from the first part, and it would be multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nYes, I think that's correct. So the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " Hmm, that seems a bit involved, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with expressions raised to a power, the binomial theorem is really useful. The binomial theorem states that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^k\\). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLooking at the expression, it's a product of two binomials raised to different powers: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, maybe I should handle each part separately and then see how they combine.\n\nStarting with \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this would expand to:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n\\]\n\nI need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, in the binomial expansion, \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\) and \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, looking at the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, this expands to:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the terms, \\(\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = c^{-m}\\), so the exponent of \\(c\\) becomes \\(6 - m - m = 6 - 2m\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, hold on, the first part is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\). So, when we multiply these two expansions together, the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all independent. That means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be the product of the coefficients from each expansion, multiplied by the corresponding terms in the other expansion that don't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\nWait, no, actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second part, the variables are separate. So, when we multiply the two expansions, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will multiply the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can treat the \\(c\\) terms separately because they don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\).\n\nWait, that might not be entirely accurate. Let me think again. The entire expression is a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in \\(c\\). So, when you expand the product, each term will be of the form (term from first expansion) * (term from second expansion). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply by any term from the second expansion, it just gets multiplied by the coefficient from the first part.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct either. Actually, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first expansion, and when multiplied by any term from the second expansion, it will result in a term like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) or something similar. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). Wait, I'm getting confused here.\n\nLet me clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is a product of two expressions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), because the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. Therefore, when you multiply the two expansions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would make the coefficient a sum of terms, each involving different powers of \\(c\\). Wait, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the question is asking for a numerical coefficient. Hmm, perhaps I misread the problem.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, when you multiply the two expansions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, which are in terms of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would make the coefficient a sum involving \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because we're looking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but we just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), irrespective of what power of \\(c\\) it's multiplied by. In that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would result in a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a single coefficient. Hmm, I'm confused.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present in the product, and its coefficient will be the product of the coefficients from each part. But since the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that can't be right because the second expansion is a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\).\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number, which contradicts the question's wording.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let's think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's just the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient remains 6. But that seems too simple, and I might be missing something.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, so when you multiply them, the coefficients of each term in the first polynomial get multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes its coefficient to the product, and since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we have to sum all those contributions.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), and since we're collecting all terms where the product has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) power, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part.\n\nBut wait, no, actually, the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and its expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term will have a different power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that still doesn't make sense because the coefficient is a polynomial.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which contradicts the question's wording because it's asking for a coefficient, which is a number.\n\nI think I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), and since we're summing over all possible powers of \\(c\\), the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nBut wait, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, let's compute that. The second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Setting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, that seems plausible. Let me check that again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, when you multiply the two polynomials, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. That makes sense because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), and since we're considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), the total contribution is the sum of all coefficients in the second part multiplied by the coefficient from the first part.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. In this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term from the second polynomial will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) and contribute its coefficient. Therefore, the total coefficient is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nSo, to confirm, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is to consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I expand both parts separately and then multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear in the first part with coefficient 6, and it will be multiplied by every term in the second part. So, each term in the second part has a coefficient, say, \\(k\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(6k a^2b^2 \\times c^m\\), where \\(m\\) is the exponent of \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the total coefficient would be the sum of all \\(6k\\) for each term in the second part. Therefore, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to compute the entire expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, I think the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2} b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients of all terms in this expansion can be found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   Since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6 and the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that when dealing with expressions raised to a power, the binomial theorem is super useful. The binomial theorem says that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^{k}\\). So, maybe I can apply this theorem to both parts of the given expression: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term is only present in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), right? Because the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply the two expansions together, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms won't be affected by the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) part when looking for \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, that makes sense.\n\nSo, let me focus on expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) first. Using the binomial theorem, the expansion will be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\n\\]\n\nI need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part is 6.\n\nNow, considering the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when I multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will multiply each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient from the \\(c\\) part doesn't affect it. Wait, is that right? Let me make sure.\n\nWhen I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion. But the problem just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, so does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Or do I need to consider something else?\n\nWait, no, I think I'm overcomplicating it. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is only influenced by the part of the expression that contains \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Since the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), when you multiply, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the \\(c\\) part. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the \\(c\\) terms are separate.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of it differently. When you have two independent expansions multiplied together, the coefficients for the variables in one part don't affect the other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think it's just 6 times whatever the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire expression, that term will be multiplied by each term from the \\(c\\) expansion. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut wait, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but is that correct? Let me think again. If I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c), then the product P(a, b) * Q(c) will have terms where each term of P is multiplied by each term of Q. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) multiplied by the entire sum of Q(c), because each term in Q(c) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, let me verify this with a smaller example to make sure I'm not making a mistake. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 2 * (c + 1/c). But in this case, there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term because the first expansion only goes up to \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\), and the second expansion is degree 1 in c. Wait, maybe my small example isn't the best.\n\nAlternatively, consider \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, it's \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 1 * (c + 1/c), and similarly for \\(b\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is indeed (c + 1/c). So, scaling up, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of the entire expression as a product, and when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because when you multiply, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nBut let me make sure. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when we set \\(c = 1\\), so as I did before, that's 2^6 = 64. So, yes, the coefficient would be 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the entire expression is a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for some \\(k\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's the sum over all possible \\(k\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But that would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times ( \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} ) = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So that confirms it.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to compute the entire expansion, I could think that each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(c\\), but since we're just looking for the coefficient, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 64, so 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think of the product as a single expression, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64. So, 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but let me check with another approach. Let's compute the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply this by \\((a + b)^4\\), which has a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, the product will have terms like \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for all \\(k\\) from 0 to 6, because each term in the \\(c\\) expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nBut the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) from \\(k=0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\), so the coefficient is 6*64=384.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the product of the two expansions, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present only in the first part, so its coefficient is 6 times the entire sum of the second expansion's coefficients, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there a possibility that the \\(c\\) terms could somehow interact with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms? I don't think so, because they're separate variables. So, when multiplying, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but the variables are independent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, yes, I think 384 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) another way. The sum of coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\nSo, that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to write out the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times each term in the \\(c\\) expansion, so when you sum all those up, it's 6*64=384.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   Since each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from the \\(c\\) expansion (which is 64):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

So, maybe I can apply this theorem to both parts of the given expression separately.\n\nLet me start with the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this can be expanded as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). I need the term where the exponents of both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, which means \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I should find the value of \\(k\\) such that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). That makes sense because \\(4 - 2 = 2\\), so the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2 b^2\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is the number of ways to choose 2 items from 4, that's \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, this would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nHmm, so each term in this expansion has an exponent of \\(c\\) that depends on \\(m\\). But wait, in the original problem, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), so I think the \\(c\\) terms will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I need to consider how the entire expression is multiplied together.\n\nWait, actually, the expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand both, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps we need to find the term in the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\), because \\(c^0 = 1\\), which won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.\n\nSo, in the second expansion, I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That is, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(2m = 6\\), which means \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) will have \\(c^0\\), which is 1. The coefficient for this term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), that's \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient for the \\(c^0\\) term is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original expression, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term (which is 1) from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, in the first part, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in the second part, the coefficient for \\(c^0\\) is 20. Since these two terms are multiplied together, their coefficients multiply as well, giving 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about it differently. The entire expression is a product of two expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all possible products where the terms from the first expansion multiply to give \\(a^2b^2\\), and the terms from the second expansion multiply to give a term that doesn't affect \\(a^2b^2\\), i.e., a constant term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the second part contributes a constant, the coefficient is simply the product of the two coefficients.\n\nYes, that makes sense.

But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second part multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. Wait, no, that's not right because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's not correct either.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, they want the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, I'm looking for all terms in the expansion where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), and I need the sum of the coefficients of all those terms.\n\nSo, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each contributing a different power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nBut wait, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), right? Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives the sum of all coefficients. So, let me calculate that.\n\nFirst, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression just \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\)?\n\nWait, that seems too straightforward. Let me verify.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nBut let me think again. When you have two separate variables, the coefficients are independent, right? So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each contributing their own coefficient. Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all terms involving \\(c\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nSo, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\( (1 + 1)^6 = 64 \\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's correct because the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has terms with both positive and negative exponents of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the coefficients of these terms would still be the same as the coefficients in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), has a certain expansion, and each term in that expansion is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\). So, when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of those terms becomes \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), each with their own coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first part.\n\nBut actually, no, because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion, but that's not quite right because the second expansion is a sum of terms, each with their own coefficients. So, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times each term in the second expansion, but since we're looking for the coefficient regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum all those coefficients.\n\nWait, but that's not correct because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion, but since the second expansion is a sum, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think of it as two separate polynomials. The first is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables are independent, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's in a different variable. But that can't be right because the second part is being multiplied, so each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, leading to cross terms.\n\nWait, no. Actually, when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all terms in the other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nSo, the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64, as I calculated earlier. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me try another approach. Let me expand both parts separately and see.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that. Using the binomial theorem, it's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\cdot (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, the terms are:\n\n- \\(k=0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0} c^6 = 1 \\cdot c^6\\)\n- \\(k=1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1} c^4 = 6c^4\\)\n- \\(k=2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2} c^2 = 15c^2\\)\n- \\(k=3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\\)\n- \\(k=4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4} c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(k=5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5} c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(k=6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6} c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the coefficients are 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1. The sum of these coefficients is 1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64, which matches what I found earlier.\n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first, which is \\(6a^2b^2\\), is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\).\n\nSo, the resulting terms would be:\n\n- \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 6c^4 = 36a^2b^2c^4\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 15c^2 = 90a^2b^2c^2\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 120a^2b^2\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 15c^{-2} = 90a^2b^2c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 6c^{-4} = 36a^2b^2c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times c^{-6} = 6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\)\n\nNow, each of these terms has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(120a^2b^2\\) is the one where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, but actually, all the terms have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, the term \\(120a^2b^2\\) is the only term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, so it's the only term that is purely \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. But wait, no, that's not correct because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which includes all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\). So, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But when I look at the expanded terms, the only term with \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is 120a^2b^2, which comes from multiplying \\(6a^2b^2\\) by 20. So, that's just 6*20=120. But that contradicts my earlier conclusion. So, where am I going wrong?\n\nWait, no. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, there are multiple terms with \\(a^2b^2\\), each multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. So, each term in the second expansion contributes a term with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), each with their own coefficients. Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all terms is 6*(sum of coefficients in the second expansion). Since the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, the total coefficient is 6*64=384.\n\nBut wait, when I look at the expanded terms, each term has a different power of \\(c\\), so each term's coefficient is 6 multiplied by the corresponding coefficient from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6*1=6, \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 6*6=36, \\(a^2b^2c^2\\) is 6*15=90, \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6*20=120, \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\) is 6*15=90, \\(a^2b^2c^{-4}\\) is 6*6=36, and \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\) is 6*1=6.\n\nSo, each of these terms has a coefficient, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in all these terms, each multiplied by a different power of \\(c\\). So, does the problem mean the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, which would be 120, or does it mean the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\), which would be 6+36+90+120+90+36+6= 384?\n\nI think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so it's the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, which would be 384.\n\nBut let me check the wording again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so it's the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the answer should be 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I first thought about it, I considered that the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, leading to 384. But when I look at the expanded terms, each term has a different power of \\(c\\), so each term's coefficient is 6 times the corresponding coefficient from the second expansion. Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all terms is indeed 6*64=384.\n\nSo, after all that, I think the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the binomial expansion of each part. The coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when dealing with binomial expansions, each term can be found using the binomial theorem. So maybe I should expand both parts separately and then multiply them together, but that sounds like a lot of work. Wait, but I only need the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I don't have to expand everything.\n\nLet me start by recalling the binomial theorem. The expansion of \\((x + y)^n\\) is the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(n\\) of \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^k\\). So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion will have terms like \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, right? So that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me check: if \\(k = 2\\), then the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2} b^{2}\\). The coefficient here is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the expansion of this as well, but again, maybe I don't need the entire expansion. Wait, but since I'm multiplying the two expansions together, I need to consider how the terms from each expansion will combine to give me a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, actually, wait a second. The first part is only in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So when I multiply them together, the variables are separate. That means the terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with the terms in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part, right? Because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm thinking correctly. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) which gives me terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\), and then I have \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) which will give me terms in \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^5\\), \\(15c^4\\), etc., all the way down to \\(c^{-6}\\). When I multiply these two together, each term from the first expansion gets multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the product will have terms like \\(a^4c^6\\), \\(4a^3bc^5\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Now, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion. Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^5\\), etc., but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be \\(6\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that can't be right because the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, setting \\(c = 1\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Hmm, that seems high. Let me check if I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of those involving \\(c\\). Therefore, when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's sufficient to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think differently. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but no, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, so 384.\n\nBut let me check this another way. Let me consider that when I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms with different powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and when I expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I get terms with different powers of \\(c\\). When I multiply them together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^5\\), \\(15c^4\\), etc., down to \\(c^{-6}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. Since the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this by looking at a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion of \\((a + b)^2\\) is \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and the expansion of \\((c + 1/c)\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\). Now, if I multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be 1 (from \\(a^2\\)) multiplied by each term in \\((c + 1/c)\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product would be \\(1 \\times (1 + 1) = 2\\), because the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\) is 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2 times 2, which is 4, and the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) would be 1 times 2, which is 2. So, that seems to work. So, applying the same logic, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so perhaps I'm overcomplicating it by including the \\(c\\) terms. But no, because the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so each term in the expansion will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then I'm correct that it's 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the term where the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out, but the problem just says \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think it's regardless of \\(c\\). So, I think 384 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me check with another approach. Let me compute the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) separately and then see how they multiply.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\) as I did before has the term \\(6a^2b^2\\).\n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, the expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply this by \\(6a^2b^2\\), I get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(120a^2b^2\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), and \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is the term \\(120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, hold on! This contradicts my earlier conclusion of 384. So, where did I go wrong?\n\nLet me see. I think I made a mistake earlier by assuming that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But actually, when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (i.e., when \\(c^0\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\)). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, the second expansion \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient for this term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, when I multiply by \\(6a^2b^2\\), the coefficient becomes \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, so my initial approach was wrong because I thought the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients, but that's not the case. Instead, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120.\n\nLet me confirm this by considering the expansions again. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(6a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives a term \\(20c^0\\). So, when multiplied together, the term is \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2c^0 = 120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, so where did I go wrong earlier? I think I confused the problem by considering all coefficients, but actually, only the term where \\(c\\) cancels out (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, the correct coefficient is 120.\n\nLet me think again. So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the product will have terms like \\(a^k b^{4 - k} c^{6 - 2m}\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. But when we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we're only interested in the terms where \\(k = 2\\), \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\), and the exponent of \\(c\\) can be anything because the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, actually, the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nBut then, in the second approach, I considered that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120, which is different. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify the problem statement. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of the monomial \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) because \\(a^2b^2\\) is equivalent to \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, in that case, the coefficient is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it would be 384. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's more likely that it's referring to the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, so the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut then, when I did the term-by-term multiplication, I saw that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would indeed be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nBut then, when I considered the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), I got 120. So, which interpretation is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120, but if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 384. But the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without mentioning \\(c\\), so I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, I think the correct answer is 120.\n\nWait, but I'm getting conflicting results here. Let me think again. The problem is: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, when we multiply two polynomials, the resulting terms are products of terms from each polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term from the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial, each multiplied by 6. Because each term \\(a^2b^2c^{k}\\) has a coefficient of \\(6 \\times\\) the coefficient of \\(c^{k}\\) in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum over all \\(k\\) of \\(6 \\times\\) coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But that sum is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that would be the case if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem is ambiguous, but given the way it's written, I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nWait, let me think again. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". In the context of polynomial expressions, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term, it's usually referring to the term where the variables match exactly, including all variables. So, in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) would imply that the term also has \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, it's \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nBut then, in that case, the answer would be 120, but earlier I thought it was 384. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me check this with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)\\). The expansion is \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\), which is 2, so 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2 times 2, which is 4, and the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) would be 1 times 2, which is 2. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 2, which includes all the terms \\(a^2c\\) and \\(a^2c^{-1}\\). So, in that case, the problem would be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which is 2. Similarly, in the original problem, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nBut if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 120. So, perhaps the problem is ambiguous, but I think in the context of the problem, it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so 384.\n\nWait, but in the earlier example, when I considered \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 2, which is the sum of coefficients in the second expansion times the coefficient from the first expansion. So, applying that logic, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in the second approach where I considered \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), I got 120. So, I'm confused now. Let me try to clarify.\n\nI think the key is to understand whether the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), or the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Since the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think it's the former, so 384. But in the expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present when multiplied by \\(c^0\\), so perhaps the problem is referring to that term.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). So, in that case, each term from the first expansion with \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, so the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut when I did the term-by-term multiplication, I saw that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present when multiplied by \\(c^0\\), giving 120. So, which is it?\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. When you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all these coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in reality, when you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a term \\(x^k y^m\\) is the sum over all \\(n\\) of the coefficient of \\(x^k y^m z^n\\) in the product, which is the product of the coefficients from each polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum over all \\(c\\) terms of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second polynomial. Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in the earlier example, when I considered \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 2, which is 1 times (1 + 1) = 2. So, that aligns with this approach. So, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64 = 384.\n\nBut then, when I considered \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), I got 120, which would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so perhaps it's 384.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of it another way. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, in the product, each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6, \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 36, etc., all the way down to \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\) with coefficient 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed the sum of all these, which is 6 times 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the sum of the coefficients is 64, which is when \\(c = 1\\). So, when I set \\(c = 1\\), I get the sum of coefficients. Therefore, when I multiply by \\(6a^2b^2\\), the coefficient becomes 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) had a coefficient of 120, which is different. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier approach. Let me clarify: when I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I'm considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), so it's the sum of coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for all \\(k\\). So, that sum is 6 times the sum of coefficients of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120, that's a different question. Since the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so 384.\n\nWait, but let me check this with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion is \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 2, so 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would be 1 times 2 = 2. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, which includes \\(ac\\) and \\(a/c\\). So, that aligns with the idea that the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, which is 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nSimilarly, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm getting conflicting results because earlier I thought that \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) has a coefficient of 120, which is different. So, perhaps the problem is ambiguous, but given the way it's phrased, I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then it's the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because otherwise, the term would have some power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient where \\(c\\) cancels out, which would be 120.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero. So, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent is zero is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the term is \\(20c^0\\). Then, when I multiply by \\(6a^2b^2\\), I get \\(120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but then why did I think it was 384 earlier? Because I considered the sum of all coefficients, but that would be if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), which is not the case. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think refers to \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), so 120.\n\nI think I need to clarify this. When the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it's referring to the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the term would have a power of \\(c\\). So, the correct answer is 120.\n\nWait, but in the earlier example, when I had \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 2, which includes both \\(a^2c\\) and \\(a^2c^{-1}\\). So, in that case, the problem would be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which is 2. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nWait, but in that example, if I had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2c^0\\), it would be 1 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 1 * 2 = 2, but that's not the case. Wait, no, in the example, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\) has coefficients 1 and 1, so the sum is 2, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 0 because it's an odd power. Wait, no, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\), the expansion is \\(c + 1/c\\), so there is no \\(c^0\\) term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2c^0\\) would be 0, but the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 2, which includes both \\(a^2c\\) and \\(a^2c^{-1}\\).\n\nSo, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384, while the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120.\n\nTherefore, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still confused because when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I get terms with different powers of \\(c\\), each with their own coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all these coefficients, which is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) had a coefficient of 120, which is different. So, perhaps the problem is asking for that specific term, but the way it's phrased, it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all powers of \\(c\\). So, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nBut I'm still not entirely confident. Let me try to compute it step by step.\n\nFirst, compute the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\):\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nNow, compute the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficients are:\n\n- \\(c^6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0} = 1\\)\n- \\(c^4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1} = 6\\"

    "text": " Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. \n\nFirst off, I remember that when dealing with expressions like \\((x + y)^n\\), we can use the binomial theorem to expand them. The binomial theorem says that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^{k}\\). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nBut wait, the expression has two parts multiplied together: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since these are multiplied, I think the terms from each expansion will multiply each other. But the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nHold on, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). The other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so it might contribute terms with \\(c\\) raised to some power. But since the problem is only asking about \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms? Or do I?\n\nWait, no, because when you multiply the two expansions together, every term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will multiply every term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you'd get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but since the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think again. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would require me to find all terms in the product where the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is one specific term, and in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), any term would be multiplied by this. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion will contribute to the coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try another approach. Let's first find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\). So, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs is when \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6.\n\nNow, I need to consider the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand this using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nBut how does this affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Since the two expansions are multiplied together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider all possible terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, so the coefficient in the product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, I need to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nTo find the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial, I can substitute \\(c = 1\\) because that will make each term equal to its coefficient. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Let me go through it again.\n\nFirst, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNext, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, when we multiply the two expansions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, which means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 is indeed 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider whether the exponents of \\(c\\) affect the term \\(a^2b^2\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think that approach is correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's another way to approach this. Maybe by expanding both parts separately and then looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nExpanding \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nExpanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{0} = 1\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{1} = 6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{2} = 15\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), and then it starts decreasing: \\(\\dbinom{6}{4} = 15\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{5} = 6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{6} = 1\\).\n\nSo, the sum of these coefficients is \\(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64\\), which matches what I found earlier by substituting \\(c = 1\\).\n\nTherefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, effectively adding 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion. So, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused now. Let me think again. If I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6 \\), and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then yes, it's 6 times 64. But if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then it would be different. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nSo, I think 384 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me check with another approach. Let me consider the entire expansion. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\). If I expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^{k} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that requires \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I need to sum over all possible \\(m\\) from 0 to 6. So, the total coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\).\n\nSince \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\), then the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, that confirms it again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and since the second part's expansion has 64 as the sum of coefficients, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\) again. It's 1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem and consider the contributions from each part of the product.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I can break this down into two parts because the expression is a product of two binomials raised to powers. So, I can handle each part separately and then combine them.\n\nStarting with the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). I remember that when expanding a binomial like \\((a + b)^n\\), the coefficients can be found using the binomial theorem, which involves combinations. The binomial theorem states that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^{k}\\). So, in this case, \\(n = 4\\), and I'm looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to find the coefficient when \\(k = 2\\) because \\(a^{4 - 2}b^{2} = a^2b^2\\).\n\nCalculating the binomial coefficient for \\(k = 2\\), it's \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). I think \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!}\\). Let me compute that: \\(4! = 24\\), and \\(2! = 2\\), so \\(24 / (2 * 2) = 24 / 4 = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nAlright, that's the first part done. Now, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, I need to figure out what this expands to, but actually, since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to expand the entire thing. Wait, no, actually, I think I might need to consider both parts together because the problem is the product of these two expressions. So, maybe I should find the expansion of each and then look for the term that, when multiplied together, gives me \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, actually, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), so perhaps the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Let me think.\n\nWait, no, because the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply them, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think that term must come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second part. Because if I take any other term from the second expansion, it would introduce a \\(c\\) term, which would make the overall term involve \\(c\\), but since the problem is only asking about \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that's the only term that contributes.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. So, if I take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the resulting term will be \\(6 \\times \\text{constant term}\\) times \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's think about that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nI need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, setting \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), we solve for \\(k\\): \\(6 = 2k\\) \u21d2 \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 * 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, is that right? Wait, 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720 / (6 * 6) = 720 / 36 = 20. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nSo, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and the constant term comes only from the second part, so when multiplied together, their coefficients multiply as well. So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, let me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe by considering the entire expansion, but I think that's more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the entire expression as a product and think about how the terms combine, but I think my initial approach is correct.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe I should check if there's any other term in the second expansion that could combine with the first to give \\(a^2b^2\\). But no, because any term from the second expansion would involve \\(c\\) raised to some power, so unless it's the constant term, it would introduce a \\(c\\) term, which isn't present in \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, only the constant term from the second expansion would contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me verify the calculations again.\n\nFirst part: \\((a + b)^4\\), coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Correct.\n\nSecond part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), looking for the constant term. The term is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Correct.\n\nSo, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's the answer. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by multiplying the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. From \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. From \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiplying these together: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, when I multiply them out, each term from the first expansion will multiply each term from the second expansion.

But wait, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not multiplied by anything else. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the terms where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\), those terms won't have any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) in them.

Let me use the binomial theorem again for this part.\n\nThe expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).

Each term will be \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nWait, but in the original problem, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). However, in the second part, the variables are \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, does this mean that the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)?\n\nLet me think. The entire expression is a product of two separate binomial expansions: one involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since these variables are different, the terms in the first expansion don't interact with the terms in the second expansion in a way that would change the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nIn other words, when multiplying out the entire expression, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear is if we take the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by any term from the second part. However, since the second part doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the entire term from the second part will just be some constant coefficient multiplied by \\(c\\) raised to some power.\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means we need to consider the entire coefficient when \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient from the second part will just multiply the coefficient from the first part.\n\nBut hold on, that doesn't seem right. Let me clarify. If we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes a coefficient that gets multiplied by 6 (from the first part), and since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we have to consider all possible contributions.\n\nWait, no, that might not be correct either. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it just adds a coefficient in front of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all those terms. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nBut wait, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, let's calculate that. If \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but hold on. Is that correct? Because when we multiply out the two expansions, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which are \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times each \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we have to sum over all \\(m\\), which gives us 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m\\) from 0 to 6, which is indeed 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nBut let me verify that. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is simply the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient that will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, another way to think about it is that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply them, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first expansion, and it's multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me think about a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{2}{2} = 1\\), and the sum of coefficients in the second part is \\(2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Let's check by expanding: \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c) = c + 1/c\\). Multiplying them together: \\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is indeed 1 * (1 + 1) = 2, which is correct. So, applying the same logic, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, I think the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient from the \\((a + b)^4\\) expansion, which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, we consider the entire second expansion \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of its coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), yielding \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these results gives the final coefficient: \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. \n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression raised to a power like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^{k}\\). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLooking at the expression, there are two parts: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I notice that the first part only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, their coefficients won't interfere with each other when multiplying the two parts together. So, I can probably handle each part separately and then combine the results.\n\nStarting with the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, I can write this as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\). I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, this can be expanded as \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{m}\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWait, but in the original problem, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). The second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so unless \\(c\\) terms affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), which they don't, because they're different variables. So, when we multiply the two expressions together, each term from the first expansion will multiply each term from the second expansion. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider how that term interacts with the second part.\n\nWait, actually, I think I might have gotten confused here. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two, the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that means the coefficient is the same as the coefficient in the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. Actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be the coefficient from the first part (\\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by the entire second part, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so it's just multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, when multiplied together, the variables are separate. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the first polynomial, and it would be multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that seems like it would result in a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single coefficient. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, we're considering all terms where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part (\\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by the entire second part's expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. So, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term in the second part. That makes more sense because then the coefficient would be a number.\n\nSo, to clarify, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering only the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero. That is, we're looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nOkay, that makes sense now. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already found to be 6. Then, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. \n\nSo, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). \n\nTherefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that's not right. Let me check that calculation again.\n\nWait, 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 6!/(3!3!) = 720/(6*6) = 720/36 = 20. Yes, that's correct. So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. When we multiply these two expressions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we need to consider how many times \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term. \n\nWait, actually, no. When we multiply the two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused again. Let me try to clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) must come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part by the constant term from the second part, which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense now. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term will be of the form \\(a^{4 - k}b^{k} \\times c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as before, which gives us the coefficient 6. Then, for the \\(c\\) part, we need the exponent to be zero, which gives \\(m = 3\\), as we found, giving a coefficient of 20. So, when we multiply these two, we get 6 * 20 = 120, and the term is \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying them together gives 120, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Yeah, that seems right.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

Let me write that out.\n\nFor \\((a + b)^4\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2} b^{2}\\).\n\nCalculating the binomial coefficient: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm wondering if this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), I think the coefficients in the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) part are independent of the coefficients in the \\(c\\) part. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is in the other part for the term that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product of two parts.\n\nWait, actually, maybe I need to think differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), maybe the coefficient remains 6 regardless of the second part. But that seems too straightforward. Let me check.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second.

But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), that is, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) combined with any power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit off because the problem might be expecting a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I just need to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But that doesn't seem right because the problem probably expects the coefficient to be 6 regardless of the \\(c\\) part, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another approach: maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's written as \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, no, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so perhaps it's considering all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would be 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6*64=384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's correct.\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so in the product of the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present in the first part, and when multiplied by each term in the second part, it will create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from -6 to 6.

So, \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure if that's correct because I'm not sure if the problem expects the coefficient to be combined with the \\(c\\) terms or not.\n\nWait, let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, each multiplied by 6. Therefore, yes, it would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, let me check that again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes a term with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would be the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion multiplied by 6.\n\nBut actually, no, that's not correct. Because in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times the entire second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all terms would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it's \\(6 \\times\\) (coefficient) \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, if we're considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nBut wait, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, but it's not specified. The problem just says \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think it's considering all terms where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me check this another way. Let's consider the entire expansion:\n\n\\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nAnd \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, when we multiply these two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient to the product with \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSince the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit confused because sometimes when you have products like this, the coefficients can interfere, but in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), their coefficients don't interfere. So, I think 384 is the correct answer.\n\nBut let me check with another approach. Let's compute the entire product and see.\n\nWait, that might take too long, but perhaps I can compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product by considering that it's the product of the coefficients from each part. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the sum of all its coefficients, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the product, each term is a combination of \\(a^kb^l\\) and \\(c^m\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any \\(c^m\\). So, that is indeed 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " Hmm, let me think about how to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with expressions raised to a power, the binomial theorem is super useful. The binomial theorem says that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^k\\). So, maybe I can apply this theorem to both parts of the given expression separately and then combine the results.\n\nLet me break it down. The expression has two parts: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since I'm only asked about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think I can focus on expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) first because that's where the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes from. The other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), might just contribute a constant factor, but I'm not sure yet. Let me check.\n\nStarting with \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion will be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n\\]\n\nI need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which means \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I should find the value of \\(k\\) such that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). That makes sense because \\(4 - 2 = 2\\). So, the term is:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2} b^{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient here is 6. That's the coefficient from the first part.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, this expands to:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nHmm, so each term in this expansion will have a power of \\(c\\) that depends on \\(m\\). But wait, the original problem is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all. That means I need to consider how these two expansions interact when multiplied together.\n\nWait, actually, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but only for the terms where the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out, because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not any specific power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, I think I might be overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, let me clarify: the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the product will be of the form \\(a^{k}b^{4 - k}c^{6 - 2m}\\) where \\(k\\) is from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) is from 0 to 6. But since the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is when \\(k = 2\\), so \\(4 - k = 2\\), then the coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) times \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is actually a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. But the problem just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering the entire coefficient, which would include terms from the second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which usually refers to the coefficient regardless of other variables. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the coefficient when all variables are considered, but I might be misinterpreting.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). That is, it's considering \\(a^2b^2\\) times some combination of \\(c\\) terms, but the coefficient would then be a sum of coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the binomial coefficient from the first.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would then be a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), which isn't a constant. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting us to treat \\(c\\) as an independent variable, but then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would include terms with \\(c\\), but that seems odd. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems more complicated than necessary.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's just the product of the coefficients from each part, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is a separate expansion. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would involve summing over all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. But that would make the coefficient a sum of coefficients from the second expansion, each multiplied by 6, which is the coefficient from the first part.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as the product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I expand the product, each term is a product of a term from each polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion would be the sum of the products of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and each term from the second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is a sum over all terms in the second expansion, each multiplied by 6. But that would result in a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), which seems odd because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a constant.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), meaning that we can treat \\(c\\) as a separate variable and just multiply the coefficients. But that doesn't make sense because then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so perhaps it's intended to consider the coefficient in the entire expansion, which would include all powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a sum of terms, each multiplied by 6. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems complicated, and I think I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's considering the entire expression as a product, and the coefficient is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Then, from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient is the entire expansion, which is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which seems odd because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", implying a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial in \\(c\\). Therefore, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient would be the sum of all possible products of the coefficients from each part that result in \\(a^2b^2\\). But that's essentially what I was thinking earlier, which would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, which should be a number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually only considering the part \\((a + b)^4\\) and ignoring the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part, but that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but considering only the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). That makes more sense because then the coefficient would be a constant.\n\nSo, let me try that approach. If I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then I need to find the term in the expansion where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That means I need to find the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6, and then multiply it by the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) for \\(c^0\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.\n\nSo, let's find the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Using the binomial expansion:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nWe need the term where the exponent is zero, so set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\):\n\n\\[\n6 - 2m = 0 \\implies 2m = 6 \\implies m = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient from the second part is 20. Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me confirm this. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20. So, when we multiply these two terms together, we get \\(6 \\times 20 \\times a^2b^2c^0\\), which is \\(120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is phrased as asking for a specific coefficient, which is typically a constant. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that we need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nLet me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n1. Expanded \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem and found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. That seems correct because \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. Expanded \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and found the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero by solving \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). That also seems correct.\n\n3. Multiplied the two coefficients together: 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense because when you multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term from the second part, resulting in \\(120a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, I think I did this correctly. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then multiplying them together.\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term (where \\(c^0\\)) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. Multiply the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Hmm, let's see. I remember that when dealing with expansions, the binomial theorem is usually helpful. \n\nFirst, let me break down the problem. The expression is a product of two binomial expressions: one involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I can handle each part separately and then combine them.\n\nStarting with the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). I know from the binomial theorem that the expansion of \\((a + b)^n\\) is the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(n\\) of \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^k\\). So in this case, \\(n = 4\\). I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would be when \\(a^{2}b^{2}\\), which means \\(k = 2\\), because \\(n - k = 2\\) implies \\(k = 2\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So that part is straightforward, the coefficient is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to figure out what the expansion looks like, but since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe I don't need to expand this part at all? Wait, no, because the entire expression is a product, so perhaps I need to consider how the terms from both expansions multiply together.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me think. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), right? Because the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply the two expansions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means I need to find the term in the second expansion that is a constant term (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains as \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms).\n\nSo, essentially, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because that will be the only term that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), doesn't introduce any \\(c\\) terms. Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the product of the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) and the constant term from the second part.\n\nAlright, so let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, the expansion is the sum from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero for the constant term, so set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\): \\(6 = 2m\\), so \\(m = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because 6! is 720, and 3! is 6, so 720 divided by (6 times 6) is 20. Hmm, but actually, 6 choose 3 is 20, yes. So the constant term is 20.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 (from the first expansion) multiplied by 20 (from the second expansion). So, 6 times 20 is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Let me go through the steps again.\n\nFirst, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). That's correct.\n\nNext, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Setting the exponent to zero gives \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20, which is correct.\n\nTherefore, when multiplying the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, in this case, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is from the first part, and it's being multiplied by the constant term from the second part. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will indeed be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nIs there any chance I missed something? Let me consider whether there are other terms in the second expansion that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by terms from the first expansion. But no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion by the constant term from the second expansion. Any other term from the second expansion would introduce a \\(c\\) term, which would make the product have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something like that, but not just \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, just to double-check, maybe I should compute the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) to confirm the constant term is indeed 20. Let's see:\n\nThe expansion is:\n\n\\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 + \\dbinom{6}{1}c^4 + \\dbinom{6}{2}c^2 + \\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 + \\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} + \\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} + \\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6}\\).\n\nCalculating the coefficients:\n\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{0} = 1\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{1} = 6\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{2} = 15\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{4} = 15\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{5} = 6\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{6} = 1\\)\n\nSo, the constant term is indeed 20. Therefore, my calculation is correct.\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's the answer. Let me just write it in the required format.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by multiplying the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nFor \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nFor \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nMultiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient we just found.\n\nWait, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I'm essentially multiplying it by each term in the expansion of that binomial. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), the coefficient will just be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't sound right.\n\nHold on, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me clarify: The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is the product of two binomials. So, actually, I'm looking for the term in the expansion that has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms at all because \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\). Is that possible?\n\nWait, no, that can't be right. Because the entire expression is a product, so every term in the expansion will be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like a lot.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But since the problem just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) part, then maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second binomial, leading to terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc.\n\nWait, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering all possible terms where the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts are squared, regardless of the \\(c\\) part. So, in other words, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the overall product.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit off because in the product, each term would have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second binomial, which would be 6 times \\(2^6\\) because the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 would be 384. But wait, that seems too large. Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have different coefficients depending on the power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. Hmm, but that's not specified in the problem.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try a different approach. Let's expand both expressions separately and then see how the terms combine.\n\nFirst, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), as I did earlier, gives terms up to \\(a^4\\) and \\(b^4\\). The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6.\n\nNext, expanding \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem: \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6 a^2b^2 \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\).\n\nBut if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, we need to find the term in the second expansion where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0.\n\nLooking at the second expansion: \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We set the exponent equal to 0: \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient for \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by 20 from the second expansion, giving a total coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, so which interpretation is correct? The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying the power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), meaning the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. But that seems unlikely because usually, when a term is asked for without specifying other variables, it's implied that those variables are set to the lowest or zero power.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify any power for \\(c\\), so maybe it's just considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second binomial. But that would mean the coefficient is a sum involving \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a constant, not a function of \\(c\\).\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients can be combined. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, each of which has some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by all the terms from the second polynomial, leading to \\(a^2b^2\\) times a polynomial in \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the entire second polynomial multiplied by 6, because each term in the second polynomial contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nBut that would mean the coefficient is not a single number, but a polynomial. But the problem asks for the coefficient, implying it's a numerical value. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\).\n\nIn that case, as I calculated earlier, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me verify that. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. The term \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is when the exponent is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would result in a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. Since the problem asks for the coefficient, which is a number, it must be referring to the coefficient when considering \\(c^0\\), so 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables are separate. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in the first polynomial, and it's multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which are in \\(c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the entire expansion of the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributing to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. But that seems contradictory because the coefficient should be a scalar, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: When you have two polynomials multiplied together, say \\(P(a, b) \\cdot Q(c)\\), then each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\). So, the coefficient of a specific term in \\(P(a, b)\\), say \\(a^2b^2\\), when multiplied by \\(Q(c)\\), will result in \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot Q(c)\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\(P(a, b) \\cdot Q(c)\\) is actually \\(Q(c)\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\). But since \\(Q(c)\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\cdot Q(c)\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, the problem asks for the coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(Q(c)\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem expects a numerical answer. Therefore, it's more likely that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Let's consider the entire product:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\left(\\sum_{i=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{i} a^{4 - i}b^i\\right) \\left(\\sum_{j=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{j} c^{6 - j} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^j\\right)\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the second sum:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{j=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{j} c^{6 - 2j}\n\\]\n\nSo, the product becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=0}^4 \\sum_{j=0}^6 \\dbinom{4}{i}\\dbinom{6}{j} a^{4 - i}b^i c^{6 - 2j}\n\\]\n\nNow, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which corresponds to \\(4 - i = 2\\) and \\(i = 2\\). So, \\(i = 2\\), and the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNow, for each \\(j\\), the term will have \\(c^{6 - 2j}\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2j}\\) is \\(6 \\cdot \\dbinom{6}{j}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible exponents of \\(c\\). However, coefficients are typically associated with specific terms, so perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would require \\(6 - 2j = 0\\), so \\(j = 3\\). Then, the coefficient is \\(6 \\cdot \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\cdot 20 = 120\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by 6. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. But that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384, which seems high, and it's a constant, not a polynomial. But in reality, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the entire second polynomial, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually the second polynomial itself multiplied by 6, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient isn't a single number unless we're considering a specific power of \\(c\\).\n\nGiven that the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's likely that it's referring to the coefficient when \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power, i.e., the constant term. Therefore, the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but to confirm, let's think about it differently. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Then, the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\cdot 64\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this case would be 6 * 64 = 384. But this is under the substitution \\(c = 1\\), which gives the sum of all coefficients. However, the problem didn't specify substituting \\(c = 1\\), so this approach might not be correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I don't substitute \\(c = 1\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem asks for a numerical coefficient, it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient when \\(c\\) is at a specific power, probably zero, making the answer 120.\n\nI think I've gone in circles, but I'm leaning towards the answer being 120 because it makes sense that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, I'll go with that.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Hmm, let me think about how to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nIn this case, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me expand that first. Using the binomial theorem, the expansion will have terms from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(k = 4\\). Each term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\).\n\nNow, I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. So, in the expansion, I need \\(4 - k = 2\\) for the exponent of \\(a\\), which implies \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6.\n\nBut wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire expression.\n\nHmm, so the entire expression is the product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since these are multiplied together, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut wait, I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think: when I multiply two expressions together, the variables from each expression multiply as well. However, in this case, the variables in the first expression are \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and in the second expression, they are \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, they won't interfere with each other in the multiplication. That means the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in the first part are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\) in the second part.\n\nSo, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term will come from taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion and multiplying it by any term in the second expansion. But wait, actually, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second, but the variables are separate. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will only be present in the first polynomial, and the second polynomial's terms involve \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) variables.\n\nWait, let me clarify that. When I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion will have some combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is specifically a term with only \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so when multiplied by terms from the second polynomial, it will result in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot c^{-k}\\), etc., depending on the term in the second polynomial.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, is that correct? Because in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\), so unless we're considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term (if any) from the second polynomial, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait a minute, let me think again. The second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that as well. Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\cdot (1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\), where \\(m\\) goes from 0 to 6.\n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6 a^2b^2 \\cdot \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So, unless there's a term in the second expansion that is a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), which would be when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\).\n\nSo, when \\(m = 3\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). So, that term is 20. So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by this term, I get \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2 = 120 a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, in the first expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I calculated earlier. In the second expansion, the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs at \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when I multiply these two terms together, I get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) because the constant term doesn't add any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so it just scales the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the entire product, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion can only contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the final product if it is multiplied by a term in the second expansion that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), i.e., the constant term. Otherwise, the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or similar, which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\) by itself.\n\nTherefore, the only contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by the constant term in the second expansion. So, that's 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), giving 120.\n\nLet me double-check this reasoning. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), when expanded, gives terms up to \\(a^4\\) and \\(b^4\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, gives terms with various powers of \\(c\\), including \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when I multiply these two expansions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, for example, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., except when it's multiplied by the constant term \\(c^0\\), which gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, just to make sure I haven't missed anything, let me consider whether there's another way \\(a^2b^2\\) could appear in the product. For example, could there be a term in the second expansion that, when multiplied by another term in the first expansion, results in \\(a^2b^2\\)? But since the second expansion only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), and the first expansion only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the variables are separate. Therefore, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear is if it's multiplied by a constant term from the second expansion. So, no other terms from the second expansion would affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, because they would introduce \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factors, which aren't present in \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, I think my reasoning is correct. The coefficient is 120.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the entire expression is the product of two independent expansions. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Since these are independent, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of these two coefficients, which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. \n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with expansions like \\((a + b)^n\\), we can use the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem states that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So maybe I can apply that here.\n\nSince I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can focus on the part of the expression involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), which is \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me expand that first.\n\nApplying the binomial theorem to \\((a + b)^4\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me calculate the binomial coefficient for that term.\n\n\\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is equal to \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider how this part affects the coefficient. Wait, but the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they are separate variables. So, maybe I can treat \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as a constant factor when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nBut actually, that might not be the case. Let me think again. The expression is a product of two parts: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these out, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nHowever, since we are only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can consider that term separately. The \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, that doesn't sound right. Actually, no, because the entire expression is a product. So, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), we can think of it as the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut I think that might not be correct because each term in the product will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. However, since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms can be anything, so effectively, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut wait, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nHmm, but let me double-check that. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest of the expression is multiplied by it, but since we're only looking for the coefficient, and not specific terms with \\(c\\), it's just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product, so maybe I need to consider that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the other part.\n\nWait, but no, that would be the case if we were looking for the constant term or something. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, regardless of the other terms, because the other part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. So, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand the entire product, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed when \\(c = 1\\), which is 64, as I thought earlier. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm that. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient being 6, and the entire expansion of the other part is just a multiplier, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times whatever the entire expansion is. But no, that's not correct because each term is multiplied by each term, so the coefficient would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the other expansion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the coefficient being 6, and the rest of the terms involving \\(c\\) would be separate, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the other part. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with a smaller exponent to see if this approach is correct. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding \\((a + b)^2\\) gives \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because \\((a + b)^2\\) only goes up to \\(b^2\\). Wait, no, in \\((a + b)^2\\), the highest degree is 2, so \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present. So, in that case, the coefficient would be zero.\n\nWait, but in our problem, \\((a + b)^4\\) does have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so maybe the approach is correct. Alternatively, perhaps I should think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the terms. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nBut the sum of all coefficients in the second part is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think of it as the coefficient being 6, and the entire expansion of the second part is multiplied by it, so the coefficient remains 6, but that doesn't make sense because each term in the second part is a separate term.\n\nWait, no, because in the product, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficient is just 6, and the rest of the terms involving \\(c\\) are separate, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6. But that doesn't seem right because the entire product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., each with coefficient 6. Therefore, if the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but maybe the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), irrespective of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, it's 6 times the entire expansion, which would make the coefficient 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, but that seems unlikely because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients would multiply.\n\nWait, perhaps I can approach it differently. Let me think about the entire expression as a product of two polynomials. The first polynomial is in variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the second polynomial. But that can't be, because the second polynomial is not a constant.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think of it as two separate polynomials. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part because each term in the second part is multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a b\\) would be zero because there's no \\(a b\\) term. Wait, but in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^1\\) is zero because the first polynomial only has \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms separately, not multiplied together.\n\nBut in our case, the first polynomial is \\((a + b)^4\\), which does have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so when multiplied by the second polynomial, each term in the second polynomial is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nTherefore, I think my initial approach is correct. The coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by expanding each part separately. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**  \n   Using the binomial theorem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Consider \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**  \n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n\n3. **Combine the results:**  \n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I remember that when dealing with expressions raised to a power, the binomial theorem is super useful. The binomial theorem states that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^k\\). So, I can apply this theorem to both parts of the given expression: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), right? Because the other part of the expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't directly affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, maybe I can handle each part separately and then multiply the relevant coefficients together.\n\nLet me start with \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion will have terms like \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). I need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so let's find the value of \\(k\\) that gives \\(b^2\\). That would be when \\(k = 2\\), because \\(4 - k = 2\\) implies \\(k = 2\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). Okay, so the coefficient is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but since this part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), it doesn't directly affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Wait, but the entire expression is the product of the two expansions. So, maybe I need to consider the entire expansion and how the terms combine.\n\nWait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term comes from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part and any term in the second part. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient would just be the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of all terms from the second part. Hmm, but that doesn't seem right because the second part is being multiplied as a whole. Wait, no, actually, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first part, when we multiply by the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first part, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself (without any \\(c\\) terms) would require that the second part contributes a term with \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because if I'm looking for \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, then I need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient from the first part and the constant term from the second part.\n\nSo, first, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's do that using the binomial theorem again. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\).\n\nSo, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the constant term from the second part. So, that's 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Because the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When we expand both, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, we need to consider all possible ways to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by terms from the second expansion that result in \\(a^2b^2\\). But since the second expansion only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term from the second expansion, which is 20. So, the total coefficient is indeed 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. But when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. So, in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first polynomial, and the second polynomial is in \\(c\\), the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), which in this case is the constant term from the second polynomial. So, yes, the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire product being the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the product of the coefficients from each part. Since the second part contributes a constant term, which is 20, and the first part contributes 6, so 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm not missing something. Suppose I expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) separately, and then multiply them. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, and in the second expansion, the constant term is 20. So, when I multiply these two, I get 6 \u00d7 20 \u00d7 a\u00b2b\u00b2, which is 120a\u00b2b\u00b2. So, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't interact with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not correct because the sum of all coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\), but that's not what we need here. We need the constant term because we want the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero to multiply with \\(a^2b^2\\) to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms.\n\nWait, so maybe I was right the first time. The coefficient is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nBut let me try another approach to confirm. Let's consider that the entire expression is the product of two expansions. The first expansion gives terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second gives terms involving \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product can only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion by the constant term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but maybe I should also check the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) more carefully. Let me write out the expansion:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, the terms are:\n\n- For \\(k=0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1 \\times c^6\\)\n- \\(k=1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^4 = 6c^4\\)\n- \\(k=2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^2 = 15c^2\\)\n- \\(k=3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\\)\n- \\(k=4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(k=5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(k=6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the constant term is indeed 20 when \\(k=3\\). Therefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, we only consider the multiplication by the constant term, which is 20. So, the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there another way that \\(a^2b^2\\) could appear in the product? For example, could \\(a^2b^2\\) be multiplied by a term with \\(c^k\\) and then somehow \\(c^k\\) cancels out? But no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) is a separate variable. So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as the product of two polynomials, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part, since they don't interfere with each other. So, the coefficient from the first part is 6, and from the second part, since we're taking the constant term, it's 20. So, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem on each part separately.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the expansion where \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2} b^{2} = 6 a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   The coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   We need the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)).

So, the entire expression is:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4) \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\n\\]\n\nI need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, so in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will come from multiplying the corresponding terms in each expansion. That is, the \\(6a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, actually, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part is in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, so each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial.\n\nBut actually, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, right? Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each of those will give terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(6a^2b^2(1/c)^k\\), but none of these will affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the overall product. Wait, no, actually, I think I'm confusing myself.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify: when you multiply two polynomials together, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, which is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will actually be part of the expansion as \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is if the \\(c\\) terms cancel out.\n\nWait, that can't be right because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is actually zero because there's no way to eliminate the \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for it, so maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, in the entire expansion, how many times does \\(a^2b^2\\) appear, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But I think that's not the case because usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term in a product like this, you're looking for the term that matches exactly, considering all variables. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but that would result in a term that includes \\(c\\) terms, so perhaps the coefficient is actually zero because \\(a^2b^2\\) can't be combined with \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first expansion, specifically from the term \\(6a^2b^2\\), and it is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has terms like \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, 1, 1/c^2, 1/c^4, 1/c^6\\), each with their own coefficients.\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, to get a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, we need to multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because only then will the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, resulting in a term that is just \\(6a^2b^2\\) times 1, giving \\(6a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be \\(6\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's compute that.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\):\n\n\\(6 - 2k = 0\\)\n\n\\(2k = 6\\)\n\n\\(k = 3\\)\n\nSo, the term where \\(k = 3\\) is the constant term. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\):\n\n\\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in the second part, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. When we multiply these two terms together, we get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\), and the term is \\(120a^2b^2\\). So, yes, that makes sense.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) and identifying the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. Then, we find the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"
