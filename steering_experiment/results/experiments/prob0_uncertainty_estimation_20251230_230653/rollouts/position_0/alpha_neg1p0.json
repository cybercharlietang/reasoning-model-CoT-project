    "text": " \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the problem is asking. It's asking for the coefficient of a specific term, \\(a^2b^2\\), which appears in the expansion of the product of two binomials raised to certain powers. So, the expression is a product of two separate expansions: one involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). \n\nSince the problem is about finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can note that this term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) at all. That means, when expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will come from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) alone, and the other part of the product, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), will contribute a term that doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. \n\nWait, actually, no. Let me think again. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it will be multiplied by every term from the second part. But since the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what happens with \\(c\\), I think I can treat the two parts separately. \n\nIn other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not involving \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I need to clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by any term from the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the result will be terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot c^{-k}\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That suggests that we are only considering terms where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the term remains \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) involved. \n\nWait, no, that's not right. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, it's possible that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by any term from the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it would produce terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot c^{-k}\\). But since the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps I'm supposed to consider the entire expansion, but only collect the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and then sum their coefficients, regardless of the \\(c\\) exponents.\n\nWait, no, that can't be. Because in the product, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part, each of which is a different power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will actually appear multiple times in the product, each time multiplied by a different power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that we are looking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), because that's the only way the term remains \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nThat makes sense. So, the plan is: first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply those two coefficients together to get the final answer.\n\nStarting with the first part: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). I can use the binomial theorem for this. The binomial theorem states that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^n \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^k\\). \n\nIn this case, \\(x = a\\), \\(y = b\\), and \\(n = 4\\). We are looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), because \\(y^k = b^2\\) when \\(k = 2\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem for this. \n\nLet me write the general term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The binomial theorem tells me that each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, the term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). \n\nTherefore, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is when \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that can't be right because 6! is 720, but 3! is 6, so 6!/(3!3!) is 720/(6\u00d76) = 720/36 = 20. So, yes, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, I need to multiply the two coefficients I found: 6 and 20. So, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. \n\nFirst, for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), using the binomial coefficient: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). That's correct.\n\nNext, for the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Then, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). That's correct as well.\n\nMultiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. So, yes, that seems right.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is given by the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, each term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so we solve \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) to get \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is then \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\n   \\]\n\nMultiplying these two coefficients together gives the final answer:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the problem is asking. It's asking for the coefficient of a specific term, \\(a^2b^2\\), in the expanded form of the product of two binomial expressions. So, I think I can approach this by expanding each part separately and then multiplying them together, but maybe there's a smarter way without expanding everything.\n\nLet me recall that when you have expressions like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can use the binomial theorem to find the coefficients of specific terms. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\), where \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) is the binomial coefficient, which can be found using combinations.\n\nSo, in this problem, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part. Let me apply the binomial theorem here.\n\nFor \\((a + b)^4\\), the general term is \\(\\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so that's when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\), which is \\(\\frac{4!}{2!2!} = \\frac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm supposed to multiply this by the first part, so the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all, so maybe the coefficient in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part? But that doesn't make sense because the second part involves \\(c\\) terms, so maybe I need to consider how they interact.\n\nWait, no. Actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and in the product, it's multiplied by each term from the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that seems off because the second part is a separate expression.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in the expansion will be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will only come from the term in \\((a + b)^4\\) that is \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any term from the second expression. But wait, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that can't be right because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), so its coefficient would just be 6 times the entire sum of the second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product, but the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), so maybe the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but that's not correct because the product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2 \\times (1/c)^k\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term from the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut wait, that seems too broad. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the question is probably expecting a numerical coefficient, which suggests that maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is a product of two expressions. So, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part would be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributing to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible \\(c\\) terms.\n\nBut let me check that. The sum of the coefficients in the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\). So, when \\(c = 1\\), the expression becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me verify this approach. So, if I have two expressions, \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\), because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). That makes sense.\n\nSo, in this case, the coefficient from \\(P(a, b) = (a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of coefficients in \\(Q(c) = \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would include all the terms involving \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is not just 384, but it's more nuanced. Wait, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), meaning that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression in \\(c\\).\n\nWait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the entire expanded expression, collect all terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\), and find the sum of their coefficients. Since each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient times \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As I calculated before, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but only considering the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, meaning \\(c^0\\), so that the term is \\(a^2b^2\\) times 1. But that would be a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply those two coefficients together.\n\nSo, that would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me calculate that.\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. The general term is \\(\\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that makes more sense because the problem is likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would involve the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, I think this is the correct approach.\n\nLet me recap:\n\n1. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\): that's 6.\n2. Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\): that's 20.\n3. Multiply them together: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nSo, the coefficient is 120.\n\nI think this is the correct answer. Earlier, I thought it might be 384, but that would be if we were considering all terms, but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's more likely that it's referring to the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, making the term \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient is 120.\n\nLet me verify this with another approach. Alternatively, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I consider the product, each term in the expansion is of the form \\(\\binom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\binom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\binom{4}{k}\\binom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe are interested in the term where \\(a^{4 - k}b^k = a^2b^2\\), which implies \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNow, we also need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient from the second part is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the term is \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2c^0 = 120a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient is 120.\n\nYes, that confirms it. So, the correct answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the general term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which occurs when \\(k = 2\\).

Let me think about how to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that when dealing with expressions like \\((a + b)^n\\), the coefficients of the terms can be found using the binomial theorem. Similarly, for expressions like \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\), we can also apply the binomial theorem.

Hmm, so does that mean I need to consider both parts together? Let me think.\n\nI think that since the two parts are multiplied together, any term in the expansion will be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that term comes only from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, right? Because the other part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\).\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can treat the other part as a constant multiplier.

The coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\binom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that as well using the binomial theorem.\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{6 - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{m - (6 - m)} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{2m - 6}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term in this expansion is \\(\\binom{6}{m} c^{2m - 6}\\), where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6.\n\nNow, when we multiply the two expressions together, \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion.\n\nBut since we are only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, we can consider that the entire second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will contribute a factor that is multiplied by the coefficient 6 we found earlier.\n\nWait, but actually, no. Because when we multiply two polynomials, each term in the product is formed by multiplying a term from the first polynomial by a term from the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), so when we multiply it by each term in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by each term in the second part. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), those terms don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, because each term in the second part will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but that doesn't sound quite right. Let me think more carefully. Suppose I have two expressions, P = (a + b)^4 and Q = (c + 1/c)^6. Then, the product P * Q will have terms like (a^k b^{4 - k}) * (c^m / c^{6 - m}) = a^k b^{4 - k} c^{2m - 6}.\n\nBut the term a^2b^2 would come from k=2 in P, and any m in Q, because Q's terms don't involve a or b. So, the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the product P*Q would be the coefficient of a^2b^2 in P, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of Q, because each term in Q is multiplied by a^2b^2. So, the coefficient of a^2b^2 in P*Q would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in Q.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because Q is (c + 1/c)^6, which is a Laurent polynomial in c, and when we multiply by a^2b^2, the coefficients in Q are scalars, so the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in Q. But the sum of all coefficients in Q is found by setting c=1, which gives (1 + 1)^6 = 64.\n\nWait, that seems plausible. Let me check that. The sum of the coefficients in Q is indeed Q evaluated at c=1, which is (1 + 1)^6 = 64. So, the coefficient of a^2b^2 in P*Q would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because each term in Q is a term involving c and 1/c, so when I multiply a^2b^2 by each term in Q, I get a^2b^2 times c^m times 1/c^{6 - m} = a^2b^2 c^{2m - 6}.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of a^2b^2, regardless of the power of c. So, in the entire product, every term that is a^2b^2 multiplied by any power of c would contribute to the coefficient of a^2b^2. So, the coefficient of a^2b^2 would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in Q, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the coefficient of a^2b^2 is 6, and since Q is multiplied by this term, the entire coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in Q, which is 6*64=384. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of a^2b^2 in P is 6, and since in the product P*Q, each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q, the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in Q. Because each term in Q is a scalar multiple, so when you multiply by 6, you get 6 times each term in Q, which when summed gives 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but let me check this with a smaller example to make sure I'm not making a mistake. Suppose I have (a + b)^1 * (c + 1/c)^1. The coefficient of a^2b^2 would be zero because in (a + b)^1, the highest power is a^1b^0 and a^0b^1, so there's no a^2b^2 term. Wait, but that's a bad example because (a + b)^1 doesn't have a^2b^2.\n\nLet me take (a + b)^2 * (c + 1/c)^1. The coefficient of a^2b^2 in (a + b)^2 is 1 (from the term a^2b^0 and a^0b^2, but actually, the term a^2b^0 is when k=2, so the coefficient is 1 for a^2, and similarly 1 for b^2. Wait, but a^2b^2 would require both a^2 and b^2, which would come from (a + b)^4, but in (a + b)^2, the maximum degree is 2, so you can't have a^2b^2 in (a + b)^2. So, maybe my initial approach is correct, but perhaps the problem is that in (a + b)^4, the term a^2b^2 is present, and when multiplied by each term in (c + 1/c)^6, each of those terms will contribute a scalar multiple to the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the product.\n\nWait, but perhaps another way to think about it is that the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the product is equal to the coefficient of a^2b^2 in (a + b)^4 multiplied by the entire expansion of (c + 1/c)^6, but since a and b are separate variables from c, the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the product is just the product of the coefficients from each part. But that doesn't seem right because the two parts are multiplied together, so each term in the product is a combination of a term from each part.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to think of it as follows: when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. So, in this case, the term a^2b^2 can only come from a term in (a + b)^4 that is a^2b^2 and a term in (c + 1/c)^6 that is a constant term, because otherwise, the a^2b^2 term would be multiplied by some power of c, which would make it a^2b^2c^k, not just a^2b^2.\n\nWait, that's a different approach. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of a^2b^2 in (a + b)^4, which is 6, and then multiply it by the coefficient of c^0 in (c + 1/c)^6, because only the term where c^0 would result in a constant term, so when multiplied by a^2b^2, it would give a term a^2b^2. So, the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the product would be 6 times the coefficient of c^0 in (c + 1/c)^6.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because if I take a^2b^2 from the first part and multiply it by c^0 from the second part, I get a^2b^2. If I multiply it by c^1 or c^{-1}, I get a^2b^2c or a^2b^2/c, which are different terms. So, the only term that contributes to a^2b^2 in the product is when I take a^2b^2 from the first part and c^0 from the second part.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the product is 6 times the coefficient of c^0 in (c + 1/c)^6.\n\nNow, let's compute the coefficient of c^0 in (c + 1/c)^6.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem, as I did earlier, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\n(c + 1/c)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{m} \\cdot c^{- (6 - m)} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{2m - 6}\n\\]\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of c is 0, so 2m - 6 = 0 \u21d2 2m = 6 \u21d2 m = 3.\n\nSo, the coefficient of c^0 is \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\binom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of c^0 in (c + 1/c)^6 is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that seems different from my earlier conclusion where I thought it was 384. So, which one is correct?\n\nI think I made a mistake earlier when I considered the sum of all coefficients in Q. The correct approach is that to get a^2b^2 in the product, we need to multiply a^2b^2 (from the first part) by the constant term (c^0) from the second part. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nLet me verify this again. The term a^2b^2 comes from (a + b)^4, which has coefficient 6. The term c^0 in (c + 1/c)^6 has coefficient 20. So, when we multiply these two terms together, we get 6 * 20 = 120 as the coefficient for a^2b^2 in the entire product.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, my initial thought that it was 384 was incorrect because I was considering the sum of all coefficients in Q, which would give the total sum when c=1, but that's not the same as the coefficient of c^0. Instead, I needed to find the specific coefficient where the exponent of c is zero, which is 20.\n\nTherefore, the correct coefficient of a^2b^2 in the product is 120.\n\nWait, let me just double-check by expanding both parts a bit more.\n\nFirst, (a + b)^4: the expansion is a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4. So, the coefficient of a^2b^2 is indeed 6.\n\nNow, (c + 1/c)^6: as we saw, the expansion includes terms like c^6, 6c^4, 15c^2, 20c^0, 15c^{-2}, 6c^{-4}, c^{-6}. So, the coefficient of c^0 is 20.\n\nMultiplying these together, the term a^2b^2 from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, but only the term with c^0 will contribute to a^2b^2 in the product. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"

    "text": " \n\nHmm, okay. So I remember that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), the coefficient of a specific term can be found using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^{k}\\). So in this case, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would correspond to the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2.\n\nWait, but in this problem, the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So actually, this is a product of two binomials raised to different powers. So I think I need to consider both expansions separately and then multiply them together. But the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms when looking for that specific term.\n\nLet me think. So, first, let's handle \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion will have terms like \\(\\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\). So the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So that term is \\(\\binom{4}{2} a^2b^2\\). Calculating the binomial coefficient, \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\). So the coefficient here is 6.\n\nNow, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Similarly, I can expand this using the binomial theorem. The expansion will have terms like \\(\\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nBut wait, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other part involves \\(c\\), how do these interact? Oh, right, because the entire expression is the product of the two expansions, so each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion.\n\nBut since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that means we need to find all the terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponents of \\(c\\) can be anything because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, but actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then each term in the expansion will be of the form \\((a^kb^{4 - k}) \\times (c^m (1/c)^{6 - m})\\), right? So the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part when \\(k = 2\\), which gives us \\(a^2b^2\\), and then it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that means we can take the coefficient from the first part and multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, because each term in the second part will just add another factor that doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, each of which has a different power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would mean that we need to sum all the coefficients from the second part because each of those will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by the corresponding term from the first part.\n\nWait, but that seems confusing. Let me try to clarify. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So when you expand this, each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that means I'm looking for all terms where the part from \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^2b^2\\), and then multiplied by any term from the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would mean that the coefficient is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, that might not be right either. Because actually, when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of the terms that multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which only comes from the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, each term in the second part will contribute a factor that doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), and their coefficients add up.\n\nWait, let me think of it this way: The entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, if I denote the first part as \\(P = (a + b)^4\\) and the second part as \\(Q = \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then the product is \\(P \\times Q\\). Now, when you expand \\(P\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, as we found earlier. Then, when you expand \\(Q\\), each term is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\). So when you multiply \\(P\\) by \\(Q\\), each term in \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^m\\), where \\(m\\) varies depending on the term in \\(Q\\).\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. That means we're looking for all the terms where the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts are \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) parts. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\), because each term in \\(Q\\) contributes a coefficient that gets multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.\n\nWait, but is that correct? Because actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\), because each term in \\(Q\\) adds a multiple of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(Q\\).\n\nBut let me check that. The sum of the coefficients in \\(Q\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), because then each term becomes just its coefficient. So, \\(Q\\) evaluated at \\(c = 1\\) is \\((1 + 1/1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\) is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from \\(P\\)) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients in \\(Q\\)), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps I should treat the two parts separately and realize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest of the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, is the answer just 6?\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients would multiply. So, perhaps I need to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and it's multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64, as I calculated earlier by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384.\n\nWait, but that seems like a lot. Let me try another approach. Let's think about the entire expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the term is \\(\\binom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). Now, when we multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will be multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each coefficient in the second expansion gets multiplied by 6, and then they all add up when you consider all possible terms.\n\nSo, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), as I thought earlier. So, 6 times 64 is 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this by expanding \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\cdot \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficients are \\(\\binom{6}{m}\\) for each term. The sum of these coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), which matches.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when you have multiple variables, you have to consider cross terms, but in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the second part is multiplied entirely, so all the coefficients from the second part contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think 384 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of the two expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion, which has a sum of coefficients 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nYes, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, since the entire expression is the product of this binomial expansion and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we multiply the coefficient by the sum of the coefficients in the second binomial, which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n$\\boxed{384}$"

So, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\) and the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nI remember that when you have an expression like \\((x + y)^n\\), you can use the binomial theorem to expand it. The binomial theorem says that each term in the expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^k\\), where \\(\\dbinom{n}{k}\\) is the binomial coefficient, which can be found using combinations.\n\nSo, let me start with the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion. Using the binomial theorem, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) would be when \\(k = 2\\) because \\(a\\) is the first term and \\(b\\) is the second term. \n\nCalculating the binomial coefficient: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). I think this is 6 because 4 choose 2 is 6. So, the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). That means the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, this is a bit trickier because it's not just a simple binomial with two variables; it's a binomial with a reciprocal term. But I think I can still apply the binomial theorem here.\n\nThe expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will have terms of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\).

So, when I multiply them together, each term in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that term is independent of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second. So, if I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\), then each term in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), I think that the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by the term in the second part that is a constant (i.e., doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\)).\n\nSo, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That is, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because \\(c^0 = 1\\), which is a constant.\n\nLet me find that. As I mentioned earlier, each term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, I need to find the value of \\(k\\) such that \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), I get \\(6 = 2k\\) so \\(k = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} \\times 1\\). Calculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), that's 20. So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the constant term in the second part is 20. So, when I multiply these two together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when I multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by 20, giving \\(20a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 20 times 6, which is 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire product being equal to the product of each expansion, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 times 20, so 120. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nI don't think I've missed anything here. I considered each part separately, found the necessary coefficients, and then multiplied them together. So, I'm confident that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering each part separately. Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives the final coefficient.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Hmm, okay, let me break this down step by step. I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of binomial expansions, but I think I can figure this out.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), the coefficient of a specific term can be found using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^{k}\\). So, in this case, I have \\((a + b)^4\\), so I can expand that using the binomial theorem.\n\nI need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from when \\(k = 2\\), because then \\(a^{4 - 2}b^{2} = a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient here would be \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\binom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that mean I need to consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as well? Hmm, maybe not directly, because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\). Let me think about that.\n\nWhen I multiply two expressions together, the terms combine by multiplying each term from the first expression with each term from the second expression. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then when I multiply them, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every term from the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply by each term in the second expansion, you'd get different terms involving \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, maybe the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the terms involving \\(c\\). So, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some combination of terms from the second part, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe it's just the coefficient from the first part times the entire second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part isn't a constant; it's a variable expression. So, perhaps the problem is just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you're introducing terms with \\(c\\), but \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would remain 6. Hmm, but that seems too straightforward. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms. But that would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the product, and when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you're just adding more variables, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself doesn't change because it's multiplied by the entire expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would still be 6, as it's only from the first part.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second part, which would give terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^5\\), etc. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself wouldn't be present in the product unless the second part has a term with \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, perhaps I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that results in \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term, because that's the only term that would multiply with \\(a^2b^2\\) to give a term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms.\n\nSo, maybe I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6 to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Let me check that.\n\nSo, to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent on \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). I need this exponent to be 0 for the constant term, so:\n\n\\(6 - 2k = 0\\)\n\nSolving for \\(k\\):\n\n\\(2k = 6\\)\n\n\\(k = 3\\)\n\nSo, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\binom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by 20 from the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 120. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the constant term, which is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs at \\(k = 3\\), giving a coefficient of 20.\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term from the second part, resulting in 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that seems correct. I don't think I made any calculation errors. Let me just double-check the binomial coefficients:\n\n- \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\), correct.\n- \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\), correct.\n\nMultiplying them gives 120, so I think that's the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the final coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down step by step. I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of binomial expansions, but I'll give it a shot.\n\nFirst off, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that each term in the expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{n}{k}a^{n - k}b^k\\), where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to \\(n\\). So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), I can write it out as the sum of terms from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(k = 4\\).\n\nSimilarly, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I think this can also be expanded using the binomial theorem. Each term here will be \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\), right? Let me check that. Yeah, because each term is the product of the coefficients and the variables raised to the appropriate powers.\n\nSo, the overall expression is the product of two expanded binomials. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but in the entire expression, there are terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) as well. However, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so maybe I just need to consider the part of the product where the \\(c\\) terms cancel out?\n\nWait, no, actually, the \\(c\\) terms are separate. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(1\\) (i.e., the term where \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) multiply to 1) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply these two parts together, you get \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm thinking about this correctly. So, the overall expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, to get the term \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a term that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is already in the first part, so the second part needs to contribute a term that is just a constant (or in this case, a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) to the power that would make it a different variable term).\n\nWait, no, actually, the second part is only in terms of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient from the second expansion. But wait, no, because the second expansion is separate. So, actually, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which means that each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiplying it by the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is \\(c^0\\), because that would just be a constant, so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you'd get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant.\n\nWait, but actually, no, because the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which, when expanded, has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20c^0\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the term \\(c^0\\) is 20, right? Because when \\(m = 3\\), since \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would have terms from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(m = 6\\). So, when \\(m = 3\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{6 - 3}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^3 = \\dbinom{6}{3}c^3 \\times c^{-3} = \\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\\).\n\nSo, the term \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by 20 from the second part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 20 times the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\).\n\nWait, but hold on, I think I might be making a mistake here. Because actually, the entire expression is the product of two separate expansions, so each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is just one term, and when multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, it becomes \\(a^2b^2 \\times 20\\). So, the coefficient would be 20 times the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\).\n\nBut wait, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. So, 6 times 20 would be 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any miscalculations. Let me go through it again.\n\nFirst, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\). So, for \\(a^2b^2\\), we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNext, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nNow, since the two parts are multiplied together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and the term \\(c^0\\) from the second part combine to give \\(a^2b^2 \\times 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me check if there are any other terms that might contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by other terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). For example, could there be a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) that, when combined with another term, results in \\(a^2b^2\\)? But no, because \\(c^k\\) would have to be multiplied by \\(c^{-k}\\) to get \\(c^0\\), but that would require another term from the second expansion. However, in the product, each term is a product of one term from each expansion, so to get \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and the \\(c^0\\) term from the second expansion. Any other combination would involve \\(c\\) terms, which would make the term have \\(c\\) powers, not just \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nTherefore, the only contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term and the \\(c^0\\) term, which is 6 times 20, so 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of two binomial expansions. I correctly identified that I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, then multiplied them together. All the steps check out, so I feel confident that the answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the general term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   For the term \\(a^2b^2\\), we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\).

So, I need to figure out how to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), the coefficient of a specific term can be found using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^{k}\\). So, in this case, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be when \\(k = 2\\), right? Because \\(a^{4 - 2}b^{2} = a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, let me calculate that. The binomial coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\). I think that's 6 because \\(\\binom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. That part seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is the product of these two binomial expansions. Wait, but actually, the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so maybe the coefficients from the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, perhaps I just need to consider each part separately and then multiply their coefficients.\n\nWait, no, that might not be correct. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression multiplies each term in the second expression. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are different variables, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) come only from the first part, and the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) come only from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part, right? Because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so it doesn't affect their coefficients.\n\nWait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, for example, a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that means we're looking for the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that contributes a constant term, i.e., where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Because if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, that term is actually \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by whatever term comes from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then perhaps we need to consider that each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try another approach. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) by the constant term (the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), which is not the term we want. So, only the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), give a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, first, let's compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). As I thought earlier, that's \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNext, we need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To do that, we can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\binom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\binom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) and 20 (from the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\). Correct.\n\nIn \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term occurs when the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. The general term is \\(\\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Setting \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The term is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\). Correct.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me consider if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe by expanding both expressions and looking for the term. But that would be more time-consuming and prone to errors, especially since the expressions are of the 4th and 6th powers. So, using the binomial theorem as I did seems more efficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all different variables, their exponents don't interfere with each other. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the product of the coefficients from each expansion for the respective terms. But in this case, since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), and not any terms involving \\(c\\), we only need the constant term from the second expansion, as I thought earlier.\n\nSo, yes, I think my approach is correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for each part separately.\n\n1. **Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is given by the binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\):\n   \\[\n   \\binom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, the general term in the expansion is \\(\\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The constant term is \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\):\n   \\[\n   \\binom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the coefficients**:\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), the coefficients of the terms can be found using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^k\\), where \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) is the binomial coefficient, which can be found using combinations.\n\nIn this problem, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\). So, I can apply the binomial theorem here. Let me write that out:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\n\nI'm looking for the term where the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each. That means \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), which implies \\(k = 2\\). So, the term is:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\n\\]\n\nI can compute the binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\). The formula for combinations is \\(\\binom{n}{k} = \\dfrac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\\). Plugging in the numbers:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. That part seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and figure out how it interacts with the first part.\n\nWait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term comes from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) at all. It only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, does that mean that when I multiply these two expressions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the same as in the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms?\n\nLet me think about that. When I multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term comes only from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient in the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part, right?\n\nWait, no. Because each term in the second part is a separate term, but when I multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which are in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term involving only \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and not \\(c\\), that would mean that in the entire product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will have coefficients multiplied by each term in the second expression.\n\nBut wait, actually, no. Because each term in the product will be of the form \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{-k}\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to consider all the terms in the second part and sum their coefficients.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. Because when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part.\n\nBut that can't be, because the second part isn't a constant; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second part, which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the same as the coefficient in the first part multiplied by each term in the second part, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), that would mean that the coefficient is the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part, which would make it a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any reference to \\(c\\). That seems confusing.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, they are treating the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and they want the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is whatever it is. But in the expression, \\(c\\) is involved in the second part, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient, without specifying any particular power of \\(c\\). That seems odd.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written in a way that it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but without any specific power. So, the coefficient would be a term that includes \\(c\\) raised to some power. But that doesn't make much sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that's independent of \\(c\\). Wait, no, because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a sum of terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\).\n\nBut the problem is asking for \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which is a bit ambiguous. It could mean the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Alternatively, it could mean the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but the problem doesn't specify. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It just says \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe they're treating \\(c\\) as another variable and just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times whatever power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems a bit odd because usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term in a product, you specify all variables. Maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a single polynomial, and they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be a term that includes \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But that seems unlikely because usually, the coefficient is a numerical factor. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering the entire expression, so the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) for each term. But I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify. Let me consider that the entire expression is a product of two separate polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and one in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the terms are products of terms from each polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first polynomial, and it's multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which suggests it's a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when the entire expression is expanded, considering all variables. But that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is only part of the variables; the other part is \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some term in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem doesn't specify which term in \\(c\\). Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I need to check if the problem was written correctly. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that it's the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But that's not correct because the second part isn't a constant; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from the first part times each term in the second part, which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so I'm confused.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible terms, but that seems unclear. Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a numerical value. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term from the second part.\n\nLet me assume that for a moment. So, if that's the case, then the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me check if that makes sense.\n\nFirst, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The constant term is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, let's expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\):\n\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies 2k = 6 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\):\n\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\binom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nSo, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nBut wait, the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), it just said \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I'm overcomplicating again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is written in a way that the entire expression is considered, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a sum over all terms in the second part multiplied by 6.\n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some specific power of \\(c\\), but it's not specified.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that it's the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second part. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a number. So, perhaps the problem is actually a misstatement, and it's supposed to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's not specified.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written correctly, and the answer is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number. So, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is written in a way that the entire expression is considered, and we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but in the context of the entire product, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems odd because usually, coefficients are numerical.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But the sum of all coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\nSo, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that seems high, and I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). But that seems too simplistic, and I don't think that's the case because the problem includes both parts.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think differently. When you have two separate polynomials multiplied together, like \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the terms in the product are the products of terms from each polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first polynomial, and it's multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. Therefore, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from the first part multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), specifically \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's not a number; it's a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some specific power of \\(c\\), but it's not specified.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). But that's not a number either.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1)^6\\), but that's just a guess. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean that it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, as I calculated earlier, giving 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number, so that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). But that seems too simplistic, and I don't think that's the case because the problem includes both parts.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that it's 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that's a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering only the terms where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number.\n\nSo, let me proceed under that assumption. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As I calculated earlier, the constant term is 20, so the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. Let me expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and find the constant term. As I did earlier, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nThe term where the exponent is zero is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\), as I found earlier.\n\nSo, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 6 times 20, which is 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, without considering \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, but that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number.\n\nTherefore, I think the intended answer is 120, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), i.e., \\(a^2b^2c^0\\).\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6.\n\n2. Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20.\n\n3.

Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, let me break this down. First, the expression is a product of two binomial expansions: one involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since the variables \\(a, b, c\\) are all different, the coefficients in one part shouldn't interfere with the other. So maybe I can handle each part separately and then multiply the results?\n\nLet me start with the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion. I remember that when expanding a binomial like \\((x + y)^n\\), the coefficient of \\(x^k y^{n - k}\\) is given by the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{n}{k}\\). So in this case, \\(n = 4\\), and I want \\(k = 2\\) because I want \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the same as \\(a^2b^{4 - 2}\\). \n\nCalculating the binomial coefficient: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that. 4 choose 2 is equal to \\(\\frac{4!}{2! \\cdot (4 - 2)!} = \\frac{24}{2 \\cdot 2} = \\frac{24}{4} = 6\\). So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, I need to find the coefficient of something here, but wait, the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is the product of both expansions. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient from the second binomial expansion should be 1, right? Because any term not involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) would just be 1 when multiplied by the terms from the first expansion. \n\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure. The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{6 - k}\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{k - (6 - k)} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{2k - 6}\\). \n\nBut since the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), I need to find the term in the second expansion where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because \\(c^0 = 1\\), which doesn't affect the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). \n\nSo, I need to solve for \\(k\\) in the equation \\(2k - 6 = 0\\). Let's do that:\n\n\\(2k - 6 = 0\\)\n\nAdding 6 to both sides:\n\n\\(2k = 6\\)\n\nDividing both sides by 2:\n\n\\(k = 3\\)\n\nSo, the term where \\(k = 3\\) will give me \\(c^0\\), which is 1. The coefficient for this term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that:\n\n\\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\frac{6!}{3! \\cdot (6 - 3)!} = \\frac{720}{6 \\cdot 6} = \\frac{720}{36} = 20\\). \n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, 6! is 720, but 3! is 6, so 720 divided by (6 * 6) is 720/36, which is indeed 20. So the coefficient is 20. \n\nBut hold on, let me double-check because sometimes I get confused with factorials. Alternatively, I can compute \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) as 6 * 5 * 4 / (3 * 2 * 1) = 120 / 6 = 20. Yep, that's correct. So the coefficient for the term \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. \n\nNow, since the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the product of the coefficients from each part. \n\nSo, from the first part, we have 6, and from the second part, we have 20. Multiplying them together: 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Did I correctly identify the terms? Let me see. \n\nIn the first expansion, \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6, which is correct because \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). \n\nIn the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(c^0\\) is indeed when \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is 20. \n\nSince the two parts are multiplied together, the coefficients multiply as well, so 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI don't see any mistake here. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of the constant term \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Hmm, okay, so I think I need to find the coefficient of a specific term in a product of two binomial expressions. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me consider the expression \\((a + b)^4\\). I know that when expanding a binomial like this, each term is given by the binomial theorem, which states that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^{k}\\). So, applying this to \\((a + b)^4\\), each term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\).\n\nNow, I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. Let me set up the equation for that. The exponent of \\(a\\) is \\(4 - k\\) and the exponent of \\(b\\) is \\(k\\). So, I need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). That makes sense because \\(4 - 2 = 2\\). So, the term corresponding to \\(k = 2\\) will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2 b^2\\).\n\nCalculating the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), I remember that \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} = \\dfrac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\\). So, plugging in the values, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part of the expression, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I notice that this part involves \\(c\\) and its reciprocal, so the terms in this expansion will involve various powers of \\(c\\). However, since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think I need to find the term in the second binomial that doesn't contribute any \\(c\\) terms, i.e., the constant term. Because when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by this term, it will just multiply the coefficients and not affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms.\n\nWait, actually, no. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product of both expansions. So, perhaps I need to consider each part separately and then multiply their coefficients because the terms from each part are independent.\n\nWait, but no, the entire expression is the product of the two binomials. So, when I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), each term is a combination of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and when I expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is a combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion.\n\nBut since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think I need to find the term in the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term, because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by that constant term, I get a term that only has \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me apply the binomial theorem here as well. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).\n\nSimplifying the exponents, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\cdot c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nI need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), I get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the term where \\(m = 3\\) will be the constant term. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720 divided by (6 * 6) is 720 / 36, which is indeed 20. So, the coefficient is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20.\n\nNow, since the overall expression is the product of the two expansions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, that's 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but I'm considering the entire product. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the product will be a term from the first expansion times a term from the second expansion.\n\nSince I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), I need to find all possible ways to get \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), because any other power of \\(c\\) would make the term not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion by the \\(c^0\\) term from the second expansion.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, that's correct.\n\nIn the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent is 0, so 6 - 2m = 0, so m = 3, and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. That's correct.\n\nSo, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing any other terms that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). For example, could there be other terms in the second expansion that, when multiplied by terms from the first expansion, result in \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, no, because any term in the second expansion that isn't \\(c^0\\) would introduce a \\(c\\) term, which would make the term have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so it wouldn't be just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, only the constant term from the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion, gives the desired term.\n\nTherefore, I think my answer is correct: the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely thorough, let me think about the entire expansion. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when expanded, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, for a term to have \\(a^2b^2\\), we must have \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as I found earlier. So, that's fixed, and the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nThen, for the second part, we need \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\) to be \\(c^0\\), which requires \\(m = 3\\), as I found. So, the coefficient from the second part is 20.\n\nTherefore, the term is \\(6 \\times 20 \\times a^2b^2c^0 = 120 a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2 b^2\n   \\]\n   Calculating the binomial coefficient:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   We need the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) in this expansion.

    "text": " Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can find the coefficients using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem states that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, in this case, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\), so I can expand that part to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nLet me write that out. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). That means the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the problem is about the product of two expressions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire product. However, the term we're interested in is \\(a^2b^2\\), which only comes from the first part of the product, \\((a + b)^4\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), involves variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when we multiply the two parts together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the second expression.\n\nWait a minute, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but it doesn't specify any particular term involving \\(c\\). So, does that mean we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the terms involving \\(c\\)? Or are we supposed to consider the entire product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some term in \\(c\\)?\n\nLooking back at the problem statement: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It seems like it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would include all possible terms from the second expression. But actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by something else. So, perhaps we're supposed to collect all the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make much sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It might mean that we're to find the coefficient of the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the question is asking for a coefficient, which is a single number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some term involving \\(c\\). But since the problem doesn't specify a particular term with \\(c\\), maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and that's it. But that seems too simple.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and when you expand the entire expression, each term will have powers of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, because each term in the second part will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nBut that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because coefficients are typically constants. So, perhaps the problem is miswritten, or I'm misunderstanding it. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, so the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we might be implicitly assuming that the term is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), so that the entire term is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, let me break it down into two parts:\n\n1. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\).\n2. Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\).\n\nOkay, let's start with the first part, which I already did: it's 6.\n\nNow, for the second part: the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nAgain, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me calculate it again:\n\n6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 6!/(3!3!) = 720/(6*6) = 720/36 = 20. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", not \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would mean considering all possible terms from the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a single coefficient.\n\nBut that can't be, because coefficients are numerical. So, perhaps the problem is assuming that we're only looking for the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\), so that the term is just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think differently. When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which is not a single number.\n\nBut the problem is asking for \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which suggests that it's looking for a single number, not a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps the problem is assuming that we're looking for the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, i.e., \\(c^0\\), so that the term is just \\(a^2b^2\\), and the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we're supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but since it's not specified, perhaps it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and when you multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term from the second expression, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. But that's not correct because each term is multiplied individually.\n\nWait, no, the coefficients don't add up like that. Each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times each term from the second expression, but that's not a single coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the other variables, meaning that we're treating \\(c\\) as another variable and just looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, which would have a coefficient that is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for \"the coefficient\", implying a single number.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering only the terms where \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out, meaning \\(c^0\\). So, that would be the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's the most plausible interpretation. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20. So, when you multiply these two parts, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, giving a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120 for the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break it down into two parts:\n\n1. **Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Again, using the binomial theorem, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the two coefficients together:**\n   \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Hmm, okay, so I think I need to expand these expressions and then find the term where the exponents of a and b are both 2. But wait, actually, the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I don't need to worry about the other terms? Let me think.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can use the binomial theorem to expand it. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^{k}\\). So, in this case, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion will have terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). Each of these terms has coefficients determined by the binomial coefficients.\n\nSince the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can focus on the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), because \\(n = 4\\) and \\(k = 2\\) (since \\(b^2\\) is the term we're interested in). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nBut wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think the coefficient I just found for \\(a^2b^2\\) is just part of the overall expression. The other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which also needs to be expanded. But here's the thing: since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, I don't think we need to consider how the other part affects the coefficient. Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is a product, so when we multiply the two expansions together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will multiply each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what happens with the c terms, we can treat the c part as a separate factor that doesn't affect the a and b coefficients. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nLet me clarify. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are only in the second part, the terms in the first part don't involve \\(c\\), and vice versa. So, when we multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the coefficients from the second part multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. Wait, that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part? But that can't be because the problem is asking for a single coefficient, not an expression.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, the expression is a product of two binomials, each raised to a power. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first part, so when we multiply by the second part, which involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we need to find the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), result in terms that still have \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but that's not possible because the second part only involves \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by, say, \\(c^k\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is a different term. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the a and b terms. Therefore, the coefficient remains 6.\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, if I expand each part separately, I have:\n\nFirst part: \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nSecond part: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, the second part expands to terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply the two expansions together, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(15a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(20a^2b^2\\), \\(15a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\).\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term where the exponents of a and b are 2 and 2, respectively. However, in the terms I just listed, the only term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) without any c terms is \\(20a^2b^2\\). The other terms have c exponents, so they are different terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 20, because that's the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but hold on. I thought earlier that the coefficient was 6, but now I'm getting 20. So, which one is correct? Let me go through it step by step.\n\nFirst, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I calculated before. Now, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has a constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) of 20, because when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), then \\(k = 3\\), so the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\\). Therefore, when I multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term (which has coefficient 6) by the constant term 20, I get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, but only the constant term in the second part (which is 20) will result in a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any c terms. The other terms in the second part will introduce c exponents, so they won't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) to find the constant term, which is 20.\n\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, I need to consider how this product affects the coefficient.\n\nHmm, so I think I need to multiply the two expansions together. But actually, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which involves \\(c\\) terms, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe it's just the coefficient times 1? Wait, that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but actually, no, because when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because then it would be a single number, but actually, each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a term with some power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you just get \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\), each with their own coefficients. So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean we're only looking for the term where the power of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is 2 each, regardless of the power of \\(c\\)? Or does it mean the term where the variables are exactly \\(a^2b^2\\) and no \\(c\\) terms? Hmm, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, I think it's referring to the term where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) contributes a coefficient that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first expansion.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients from each polynomial whose variables multiply to give that term. But in this case, the variables in the first polynomial are \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and in the second polynomial, they are \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get multiple terms with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then yes, each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) contributes a coefficient that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all terms would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. When you have two separate variables, the coefficient of a term involving only \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) would indeed be the product of the coefficients from each part, because the variables are independent. So, yes, I think that's correct.\n\nBut let me verify this by another approach. Let's expand both expressions separately and then see how the terms multiply.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\) expands to:\n\\[\na^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6.\n\nNext, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as:\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nSo, the terms are:\n- When \\(k = 0\\): \\(\\binom{6}{0} c^6 = 1 \\cdot c^6\\)\n- \\(k = 1\\): \\(\\binom{6}{1} c^4 = 6c^4\\)\n- \\(k = 2\\): \\(\\binom{6}{2} c^2 = 15c^2\\)\n- \\(k = 3\\): \\(\\binom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\\)\n- \\(k = 4\\): \\(\\binom{6}{4} c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(k = 5\\): \\(\\binom{6}{5} c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(k = 6\\): \\(\\binom{6}{6} c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which has a coefficient of 6, it will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6*1, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 6*6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^2\\) is 6*15, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6*20, and so on.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, does that mean regardless of the power of \\(c\\), or specifically when the power of \\(c\\) is zero? Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's just 6*20.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean the term where \\(c\\) is to the zero power, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term with no \\(c\\) involved. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. So, 6*20 = 120.\n\nWait, that makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the term \\(c^0\\) (which is 20), you get \\(a^2b^2 * 20\\), so the coefficient is 120.\n\nBut earlier I thought it was 384, but that was when considering all coefficients. But the problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that it's the term where the variables are exactly \\(a^2b^2\\), meaning no \\(c\\) terms, so \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the correct coefficient is 6*20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. If the problem had said the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), then it would be different. But as it is, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), so we're looking for the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) in it, which isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, to clarify, in the product, each term is a combination of \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only include the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) in it, making it \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), not just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6*20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose the problem had said \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion\", without specifying any \\(c\\) terms. Then, in the context of the entire expansion, which includes \\(c\\) terms, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only appear when multiplied by \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, you'd have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, yes, the coefficient is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had said \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all powers of \\(c\\)\", then it would be 384. But as it's written, it's just \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which implies only the term where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared and \\(c\\) is to the zero power.\n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\). When I multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). But if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then we're looking for the sum of all those coefficients. Wait, but that would be 6*(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6*64 = 384.\n\nBut now I'm confused because earlier I thought it was 120. So, which is it?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, meaning the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, it would be 6*(sum of coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)), which is 6*64 = 384.\n\nBut if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6*20 = 120.\n\nI think the problem is ambiguous, but given the way it's phrased, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean 384.\n\nBut let me think again. If I have a product of two expressions, say (P)(Q), where P is in terms of a and b, and Q is in terms of c, then the coefficient of a term like a^2b^2 in P*Q would be the coefficient of a^2b^2 in P multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q, because each term in Q contributes a coefficient that, when multiplied by a^2b^2, gives a term with a^2b^2 and some power of c. So, the total coefficient for a^2b^2 across all terms in the product would be 6*(sum of coefficients in Q).\n\nBut if the problem is asking for the coefficient of a^2b^2c^0, then it's just 6*(coefficient of c^0 in Q).\n\nI think the key is to interpret the problem correctly. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, in the context of the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be part of terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), where k is any integer. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of c, then it's 6*(sum of coefficients in Q). If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6*(coefficient of c^0 in Q).\n\nBut in the absence of any mention of c, I think it's more likely that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible powers of c, which would mean 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1 = (a + b)(c + 1/c) = ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is c + 1/c, but if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) regardless of c, it's just 1*(c + 1/c), but if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^0\\), it's 1*1 = 1.\n\nBut in our problem, it's similar. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of c, then it's 6*(sum of coefficients in Q). If it's asking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6*20 = 120.\n\nI think the problem is ambiguous, but in most cases, when someone asks for the coefficient of a term in a product of expressions with different variables, they are considering the term where the other variables are at zero power. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 120.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me check both interpretations.\n\nFirst interpretation: Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c. Then, it's 6*(sum of coefficients in Q) = 6*64 = 384.\n\nSecond interpretation: Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Then, it's 6*20 = 120.\n\nBut let's think about how the problem is presented. It's written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the variables involved are a, b, c, and 1/c. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the expansion, but when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), it will be part of terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's likely that it's considering all possible k, meaning the sum of coefficients from Q multiplied by 6.\n\nBut wait, in the product, each term is a product of a term from the first polynomial and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. Therefore, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6*1, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 6*6, etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually 6*(sum of coefficients in Q), which is 6*64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, no, that's not correct because the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is different from the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of c, then it's the sum of all coefficients of terms where a and b are squared, regardless of c. So, that would be 6*(sum of coefficients in Q) = 384.\n\nBut if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's just 6*20 = 120.\n\nI think the confusion arises from whether the problem is considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) as a standalone term (which would require c to be at zero power) or as part of any term where a and b are squared, regardless of c.\n\nGiven that the problem is written as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without any mention of c, I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of c. Therefore, the answer would be 384.\n\nBut to be absolutely sure, let me think about how the product is structured. The product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be seen as a polynomial in four variables: a, b, c, and 1/c. But when you expand it, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{-m}\\), where k ranges from 0 to 4, and m ranges based on the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nTherefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would appear in the product as \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (without any c terms) is just the coefficient from the first expansion (6) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion (20), giving 120.\n\nBut if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c, meaning across all terms where a and b are squared, then it's 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64 = 384.\n\nI think the key here is to understand whether \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the product refers to the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\) or the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present with any power of c.\n\nGiven that in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in multiple terms with \\(a^2b^2\\) and different powers of c, the problem is likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c, which would be 384.\n\nBut I'm still a bit uncertain because sometimes problems specify the exact term, including all variables. But in this case, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's safer to assume that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, meaning the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of c.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with another approach. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6*64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the answer is 384.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought it was 120, but now I'm convinced it's 384. I think the confusion was about whether the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all powers of c, or just the term where c is zero. Given that the problem doesn't specify any c terms, it's more likely asking for the total coefficient across all c terms, which is 384.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in the second expression is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n$\\boxed{384}$"

    "text": " Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with expressions like \\((a + b)^n\\), the coefficients of specific terms can be found using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem states that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^{k}\\). So, for the part \\((a + b)^4\\), I can expand it using this theorem.\n\nLet me write that out. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion will have terms from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(k = 4\\). The general term is \\(\\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\). I'm interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That happens when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = \\frac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Okay, that part seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) because when I multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not involving \\(c\\), I think I might have misunderstood. Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is the product, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is just part of the expansion, and the rest involves \\(c\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), I think that the coefficient is just 6 multiplied by whatever comes from the second part when \\(a^2b^2\\) is taken.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But in the product, each term is a combination of a term from the first binomial expansion and a term from the second binomial expansion. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Therefore, in the entire product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me clarify. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), when expanded, gives terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), etc. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, gives terms involving \\(c^6\\), \\(c^5\\), \\(c^4\\), ..., \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^5\\), ..., \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only has \\(a^2b^2\\) and no \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Therefore, the only term in the product that has exactly \\(a^2b^2\\) is when the term from the second expansion is \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part.\n\nSo, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, the general term is \\(\\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\binom{6}{3} = \\frac{6!}{3!3!} = \\frac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\frac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the constant term in the second part. From the first part, we found the coefficient to be 6, and from the second part, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the overall coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply the two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, but only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero will result in a term that is \\(a^2b^2\\) times 1, which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms will have additional factors of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so they won't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the only contribution comes from the constant term in the second part, which is 20, and the coefficient from the first part is 6, so 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nBut let me double-check my reasoning. Suppose I expand both expressions separately and then multiply them. The first expansion gives me terms up to \\(a^4b^0\\), and the second expansion gives me terms with various powers of \\(c\\). When I multiply them, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero will result in a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms will have extra factors of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so they won't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, yes, only the constant term in the second expansion affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nSo, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives us 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is also found using the binomial theorem, resulting in 20. Multiplying these together gives the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression as \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " \n\nHmm, okay, so I think I need to expand both parts separately and then multiply them together, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me consider the expression \\((a + b)^4\\). I remember that when expanding a binomial like this, I can use the binomial theorem, which says that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^{k}\\). So, applying this to \\((a + b)^4\\), each term will be of the form \\(\\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4.\n\nI specifically need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let me find the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. That would mean \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = \\frac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm not sure if I need to expand this part as well, but maybe I do because the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire product.\n\nWait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\). So, does that mean that when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since the second expression doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but that might not be correct because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion could contribute to different terms when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but actually, no. Because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\).\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the product, that term would be \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but that seems a bit off. Let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), right? So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients is 64.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm wrong, and the coefficient remains 6 because the other part doesn't affect \\(a^2b^2\\). But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term in the second expansion gets multiplied by each term in the first. So, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion, but when you collect like terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but actually, when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each factor. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first factor, and the second factor is in terms of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first factor times the entire second factor's expansion. But that can't be, because the second factor's expansion has multiple terms, each of which would contribute to different terms in the product.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing the problem. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, when I expand the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient from the first part is 6, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm wrong because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would only come from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part multiplied by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) in the second part. Because any other term in the second part would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would only be the coefficient from the first part times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, I think I made a mistake earlier by considering all coefficients. Actually, only the constant term in the second expansion, which is the term where \\(c^0\\), would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. All other terms would result in terms involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so they wouldn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, let's correct that. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWe already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, each term in the expansion is \\(\\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\binom{6}{3} = \\frac{6!}{3!3!} = \\frac{720}{6*6} = \\frac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, I think I initially made a mistake by considering the sum of all coefficients, but actually, only the constant term contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. So, the correct coefficient is 120.\n\nLet me just double-check that. The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives the constant term with coefficient 20. So, when you multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, giving a coefficient of 6*20=120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the entire product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, but only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. All other terms will have \\(c\\) raised to some power and won't contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, yes, I think the correct coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts: expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) and finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{4}{2} a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   Calculating the binomial coefficient:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, each term in the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{6}{3} = \\frac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients found in the two parts:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^k\\). So, for our case, where \\(n = 4\\), the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\).\n\nBut we're specifically looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which term corresponds to \\(a^2b^2\\)? Well, the general term is \\(\\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, if we set \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\). That means the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\), which is 4! / (2! * (4 - 2)!) = (24) / (2 * 2) = 24 / 4 = 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. That part seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the problem is a bit more complex because the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, we have two separate parts multiplied together: one involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). \n\nWait a minute, but the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term is in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two together, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion.\n\nBut since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, and the second part is multiplied as a whole, does that mean the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times the entire second part? Wait, no, that can't be right because the second part is also an expansion, so it's a sum of terms. But actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. However, since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the only term in the second expansion that affects this is the term where the power of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancels out, or more precisely, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire sum of the second expansion? Wait, that doesn't make sense because each term in the second expansion is a separate term, so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but the original problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Hmm, that seems confusing.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 (the coefficient from the first part) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, which doesn't seem right because each term in the second expansion has its own variable, \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they become different terms.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just one term, and when multiplied by the second expansion, it would create multiple terms each with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, unless the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, but that seems unlikely because the question is only about \\(a^2b^2\\), not involving \\(c\\).\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all the terms in the second expansion? But that doesn't seem correct because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too straightforward, and I might be making a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would only be the term where \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) combine to 1, so that the entire term is \\(a^2b^2\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because \\(c^0\\) is 1, so that term would be \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1\\). So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by 6.\n\nYes, that makes more sense. Because if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, I need to consider only the terms where the \\(c\\) parts cancel out, i.e., where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, let's calculate the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\), which is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20, and thus the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(k=3\\) is \\(\\binom{6}{3} c^{6 - 6} = 20 c^0 = 20\\). So, yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, to make sure I'm not making a mistake, let me think of it another way. The entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, that would mean we're looking for all terms where the exponent of \\(a\\) is 2, the exponent of \\(b\\) is 2, and the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) result in a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), i.e., \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\) term in the second expansion), giving 120.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. This happens when \\(k = 3\\), giving \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), the coefficient of a specific term like \\(a^kb^{n-k}\\) can be found using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that each term in the expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} a^k b^{n-k}\\), where \\(\\dbinom{n}{k}\\) is the binomial coefficient, which can be calculated as \\(\\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\\).\n\nSo, applying this to the first part of our problem, which is \\((a + b)^4\\). We need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Here, \\(n = 4\\), and \\(k = 2\\) because we want \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the binomial coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = \\frac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), not \\(c\\). So, does this second part affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)?\n\nHmm, let me think. The expression is a product of two parts: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them together, each term in the expansion will be a product of a term from the first part and a term from the second part.\n\nBut since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, and the second part involves \\(c\\), which doesn't interact with \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), maybe the coefficient from the second part doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, but actually, when you multiply, you have to consider all possible terms from the second part, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps we can treat the second part as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\nWait, that might not be correct. Let me clarify: when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to find how many times \\(a^2b^2\\) appears when we multiply by each term from the second expression. But wait, the second expression is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when we multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other terms are in \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient from the second part just gets multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. So, if the second part is a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times whatever the value of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) isn't a constant; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that seems too broad.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the context of the entire expression, which includes \\(c\\). So, maybe the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient isn't a single number but an expression in terms of \\(c\\). Hmm, that seems possible.\n\nWait, but the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm supposed to consider the coefficient in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that's a polynomial in \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient when considering only \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the rest is treated as constants.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me check the problem again: it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the product, and the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part.\n\nWait, but the first part gives the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as 6, and the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has various terms. So, when you multiply 6 by each term from the second part, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times each term from the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is not a single number but an expression in terms of \\(c\\).\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but then the coefficient would be an expression involving \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only concerned with the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts, and the \\(c\\) terms are considered as separate, so the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of all terms from the second part, but that doesn't make sense because each term in the second part is separate.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that for each term in the product, the coefficient is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, but that doesn't seem right because the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), whose expansion includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\).\n\nWait, so if I multiply each term from the first part by each term from the second part, then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(6c^6a^2b^2\\), \\(6 \\times 6 c^4 a^2b^2\\), and so on. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients from the second part multiplied by 6. But that would give a coefficient that is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a numerical value.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to approach it differently. Perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all terms, but since \\(c\\) is another variable, the coefficient would be an expression in terms of \\(c\\). But the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps I'm supposed to treat \\(c\\) as a separate variable and find the coefficient in terms of \\(c\\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. But wait, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me check that again. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), which is the sum of all coefficients in that expansion. So, if I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by 64, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems correct if the problem is asking for the coefficient when considering all possible \\(c\\) terms. However, I'm not sure if that's the intended interpretation.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6, as that's the coefficient from the first part, and the second part is treated as a constant. But that doesn't make sense because the second part isn't a constant; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\).\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to think of it as a product of two independent expansions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and each term in the second part is multiplied by this term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is only considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and treating the \\(c\\) part as separate, so the coefficient would just be 6, and the \\(c\\) terms are part of the expression but not affecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But that seems incorrect because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times each term from the second part, resulting in multiple terms, each with a different power of \\(c\\).\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^6\\) or something similar, but as it stands, it's \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, maybe the intended answer is just 6, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let me try to approach it differently. Suppose I consider the entire expression as a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and one in \\(c\\). So, when I multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems odd because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a number.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in multiple terms.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 64, as I thought earlier, leading to 384.\n\nBut let me check that again. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so that's \\( (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, if I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by 64, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible \\(c\\) terms.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, then it's 6. But given that the problem includes the second part, I think the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let's think of the product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by each of these coefficients from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) would be 6 * 1 = 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) would be 6 * 6 = 36, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^2\\) would be 6 * 15 = 90, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (without any \\(c\\) terms) would be 6 * 20 = 120, and so on for the negative powers of \\(c\\).\n\nBut the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is only interested in the term where the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is the term \\(20\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but in the entire product, the only term where \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't multiplied by any \\(c\\) terms is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is the term \\(20\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me check that. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times each coefficient from the second expansion. But if we're only looking for the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, then the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we're considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would give a polynomial in \\(c\\). But I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient when considering the term where the \\(c\\) exponents cancel out, so the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, let me verify this. Let's consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the exponent to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(c\\) cancels out is when \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nSo, in the second part, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, when we multiply by the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of the products of the coefficients from each part where the term is \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term from the second part.\n\nBut if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without considering the \\(c\\) terms, then it's ambiguous. However, given that the second part involves \\(c\\), it's likely that the problem is asking for the coefficient when the \\(c\\) terms are such that they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, i.e., when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a constant multiplier, but that doesn't seem right because the second part isn't a constant; it's a polynomial.\n\nWait, but if I consider the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms multiplied by 6. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's the intended interpretation.\n\nWait, let me think again. If I have two polynomials, \\(P(a, b) = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(Q(c) = \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then their product is \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\). So, each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all coefficients from \\(Q(c)\\) multiplied by 6. But since \\(Q(c)\\) has multiple terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times each term in \\(Q(c)\\), leading to a polynomial in \\(c\\).\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient when the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, i.e., when \\(c\\) cancels out. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(Q(c)\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nThat makes sense, and I think that's the intended answer.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6.\n2. Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20.\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is given by the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = \\frac{24}{4} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The general term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\).\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part.\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that each term in the expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\), where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to \\(n\\). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nIn this problem, the expression is \\((a + b)^4\\), so \\(n = 4\\). I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me see, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) because \\(a^{4 - 2}b^2 = a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part is 6.\n\nNow, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, I'm not sure how this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, maybe I need to consider the entire expression. So, the entire expression is the product of two parts: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), might contribute other terms involving \\(c\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the second part doesn't affect it? Or does it?\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply the two expressions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all, that would mean that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) must be multiplied by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), right? Because if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term involving \\(c\\), like \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), it would result in a term like \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1/c\\), which are not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we only want the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, meaning the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.\n\nSo, to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. Let me write that out. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, it becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, is that right? Let me check: 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720 divided by (6 * 6) is 720 / 36, which is indeed 20. So, the constant term is 20.\n\nSo, now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6. In the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. When we multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will multiply the constant term 20 from the second part, giving us a term \\(a^2b^2 \\times 20\\), so the coefficient is 20 * 6 = 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. Let me just recap to ensure I didn't overlook anything. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of two expressions: one involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other involving \\(c\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only consider the part of the product where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term from the \\(c\\) expression, which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations. The binomial coefficients were calculated properly, and the exponents for \\(c\\) were handled correctly. So, I think the coefficient is indeed 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by multiplying the binomial coefficients from each part. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) has a coefficient of 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Hmm, okay, so I think I need to expand both parts separately and then multiply them together, but maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nLet me start by recalling the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that for any positive integer \\(n\\), \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^k\\). So maybe I can apply this to both \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nFirst, let me focus on \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6 for the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, this expansion would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, it becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWait, so each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, since we're multiplying this by \\((a + b)^4\\), which has terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), maybe the \\(c\\) terms won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) coefficient because they're in different variables. Hmm, actually, no, because when we multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression.\n\nBut wait, actually, the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps I can consider that the \\(c\\) terms just contribute a scalar multiple, and the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is multiplied by the entire second part. But that doesn't seem right because the second part is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), so when multiplied, each term from the first part would be multiplied by each term from the second part.\n\nWait, but actually, no. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But the entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is a monomial in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a monomial in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when multiplied together, the product will have terms that are products of these monomials. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the only way a term can have \\(a^2b^2\\) is if it comes from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) by any term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents.\n\nWait, so that means that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\) etc., but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, so perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing their own coefficients.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384? Hmm, that seems high. Let me check.\n\nWait, no, maybe not. Because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which are \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) contributes its own coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, so the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64, as I thought earlier, because when \\(c = 1\\), \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me verify this because I'm a bit unsure. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a scalar, so when you multiply the entire \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion. But that seems like it's adding up all the coefficients, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have (a + b)^2 times (c + 1/c)^1. Then, the coefficient of a^2b^2 would be 1 (from (a + b)^2) times (1 + 1) = 2, so 1 * 2 = 2. But in reality, expanding it, it's (a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c) = a^2c + a^2/c + 2ab c + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c. So, the coefficient of a^2b^2 isn't present because there's no a^2b^2 term. Wait, that contradicts my earlier conclusion.\n\nWait, so in that example, my method would have given 1 * 2 = 2, but in reality, there is no a^2b^2 term because the other part is only to the first power. So, maybe my approach is wrong.\n\nWait, so perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients. That seems incorrect because in the example, the sum of the coefficients is 2, but the coefficient of a^2b^2 is zero because the other part doesn't have a term that would combine with a^2b^2.\n\nWait, so maybe my initial approach was wrong. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that when multiplying two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, in the problem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the second polynomial is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), but since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second polynomial. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial, not a scalar. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a scalar, so I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But in my earlier example, that approach didn't work because when I had \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) should be zero, but according to that method, it would be 1 * 2 = 2, which is incorrect.\n\nWait, so perhaps that method is wrong. So, maybe I need a different approach.\n\nLet me think again: when you have two separate variables, the coefficients in one part don't affect the coefficients in the other part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a scalar coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient in the entire product, but that's not possible because the product is a polynomial in three variables, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would involve terms with various powers of \\(c\\). So, maybe the problem is misstated, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding it.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), meaning that we can ignore the \\(c\\) terms and just find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut in my earlier example, that approach didn't work because in \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 1 times 2, which is 2, but when you expand it, there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term because the second part only has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so the product would have terms like \\(a^2c\\), \\(a^2/c\\), etc., but no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, that suggests that the approach is wrong.\n\nWait, so maybe the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem as stated only mentions \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be incorrect because \\(c\\) is also part of the expression. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering only the terms where \\(c\\) is raised to a specific power, but the problem doesn't specify that. So, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in my earlier example, that approach didn't hold because the product didn't have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is indeed 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check another example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion is \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1, and when multiplied by the second part, it would give terms like \\(ac + a/c\\), but there's no \\(a^1b^0c^0\\) term, so the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the entire product is zero, not 1 times 2.\n\nWait, so that suggests that the approach of multiplying the coefficient from the first part by the sum of coefficients from the second part is incorrect because the sum of coefficients includes terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't combine to give a constant term. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is different.\n\nWait, so maybe I need to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero would contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term when multiplied together.\n\nWait, that makes sense because if you have \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), those would be separate terms, but the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, let's compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial expansion, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that seems more reasonable. Let me check this with my earlier example. If I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 1, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is zero because \\((c + 1/c)^1\\) has terms \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), no constant term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 1 * 0 = 0, which matches the earlier observation that there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product.\n\nSo, that seems correct. Therefore, in the given problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let's compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Thus, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that makes sense now. So, the answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\) gives \\(m = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each expansion:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."
