    "text": " Wait, let me think again. Another way to approach this problem is to consider the entire expansion. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I expand both parts separately, the first part will have terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part will have terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When I multiply them together, each term from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part comes from the binomial expansion, as I calculated before, with coefficient 6. Now, for this term to result in a term without \\(c\\), it must be multiplied by the term in the second part that has \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. The coefficient of that term is 20, as I found earlier. So, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. Therefore, I think the coefficient is 120. But just to be thorough, let me write out the expansions more explicitly. Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), we get:\n\n- \\(a^4\\) with coefficient 1\n- \\(a^3b\\) with coefficient 4\n- \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6\n- \\(ab^3\\) with coefficient 4\n- \\(b^4\\) with coefficient 1\n\nAnd expanding \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we get:\n\n- \\(c^6\\) with coefficient 1\n- \\(c^4\\) with coefficient 6\n- \\(c^2\\) with coefficient 15\n- \\(1\\) (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) with coefficient 20\n- \\(1/c^2\\) with coefficient 15\n- \\(1/c^4\\) with coefficient 6\n- \\(1/c^6\\) with coefficient 1\n\nSo, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion (with coefficient 6) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can ignore all the terms from the second expansion that have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). The only term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is the constant term, which is 1 with coefficient 20. So, the only contribution to \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 (from the first expansion) multiplied by 20 (from the second expansion's constant term), giving 120. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120. I think that's solid. So, to recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20.\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together: 6 * 20 = 120.\n4. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nI don't think I missed anything here. The key was recognizing that only the constant term from the second expansion would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) term, which we don't want. So, yeah, 120 is the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both expansions:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.

    "text": " Wait, let me think again. Maybe I should consider the entire expansion. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), it comes from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, that would indeed be 6 times 20, which is 120. So, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I made any mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. Correct. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent is 0 is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. Correct. So, 6 times 20 is 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other way \\(a^2b^2\\) could be formed. For example, could there be a term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that, when multiplied by a term in \\((a + b)^4\\), gives \\(a^2b^2\\) without involving \\(c\\)? I don't think so because the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) is to multiply by the constant term. Any other term would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so the product would have a \\(c\\) term, which isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, only the constant term contributes. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nI think that's correct.
