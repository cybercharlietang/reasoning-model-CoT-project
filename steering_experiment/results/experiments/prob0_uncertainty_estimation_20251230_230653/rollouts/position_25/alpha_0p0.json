Because if I take any other term from the second part, it would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) term, which would make the entire product have a \\(c\\) term, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), those terms wouldn't contribute to the coefficient we're seeking. So, yes, I think that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " So, I already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to expand that. Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\cdot c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, which means \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient should be 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 is when \\(m = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when you multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, giving 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire product being \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the constant term (with respect to \\(c\\)), that is, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which is 20, as we found. So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's correct. Let me see if there's another way to approach it. Alternatively, maybe I can consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the product of the coefficients from each part, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\). So, yes, that would make sense. So, I think 120 is the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by multiplying the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1.

    "text": " Wait, so I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me figure that out. So, using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term: \\(c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that's 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (the constant term). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, let me double-check that I didn't make a mistake. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives a coefficient of 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives a constant term of 20. Multiplying them together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. Alternatively, if I think about the entire expansion, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) (which has coefficient 6) by the constant term (20), giving 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that makes sense. I don't think I made any mistakes here.

Let me think about that. The expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can also be expanded using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\).

Now, since the original expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients we found, which is 6 * 20. Let me compute that: 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Since we're multiplying these two expressions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term (c^0) from the second part, giving \\(a^2b^2 * 20\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the correct answer. But just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me go through it again. First, \\((a + b)^4\\): the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is when we choose 2 a's and 2 b's, which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\): the term with \\(c^0\\) is when the exponent from c and 1/c cancel out. So, \\(c^{6 - 2m} = c^0\\) implies \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together, 6 * 20 = 120. Yep, that seems correct. I don't think I missed anything here.
