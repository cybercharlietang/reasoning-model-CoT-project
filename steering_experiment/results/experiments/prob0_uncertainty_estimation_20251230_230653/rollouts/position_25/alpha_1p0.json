    "text": " Let me think again. So, to get the term \\(a^2b^2\\), you would take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the term that has \\(c^0\\) from the second part. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me try expanding that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient from the second part is 20.

Since when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply for the corresponding terms, so yes, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that seems right.

    "text": " Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. Let me consider the entire expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the total term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) and each term from the second polynomial. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), that would require the term from the second polynomial to have \\(c^0\\), so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, I think that's correct. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me use the binomial theorem again for this. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\cdot c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, i.e., \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) as 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from the other expansion as 20. So, when you multiply these two terms, you get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\), and the term is \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 120. Hmm, but wait, is there another way to think about this? Let me consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I were to expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would only come from the term where the second expansion contributes a \\(c^0\\) term, which we found as 20. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a product, and since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficients are independent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient in the first part times the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a constant with respect to \\(c\\), it would just be the product of the two coefficients. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have multiple variables, you have to consider cross terms, but in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the cross terms don't affect each other. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product and use generating functions. Let me try that approach. The generating function for \\((a + b)^4\\) is straightforward, and the generating function for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is also known. When you multiply two generating functions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, and multiply them together. So, that would be 6 times 20, which is 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there a possibility that when you multiply the two expansions, some other terms could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without involving \\(c\\)? For example, if the second expansion had a term with \\(c^k\\) and another term with \\(c^{-k}\\), but in reality, each term in the second expansion is either \\(c^m\\) or \\(c^{-m}\\), so when multiplied by the first expansion, each term would have a corresponding \\(c\\) term. So, the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) is to multiply by the \\(c^0\\) term from the second expansion. So, that confirms that the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. Therefore, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.

So, when we multiply the two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, giving a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by each term in \\((a + b)^4\\). But since we're only interested in the term where the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents are 2 each, we only need the constant term from the \\(c\\) part. So, yes, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me recalculate the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), correct. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), correct. So, 6 * 20 = 120, yes.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When I multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6a^2b^2. Then, in the second expression, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is 20, as we found. So, when we multiply these together, it's 6a^2b^2 * 20, which gives 120a^2b^2. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. That makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to write out the entire product, it would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} (1/c)^m\\). But since we're only interested in the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, we set \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so that term is 6a^2b^2. Then, the other factor must be the term where \\(c^{6 - 2m} = c^0\\), so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), \\(m = 3\\), which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120, which is the coefficient.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, could there be any other terms that contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by other terms from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)? For example, if I take a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) that's not \\(a^2b^2\\), would it multiply with a term from the other expression to give \\(a^2b^2\\) somehow? Hmm, no, because the other expression is in terms of \\(c\\), which is a different variable. So, when you multiply terms, the variables are separate.

    "text": " Let me check that again. Because if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part and the term that gives \\(c^0\\) in the second part. Because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, which would make the term not just \\(a^2b^2\\) but also have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient would be the product of the two coefficients. So, first, we have 6 from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part. Now, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial. So, yes, the coefficients multiply. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by considering the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**  \n   Using the binomial theorem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\) in the expansion, giving the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**  \n   We look for the term with \\(c^0\\), which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient here is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Combining the coefficients:**  \n   Multiply the two coefficients: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{120}"
