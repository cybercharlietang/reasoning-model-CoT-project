Because sometimes when you have products of polynomials, you might have multiple terms contributing to the same term in the product.

So, I think my reasoning is correct. So, yeah, the coefficient should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by considering the expansion of each part separately and then multiplying the relevant coefficients.\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2.

Simplifying the exponents: \\(c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\).

So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.

    "text": " The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, because \\(c^0\\) is 1, and that's the term we're interested in. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) and solve for \\(m\\). Let's do that: \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) \u2192 \\(2m = 6\\) \u2192 \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the one with \\(c^0\\). The coefficient for this term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Since these two terms multiply together to give the term \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0\\), the coefficient is 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, let me double-check that I didn't make a mistake in my reasoning. So, the key idea is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply when the variables match. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only take the constant term from the second polynomial, which is 20, and multiply it by the coefficient from the first polynomial, which is 6. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. I don't think I made any calculation errors. Let me just confirm the binomial coefficients: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, correct. \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20, correct. So, 6 * 20 = 120, so the coefficient is 120. Yeah, that seems right.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe are interested in the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\).
