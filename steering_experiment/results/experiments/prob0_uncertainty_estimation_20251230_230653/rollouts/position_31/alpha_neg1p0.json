We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\) so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Since these two terms multiply together in the overall expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me just double-check that. So, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply when the variables' exponents add up to the desired term. In this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0\\), so yes, the coefficients 6 and 20 multiply to give 120. I don't think I made a mistake here. So, the final answer should be 120. But just to be thorough, let me think again. So, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives me terms up to \\(a^4\\) and \\(b^4\\), and I'm taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term which is 6. Then, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives me terms with exponents from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\) in steps of 2, right? So, the exponents are 6, 4, 2, 0, -2, -4, -6. So, the term with \\(c^0\\) is when k=3, which is the middle term, and that's 20. So, when I multiply the two expansions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will multiply each term in the second expansion, but only the \\(c^0\\) term will result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times 1 (since \\(c^0 = 1\\)), so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems correct. I don't think I missed anything here. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).
