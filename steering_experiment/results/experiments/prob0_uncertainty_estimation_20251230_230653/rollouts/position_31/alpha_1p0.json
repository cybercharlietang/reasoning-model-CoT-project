Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That is, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, when we multiply these two, we get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, the expansion is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) as 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from the other expansion as 20. Since these are independent, when you multiply the two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we have to find the part of the second polynomial that's a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), because that's the only way the product won't introduce any \\(c\\) terms. So, yes, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. I think that makes sense. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.
