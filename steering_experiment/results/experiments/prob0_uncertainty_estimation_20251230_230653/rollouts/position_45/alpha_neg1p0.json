The key here is that when you multiply two polynomials, the terms combine by adding their coefficients when the variables match. In this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by the constant term from the second part. So, yes, the coefficients multiply, giving 6 * 20 = 120. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations. The binomial coefficients seem correct: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\) and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).
