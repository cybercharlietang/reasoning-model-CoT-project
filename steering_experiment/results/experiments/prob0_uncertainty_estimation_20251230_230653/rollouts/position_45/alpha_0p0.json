If I didn't consider the second polynomial, the coefficient would just be 6.

    "text": " So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility that other terms could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by the \\(c\\) terms? For example, if I take a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) that's not \\(a^2b^2\\), say \\(a^3b\\), and multiply it by a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that's, say, \\(c\\), would that result in a term involving \\(a^3b c\\), which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\), so that's fine. Similarly, any other combination would either have higher powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) or involve \\(c\\), so they wouldn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, I think my reasoning is correct. The only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial with the constant term from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient is indeed 120. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as the product of two polynomials, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, yes, 6 times 20 is 120.
