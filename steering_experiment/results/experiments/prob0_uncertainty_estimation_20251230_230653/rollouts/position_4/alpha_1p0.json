    "text": " Let me try expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) first.\n\nAlright, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Calculating the coefficients, that's \\(1a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\nWait, but the problem is about the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider both parts. Maybe I should find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and then multiply it by something from the second part. But actually, since the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), which is a different variable, maybe it doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, let me think.\n\nSo, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then each term in the expansion of the first part is multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the product terms won't interfere with each other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the entire expansion of the second part would have many terms. Maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I need to clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but the expression also has \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes a multiple to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit off. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and ignore the \\(c\\) terms because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. But that doesn't sound right either because the entire expression is a product, so every term from the first part is multiplied by every term from the second part.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but since the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), which is a different variable, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the expansion of the second part, which would give a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I need to clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, treating \\(c\\) as another variable but considering that when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), but when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all terms would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, let's calculate that. The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I set \\(c = 1\\), then it becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me check that again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) which gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) which when expanded has terms like \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, 1, c^{-2}, c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\), each with their own coefficients. So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by each coefficient from the second expansion. But wait, that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach it differently. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part and \\(c\\) is in another, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest of the terms are in \\(c\\). But the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so perhaps it's just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. Wait, that might make sense. Because when you multiply by the second part, you're effectively scaling each term by the entire second expansion, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire second expansion. But I think that's not the case because the question is just asking for the coefficient, not considering \\(c\\). Hmm, I'm confused now.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check by expanding a bit more carefully. Let's consider that \\((a + b)^4\\) has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\cdot (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k\\) from 0 to 6.\n\nNow, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion.\n\nBut wait, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any particular power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the answer is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps the answer is simply 6, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. But that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients would multiply.\n\nWait, let me think again. If I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c), then the product P(a, b) * Q(c) would have terms where each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) multiplied by the entire polynomial Q(c). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * Q(c), which is 6 times the entire expansion of Q(c). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, so maybe they want the coefficient as a polynomial in c, which would be 6 * Q(c). But that seems complicated, and the problem might just be expecting a numerical coefficient, perhaps considering that the variables are independent.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making this too complicated. Let me try another approach. Let's compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then note that the other part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms with coefficients. So, when I multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by 6.\n\nSo, to find the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, I can substitute \\(c = 1\\), as I thought earlier. So, \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with a smaller example to make sure I'm not making a mistake. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Let's compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\((a + b)^2\\) is \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually zero because in \\((a + b)^2\\), the highest power is \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\), but \\(a^2b^2\\) would require degree 4, which isn't present. So, perhaps my approach is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I should instead consider that the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps I can treat the two parts separately. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the middle term when expanded. Let me check that.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\cdot (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the constant term is 20.\n\nSo, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, then the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. But wait, that's different from my earlier answer of 384. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the problem. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would give 6 times each coefficient, leading to 6 times 64, which is 384. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) (i.e., the constant term), then it's 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nBut the problem statement is: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nBut in my smaller example, when I took \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because \\((a + b)^2\\) doesn't have \\(a^2b^2\\). But if I were to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would be zero. Alternatively, if I were to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it would be zero times the entire expansion, which is zero. Hmm, maybe that's not the best example.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it this way: When you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms that multiply together to give that specific term. So, in this case, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), you need to take the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by any term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first polynomial, and any term from the second polynomial will be a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), resulting in \\(a^2b^2\\) times each coefficient, so the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nTherefore, the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the constant term in the second polynomial is 20, so if I multiply 6 by 20, I get 120. So, which is it? Is the problem asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), or specifically the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)?\n\nLooking back at the problem statement: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me consider both interpretations:\n\n1. If the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\n2. If the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut since the problem doesn't specify the power of \\(c\\), I think the first interpretation is correct, so the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check again with the smaller example. Let's say I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion of \\((a + b)^2\\) is \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because it's not present. But if I consider the product, it's \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present because the first polynomial only goes up to \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\). So, the coefficient is zero, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, in that case, the coefficient is zero, which aligns with the idea that if the term isn't present in the first polynomial, the product won't have it either.\n\nBut in our original problem, \\((a + b)^4\\) does have \\(a^2b^2\\), so when multiplied by the second polynomial, each term in the second polynomial contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit unsure. Let me think differently. Suppose I write the entire product as:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\left(\\sum_{i=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{i} a^{4 - i}b^i\\right) \\times \\left(\\sum_{j=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{j} c^{6 - 2j}\\right)\n\\]\n\nNow, when I multiply these two sums, each term in the first sum is multiplied by each term in the second sum. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all products where \\(a^{4 - i}b^i\\) is \\(a^2b^2\\). That happens when \\(4 - i = 2\\) and \\(i = 2\\). So, the coefficient from the first sum is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, each of these is multiplied by the entire second sum, which is \\(\\sum_{j=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{j} c^{6 - 2j}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{j=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{j} c^{6 - 2j}\\). But if we are just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\), since the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is 64.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify the power of \\(c\\), so I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply to give that specific term. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), you would sum over all possible ways to get \\(a^2b^2\\) from the product. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the first polynomial, and it's multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nSo, I think I've convinced myself that the correct answer is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion is found when \\(k = 2\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, we note that each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nThe sum of the coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n\\[\n\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is:\n\\[\n6 \\times 64 = 384\n\\]\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{384}\n\\]"

    "text": " \n\nWait, the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I don't need to expand the entire expression, just focus on the part where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. Let me think. In \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from when \\(k = 2\\) in the binomial expansion, right? Because the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, if \\(k = 2\\), then the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). \n\nCalculating that binomial coefficient, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is equal to 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. But wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so does that mean I need to consider the expansion of the second part as well? \n\nI think so, because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me check that. \n\nWait, no, because if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? \n\nWait, that doesn't sound right. Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the resulting terms would have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). But the original problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Hmm, so maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That makes more sense. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply those two coefficients together. \n\nOkay, so let me break it down. First, as I found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do that, I can use the binomial theorem again. \n\nThe expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, I need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, which means \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Now, since the two parts are multiplied together, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be the product of the two coefficients, which is 6 times 20. \n\nCalculating that, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, the first part gives me 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives me 20 for \\(c^0\\), and when you multiply them, you get 120. That seems right. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about it another way. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanding, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we only want the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), then the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nI think that's correct.

    "text": " \n\nLet me focus on the first part of the expression, which is \\((a + b)^4\\). If I expand this using the binomial theorem, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. I'm specifically looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would mean \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me compute that. \n\nSo, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. But wait, the entire expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient I just found is part of a larger product. \n\nHmm, so I think I need to consider how the multiplication affects the coefficient. Let me think. When I multiply two expressions together, the coefficients of the terms multiply if the variables are the same. But in this case, the first part is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, actually, the variables are different, which means that the coefficients don't interfere with each other. \n\nWait, is that right? Let me make sure. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) is a polynomial in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\). Since they are multiplied together, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut the problem specifically asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, no, that doesn't sound right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, but the variables are separate. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part doesn't get affected by the \\(c\\) terms in the second part. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire second expression, but since the problem is asking for the coefficient, not the entire term, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. \n\nWait, no, perhaps I need to clarify: when we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, in that case, the coefficient is 6, as I found earlier, and that's it. \n\nBut wait, let me make sure. Let me think about how the multiplication works. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) expanded as a sum of terms like \\(6a^2b^2 + \\text{other terms}\\), and I multiply it by another expression which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would just be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I misunderstood the problem. Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) or something? Because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't typical. \n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that can't be right because the coefficient should be a scalar. \n\nWait, maybe I'm supposed to consider that when multiplying, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply by 6, each term in the second polynomial gets multiplied by 6, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nBut that seems a bit odd. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be interpreted as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the constant term in \\(c\\). That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is not standard. So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the constant term in \\(c\\). \n\nIf that's the case, then I need to compute two things: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply those two coefficients together to get the final coefficient. \n\nOkay, so let's do that. First, as I found, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). \n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. \n\nNow, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\)). So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm interpreting the problem correctly. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". If it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a scalar, so it's more likely that they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written in a way that it's expecting only the coefficient from the first part, but that seems unlikely because the entire expression is a product of two polynomials. So, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20, giving 120. \n\nLet me double-check my calculations. \n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\): The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). That's correct. \n\nNext, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\): The constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). That seems right. \n\nMultiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, but since the problem is asking for a coefficient, it's more likely that they want the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). \n\nSo, I think the answer is 120. \n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think about the entire expansion. When you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion of the second polynomial. \n\nBut if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion, which would be a polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a scalar. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. \n\nSo, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. This happens when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients**:\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer**: The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

That means I need to find the term in the expansion where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is also squared.

So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I think I need to consider how this part affects the coefficient. Wait, but the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Does that mean I can ignore the \\(c\\) terms when considering the coefficient? Or maybe I have to multiply the coefficients from both parts?\n\nWait, let me think. The expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the other parts (the \\(c\\) terms) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, that might not be right. Wait, no, because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part.

But that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients would multiply.\n\nWait, no, actually, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only from the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, each term from the second part would add a factor to the coefficient. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), maybe the answer is just the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part isn't a single term.

But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which would be 6 times \\(2^6\\) since each term is either \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the problem is that when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients from the second part. But that would be 6 times \\(2^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's correct.\n\nWait, maybe I'm wrong. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and its coefficient is 6. Then, when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion is a multiple of some power of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply 6 by each term in the second expansion, each term will have a coefficient of 6 times the coefficient from the second part. But the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second part because each term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times that term. But that can't be right because the sum of coefficients in the second part is when you set \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. But I'm not sure if that's what the question is asking.\n\nWait, but maybe the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is simpler. Since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present only in \\((a + b)^4\\), and when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. So, 6 times 64 is 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem might be expecting just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, but that seems unlikely because the entire product is given.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first expansion, specifically when \\(k = 2\\) in the binomial coefficient, giving \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). Now, when this is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the second expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in the second expansion has a coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) and a power of \\(c\\) as \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, we get terms like \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), because each term contributes \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{m}\\) to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\). But since the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum all the coefficients from each term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears. That is, we sum \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\).\n\nWait, but that's the same as 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\), which is 6 times \\(2^6\\), since the sum of binomial coefficients for \\(n = 6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384.\n\nWait, but that seems too large. Let me check my reasoning again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and when multiplied by each term in the second part, each of those products will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would indeed be the sum of all the contributions from each term in the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, yes, 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all the terms, but only for the specific term where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, i.e., the constant term. That would make more sense, perhaps. Let me check the problem again: it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because in the product, each term would have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, each multiplied by 6. So, 6 times 64 is indeed 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, but that seems unlikely because the entire expression is given as a product. So, I think 384 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when I expand the product, each term in the product will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\). So, that's \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we want the coefficient where \\(a^2b^2\\), so that means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for each \\(m\\) from 0 to 6, the term will be \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), which is 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion is found by considering the binomial coefficients from both parts of the expression. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) arises from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) with a coefficient of 6. When this is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Summing these contributions gives 6 multiplied by the sum of the binomial coefficients of the second expansion, which is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, that can't be right because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too high. Let me check if I'm interpreting the problem correctly.\n\nWait, no, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and not \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which are all terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems like a very large coefficient. \n\nWait, but actually, no, because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, in the product, the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) is if the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is the constant term. So, I think I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. \n\nYes, that makes more sense. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The constant term is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, using the binomial theorem again, the general term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the answer should be 120. Wait, but let me double-check that. \n\nLet me write out the steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\).\n\n2. Now, consider \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). We need the constant term (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero). \n\n3. The general term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\n4. Set the exponent equal to zero: \\(6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\\).\n\n5. The constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n6. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think about it another way. Suppose I consider the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Each term in the product will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\). \n\nBut since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for the second part, the term involving \\(c\\) can be any term, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only contribution comes from the constant term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient is 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would also be 120, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that's what they want. \n\nWait, but sometimes in these problems, they might consider terms with any power of \\(c\\), but I think in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would only come from the constant term in the \\(c\\) expansion. So, I think 120 is correct.\n\nLet me try another approach. Suppose I set \\(c = 1\\). Then, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this case would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that's different from 120. So, why the discrepancy?\n\nAh, because when I set \\(c = 1\\), I'm effectively summing all the coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion, including all powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, but no, that's not right. Because in the original expression, each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would include all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the \\(c\\) expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier conclusion of 120. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the product, and in the product, each term is a combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the \\(c\\) expansion, meaning that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut that seems to conflict with my earlier approach where I considered only the constant term. So, which approach is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so it's ambiguous whether they want the coefficient considering all possible powers of \\(c\\) or just the term where \\(c\\) is zero. Hmm.\n\nWait, in algebra, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term, like \\(a^2b^2\\), in a product of expressions, it's typically considering the term that exactly matches \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of other variables. So, in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut then again, if you consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the product, and in the product, each term is a combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all coefficients from the \\(c\\) expansion multiplied by 6. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so it's only multiplied by the constant term in the \\(c\\) expansion. So, the coefficient should be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nLet me think of a simpler example to test this. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Let's expand this: \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), and the coefficient of \\(b\\) is also \\(c + 1/c\\). So, if I were to ask for the coefficient of \\(a\\), it's \\(c + 1/c\\), not just the constant term. But if I were to ask for the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the entire product, considering all terms, it's \\(c + 1/c\\). However, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 2. But in reality, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which isn't a constant.\n\nWait, but in the problem, we're dealing with polynomials in multiple variables. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(a^2b^2/c\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually the sum of all the coefficients from the \\(c\\) expansion, multiplied by 6. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier thought. So, perhaps the confusion arises from whether the coefficient is a scalar or a polynomial. If the problem is asking for the coefficient as a polynomial, then it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient when considering all variables, then it's 6 times the sum of coefficients, which is 384.\n\nBut in the problem statement, it's written as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so I think it's expecting a numerical coefficient, considering that \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 20, giving 120.\n\nWait, but in the simple example I did earlier, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) isn't a number, but a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, if the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, then perhaps they are considering only the terms where \\(c\\) is zero, which would be the constant term.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering that \\(c\\) is an independent variable, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", implying a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, let me check the original problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of a specific term, \\(a^2b^2\\), in the product. So, in the product, each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum over all coefficients from the \\(c\\) expansion multiplied by 6. So, that would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, in the simple example, the coefficient of \\(a\\) was \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial. So, in that case, the coefficient isn't a number, but a polynomial. So, perhaps in this problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), specifically 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the \\(c\\) expansion. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think the confusion arises from whether the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), or specifically the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). \n\nGiven that the problem is written as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\), I think it's more likely that they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the sum of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in the simple example, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps in this problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a polynomial, and the answer is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too involved, and the problem is likely expecting a numerical answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut I'm getting conflicting conclusions here. Let me try to clarify.\n\nIn the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are all terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), specifically \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is usually a number. So, perhaps they are considering the coefficient when \\(c = 1\\), which would make the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\times 2^6 = (a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), meaning that it's the sum of all coefficients from the \\(c\\) expansion multiplied by 6. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut earlier, I thought it was 120 because I was considering only the constant term. So, which is it?\n\nWait, let me think about the definition. The coefficient of a term in a product of polynomials is the sum of the products of the coefficients of the terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. So, in this case, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to take the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, the problem is likely expecting the coefficient as a polynomial, but that seems unlikely because the problem is phrased as asking for a coefficient, which is typically a number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when all variables are considered, meaning that we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 times the constant term in the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 20, giving 120.\n\nI think the key here is to interpret the problem correctly. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), it's ambiguous. However, in most cases, when multiple variables are present, and you're asked for the coefficient of a term that doesn't involve another variable, it's assumed that you're looking for the term where the other variable is raised to the zero power. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient when \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power, i.e., the constant term.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but in the simple example, if I have \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), and I ask for the coefficient of \\(a\\), it's \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial. So, in that case, the coefficient isn't a number. So, perhaps in this problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a polynomial, and the answer is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems too complicated, and the problem is likely expecting a numerical answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that \\(c\\) is a variable independent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a number.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it's written as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so perhaps it's expecting the coefficient as a polynomial, meaning that the answer is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems too involved, and I don't think that's what the problem is asking for.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression as a polynomial in all variables, and they just want the coefficient, which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that's not a number, so it's unclear.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for similar problems or think about how coefficients work in multiple variables. In a polynomial with multiple variables, the coefficient of a specific term is the scalar multiplied by the variables. So, for example, in \\(a^2b^2c\\), the coefficient is 1. But in our case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all terms that are products of \\(a^2b^2\\) with any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), specifically \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut that seems too complex, and the problem is likely expecting a numerical answer. So, perhaps the problem is considering only the constant term in the \\(c\\) expansion, making the coefficient 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI'm still confused. Let me try to think of it differently. Suppose I expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) separately. Then, when I multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion and the entire second expansion. So, that would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is \\(6(c + 1/c)^6\\).\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is usually a number. So, perhaps the problem is miswritten, or I'm misinterpreting it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any mention of \\(c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is \\(6(c + 1/c)^6\\). So, unless the problem is considering \\(c\\) as a variable that's being set to 1, which would make the coefficient 6 * 64 = 384, but that's not specified.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut in that case, the coefficient would be a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps that's the intended answer.\n\nWait, but in the simple example, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial. So, unless we set \\(c = 1\\), the coefficient is a polynomial. So, perhaps in this problem, the answer is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, not a polynomial.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient when \\(c = 1\\), which would make the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 * 2^6 = (a + b)^4 * 64\\), and then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut that's not specified in the problem. So, I'm stuck between two interpretations: one where the coefficient is a polynomial, and another where it's a number obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\).\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written in a way that \\(c\\) is a separate variable, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a very large expression, and the problem is likely expecting a numerical answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all powers of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me try to think differently. Suppose I consider the entire expression as a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and one in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the entire second polynomial. So, that would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is \\(6(c + 1/c)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is typically a number. So, perhaps the problem is miswritten, or I'm misinterpreting it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when all variables are considered, meaning that \\(c\\) is also part of the term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). But the problem didn't specify \\(c\\), so I don't think that's the case.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut then, in the simple example, the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 64 when \\(c = 1\\), which seems inconsistent with the earlier example where the coefficient was \\(c + 1/c\\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a number.\n\nI'm going in circles here. Let me try to make a decision. I think the most reasonable interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut earlier, I thought it was 120 because I was considering only the constant term. So, I'm confused.\n\nWait, let me think about the definition. The coefficient of a term in a product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of the terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. So, in this case, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), we take the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and multiply it by every term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number.\n\nTherefore, the problem is likely expecting the coefficient as a polynomial, but that seems too involved. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient when considering \\(c = 1\\), then it's 384. But since the problem didn't specify \\(c = 1\\), I think the correct answer is that the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial.\n\nBut that seems too complicated, and the problem is likely expecting a numerical answer. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 times the constant term in the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 20, giving 120.\n\nI think that's the most plausible answer. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nWait, the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. Let me write that out. \n\nUsing the binomial theorem, the general term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I want the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would mean \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that. \n\n\\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is just part of the first part of the product. The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm not sure if that affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, maybe the second part doesn't influence the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) directly. \n\nWait, but when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second part, right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, it just adds a factor of that term. But wait, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what happens with \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, no, actually, I think I'm missing something. Let me clarify. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part? But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient is a number, not an expression.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But no, that's not right because when you multiply two expressions, each term is a product of a term from each. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be a number, but when you multiply it by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would make the coefficient a number times \\(a^2b^2\\), but in reality, each term in the product is a combination of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression in \\(c\\).\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by any term from the second expansion. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes its own coefficient, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each of those, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(\\text{Coeff}_{a^2b^2}[(a + b)^4] \\times \\text{Coeff}_{c^0}[(c + 1/c)^6]\\), because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\), the term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but we are only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, but that's not correct because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without considering \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), right? Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) into the expression gives the sum of all coefficients. So, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again. When you have two expressions multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first expression, and in the second expression, any term would be multiplied by it, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. Because each term in the second expression contributes to the coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, maybe the coefficient remains 6, and the rest of the terms involve \\(c\\), which are separate variables. Hmm, that makes more sense. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, regardless of the second part.\n\nWait, but that seems contradictory to what I thought earlier. Let me check with a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1)^3\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in \\((a + b)^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{2}{0} = 1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the product would be 1 times the sum of all coefficients in \\((c + 1)^3\\), which is \\(2^3 = 8\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the product would be 8. So, in that case, the coefficient is affected by the second part.\n\nWait, so in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and then when multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient becomes 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so that's \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in the example I just thought of, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the product was 8, which is correct because \\((a + b)^2(c + 1)^3 = (a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c^3 + 3c^2 + 3c + 1)\\). So, when you multiply, the term \\(a^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product is indeed 1 * (1 + 3 + 3 + 1) = 8. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, applying that logic to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64, so the coefficient in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product being the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\) (which is 1), you get \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion.\n\nSo, let me calculate the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that's different from my earlier conclusion of 384. So, which is correct? Let me see.\n\nIn the example I did earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) was 8, which came from 1 * 8, where 8 was the sum of coefficients in the second expansion. But in that case, I was considering all coefficients, not just the constant term. So, perhaps I was wrong in that example.\n\nWait, in the example, if I have \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1)^3\\), and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\), that term would be \\(a^2\\) times each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 1 * (sum of coefficients in the second expansion), which is 8. But if I were looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0c^0\\), then it would be 1 * 1 (the constant term in the second expansion), which is 1.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the question is just about \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on \\(c\\). So, does that mean we're considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), or just the constant term?\n\nI think the confusion comes from whether the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), or specifically \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). The problem statement says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any mention of \\(c\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, but in the example, if I have \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1)^3\\), and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\), that would be 1 * (sum of coefficients in the second expansion) = 8. But if I'm looking for \\(a^2b^0c^0\\), that would be 1 * 1 = 1.\n\nSo, in the original problem, since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought of it as 6 * 20 = 120, considering only the constant term. So, which interpretation is correct?\n\nI think the key is whether the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), or specifically \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Since the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying \\(c\\), I think it's the former: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean multiplying the coefficient from the first part by the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nBut let me check that with the example again. If I have \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1)^3\\), and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\), that would be 1 * (sum of coefficients in the second expansion) = 8. So, that would mean in the product, the term \\(a^2b^0\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient is indeed 8.\n\nSimilarly, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in that case, the term would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion, and when you sum them up, it's 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit counterintuitive. Let me think about the expansion. When you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each of those terms contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, that would mean the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought of it as 6 * 20 = 120, which would be the case if we were looking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but it's not specified. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384.\n\nBut now I'm confused because in the example, if I have \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1)^3\\), and I look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\), it's 8, which is 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion. So, that seems to support the idea that the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again: in the product, each term is a combination of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nSo, that would mean 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in the earlier calculation where I considered the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), I got 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. So, which is correct?\n\nI think the confusion arises from whether the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), or the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Since the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think it's the former, so the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with another example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 2, so 2. But if I look at the product, it's \\(a(c + 1) + b(c + 1)\\), which expands to \\(ac + a + bc + b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is indeed 2, which comes from 1 (coefficient of \\(a\\) in first part) times 2 (sum of coefficients in second part).\n\nSo, that supports the idea that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which has terms with both positive and negative exponents. So, when we take the sum of all coefficients, we set \\(c = 1\\), giving us \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought of it as 6 * 20 = 120, considering only the constant term. So, which is it?\n\nI think the key is whether the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), or specifically \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Since it just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without mentioning \\(c\\), I think it's the former. So, the answer is 384.\n\nBut now I'm second-guessing because in the problem, the variables are separate, so maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest are separate terms involving \\(c\\). But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but let me think of it differently. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the product is a polynomial in \\(a, b, c, 1/c\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(k\\). So, that would mean summing over all \\(k\\), which is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit odd. I think in standard polynomial multiplication, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term, it's understood that you're considering the term with that exact combination of variables. So, if the problem is asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's the sum of all coefficients where the term is \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). So, that would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should look for a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can treat the two parts separately and then combine them. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, the coefficient remains 6.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times each coefficient from the second part, but when you consider all terms, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as follows: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't possible because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion.\n\nIn that case, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), so the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that makes sense because when you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), you have to consider only the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, which is when \\(k = 3\\), as I calculated earlier. So, the coefficient is 20, and thus 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut then, in the example I did earlier, if I have \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1)^3\\), and I look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0c^0\\), that would be 1 * 1 = 1, because the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 1. But if I look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's 1 * 8 = 8, as before.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120, or the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384. Since the problem statement doesn't specify, it's a bit ambiguous. But given that the problem includes \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), perhaps it's intended to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Let me see if there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, the coefficient remains 6.\n\nBut that seems incorrect because when you multiply, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part, so the coefficient should be affected.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of it as the product being a combination of the two expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120.\n\nSince the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check this with another example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product is 2, which is 1 (from first part) times 2 (sum of coefficients in second part). So, that supports the idea that the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut then, in that case, the term \\(a\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a\\) is indeed 2.\n\nSimilarly, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut then, why did I earlier think of it as 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion? That would be if the problem was asking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which it's not.\n\nWait, perhaps I should clarify: in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in the first part, and when multiplied by any term from the second part, it becomes \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). Therefore, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120.\n\nSince the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so the answer is 384.\n\nBut now I'm really confused because different interpretations lead to different answers. Let me try to see which one makes more sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only considering the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\), so that the term is \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times 20 = 120.\n\nBut the problem statement doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nWait, but to confirm, let me consider the product:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\nand\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\n\\]\n\nSo, when you multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still not sure because in the problem statement, it's possible that they only want the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, making it a term without \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should check both possibilities and see which one makes sense.\n\nIf I consider the problem as asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 384. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120.\n\nGiven that the problem includes both \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), I think it's more likely that they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. So, perhaps that's the intended answer.\n\nWait, but let me think again. In the problem statement, it's written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in the first part, and when multiplied by any term from the second part, it becomes \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). Therefore, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but in that case, the coefficient would be 384, which is a large number, so I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Let me calculate that again.\n\nThe sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum is indeed 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in the example I did earlier, if I have \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1)^3\\), and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\), it's 8, which is 1 times 8, where 8 is the sum of coefficients in the second expansion. So, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I think I'm making a mistake here because in the original problem, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which includes negative exponents. So, when I set \\(c = 1\\), I get the sum of all coefficients, but in reality, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes both positive and negative exponents. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be 6 times 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, after all this thinking, I believe the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but now I'm confused because in the problem statement, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded has terms with both positive and negative exponents. So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all those products, which is 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion, summed up. Therefore, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nYes, I think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   The general term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\).

    "text": " \n\nWait, the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me focus on that part first. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so \\(a^2b^2\\). That means \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does this affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, let me think. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\), the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will only contribute to the coefficient through multiplication. But when we multiply two polynomials, the terms combine by adding their exponents. However, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the exponents won't interfere with each other. That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is being multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. That means we need to consider how \\(a^2b^2\\) is affected by the multiplication. However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. \n\nNo, actually, when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms in each expression that combine to form that specific term. In this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term involving \\(c\\), you'll end up with a term that has \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something like that, but not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nOkay, so now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's apply the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k - k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). \n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(k = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I made any calculation errors here. \n\nJust to be thorough, let me consider the entire expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we only want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we're only interested in the part where the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, i.e., when we multiply by the constant term in the second expansion. So, yeah, that's why we needed the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), and that's 20. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient should be 120. I can't see any mistakes in this reasoning, so I feel confident about this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is given by:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient for this term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is given by:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which corresponds to \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient for this term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each expansion:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is part of the first factor. Does that mean I don't need to worry about the second part? Wait, no, because the entire expression is a product of two parts. So, if I'm looking for a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), that term will come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part and some term in the second part. But since the second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are separate variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as the coefficient in the first part, because when you multiply by the second part, you're just adding more terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\).

But that seems confusing. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nLet me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part and any term in the second part. But since the second part is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), each term in the second part will contribute a coefficient multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But wait, no, because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, which are terms like \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will just add another factor, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), perhaps we need to consider that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, that might make sense. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you're effectively scaling \\(a^2b^2\\) by each coefficient in the second expansion. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Let me test it. Let's say the second expansion has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the sum of the coefficients would be when we set \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear in the product as \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each of these terms, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm wrong because the problem might just be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since each term in the second part has a coefficient, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The first part gives me terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part gives me terms involving \\(c\\). So, when I multiply them, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), so in that case, it would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the other variables. So, since the other part is multiplied by any term, the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion's coefficients, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check. Let's take a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\). So, the product would be \\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be 1 times (1 + 1) = 2, because \\(a^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), each with coefficient 1. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2 times (1 + 1) = 4, and the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) would be 1 times (1 + 1) = 2. So, in this case, the coefficients of \\(a^2\\), \\(ab\\), and \\(b^2\\) are each multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 2.\n\nSo, applying that to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64, so the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. Let's compute \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of its coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), which is correct. So, yes, the sum is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of \\(c\\). So, if I consider the entire product, each term in the product will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or something like that, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from \\(k=2\\) in the first expansion, and any \\(m\\) from the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the rest can be anything, so it's 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with another approach. Let's think of the entire product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and any term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Since the second part's sum of coefficients is 64, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me think about the entire expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present in the product, and its coefficient will be 6 multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^6\\) would have coefficient 6 * 1 = 6, the term \\(a^2b^2 \\times 6c^4\\) would have coefficient 6 * 6 = 36, and so on. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\) would be 6*(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6*64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me compute the sum inside again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{0} = 1\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{1} = 6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{2} = 15\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), and then it decreases: 15, 6, 1. So, the sum of the coefficients is indeed 1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute it step by step.\n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\):\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nNow, expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\):\n\nUsing the binomial theorem:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficients are:\n\n- For \\(k=0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0} = 1\\), term is \\(c^6\\)\n- \\(k=1\\): 6, term is \\(6c^4\\)\n- \\(k=2\\): 15, term is \\(15c^2\\)\n- \\(k=3\\): 20, term is \\(20c^0 = 20\\)\n- \\(k=4\\): 15, term is \\(15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(k=5\\): 6, term is \\(6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(k=6\\): 1, term is \\(c^{-6}\\)\n\nThe sum of these coefficients is 1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64.\n\nTherefore, when we multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nSo, I think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion has the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

    "text": " \n\nLet me focus on the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, the terms would be from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(k = 4\\). The coefficients would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{1}\\), up to \\(\\dbinom{4}{4}\\). \n\nNow, I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need the term where the exponent of \\(a\\) is 2 and the exponent of \\(b\\) is 2. So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), that would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) because \\(4 - k = 2\\) implies \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). \n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), that's \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider the entire expression, not just \\((a + b)^4\\). Hmm, so maybe I need to multiply the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). Let me think. If I multiply the two expansions together, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. \n\nBut since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and doesn't involve \\(c\\), then when I multiply by the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. \n\nBut wait, if I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut that seems a bit confusing. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps the coefficient is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a single number, not an expression involving \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some terms involving \\(c\\), but the coefficient is the numerical factor in front of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a constant, not a polynomial in \\(c\\). \n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the question. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all terms, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) could be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient is just the numerical factor. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then depend on the \\(c\\) terms. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient is usually a scalar, not a polynomial. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. \n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me check that. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\), which is correct. So, the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, when I multiply by 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, is that correct? Let me think differently. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion has a coefficient of 6, and it's being multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Since the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, then 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if I consider the entire expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that seems to contradict the idea that the coefficient should be a single number. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, in that case, I would need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term, and then multiply it by 6. \n\nThat makes more sense. So, perhaps I should find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6 to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. \n\nOkay, so let's try that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be done using the binomial theorem as well. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). \n\nTherefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 * 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but that was when considering the sum of all coefficients, which would be if we were looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a scalar. \n\nBut if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 120. Alternatively, if we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 times the entire expansion, which would be a polynomial, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a single number. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nWait, but let me confirm. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's possible that they're considering the entire expression and just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a scalar, so that can't be right. \n\nTherefore, the correct interpretation must be that they're asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me think about the expansion. When you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) for each \\(k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is ambiguous. It could mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), or it could mean the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for all \\(k\\). \n\nIf it's the former, then the answer is 120. If it's the latter, then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut since the problem is written as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\), it's ambiguous. However, in typical problems like this, when a term involving multiple variables is asked for, it's usually referring to the term where all variables are present with the specified exponents, but in this case, \\(c\\) is separate. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written in such a way that \\(c\\) is another variable, and the coefficient is being asked for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). So, in that case, it's 6 times the entire expansion, which would be a polynomial. But since the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a scalar, I think the intended interpretation is that \\(c\\) must be raised to the zero power, so the answer is 120. \n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 (c + 1/c)^6\\), and I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would be the sum of all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a single number. \n\nTherefore, I think the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written in such a way that \\(c\\) is another variable, and we're supposed to treat \\(a^2b^2\\) as a separate term, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion, but that seems unlikely because the coefficient is usually a scalar. \n\nWait, perhaps I can check by expanding a simpler version. Let's say I have \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion would be \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be 1 * (c + 1/c), which is a polynomial, but that's not a scalar. So, perhaps in that case, the problem would be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2c^0\\), which would be 1 * 1 = 1. \n\nSimilarly, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 120. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but that was when considering the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But that would be if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), which is not the case here. \n\nSo, to summarize, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is 120. \n\nWait, but let me confirm one more time. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a^2b^2. Then, when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by 6a^2b^2. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. \n\nTherefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nYes, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   We need to find the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) in this expansion to pair it with the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.\n\n3. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the constant term is 20.\n\n4. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each expansion:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"

    "text": " Let me write that down for \\((a + b)^4\\).\n\nSo, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), each term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, right? Because the problem asks for \\(a^2b^2\\). So, if \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\) is \\(a^2b^2\\), then \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for that term should be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) part is 6.\n\nNow, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, I also need to expand this using the binomial theorem. So, that would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Let me simplify that term inside the sum: \\(c^{6 - m} \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^m} = c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean I need to consider the entire expression multiplied together? So, \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But in this product, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are only in the second part. So, when I multiply them, the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) will be multiplied together.\n\nBut wait, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all. So, does that mean that when I multiply the two expansions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion? But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because then the coefficient would be a sum, not a single number.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because otherwise, \\(a^2b^2\\) could be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), but since the problem just mentions \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe it's considering the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, in the product, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\) would be \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that the exponent of \\(c\\) should be zero. So, we need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which would mean \\(m = 3\\). So, the term in the second expansion where \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20 \\times 1 = 20\\). So, the coefficient from the second part is 20.\n\nTherefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the product of the coefficients from both parts, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiplying them together gives 120. That seems right. Alternatively, if I were to consider all the terms, but since the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), but that doesn't make sense because the variables are separate. So, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), but the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\)'s exponent, but that doesn't seem likely. Alternatively, maybe the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), but that would require summing over all possible \\(c\\) exponents, which isn't straightforward.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear in the product as \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\) for each \\(m\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But wait, that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the sum of all coefficients in a binomial expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 would be 384. But that seems too large, and also, I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient when considering the entire term, including the \\(c\\) part. So, perhaps I was correct the first time, that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's the sum of all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, as I thought earlier, which is 384. But that seems too big, and I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient when the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, making it a term independent of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the answer is 120.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, the way it's phrased, it's in the entire expression. So, if I'm looking for the term where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\), but the expression also includes \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) could be multiplied by \\(c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). But unless specified, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't a variable in the second expression, so perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient when multiplied by \\(c^0\\), making it a standalone \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a polynomial in multiple variables and wants the coefficient of the monomial \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) part. But that would require considering the entire sum, which is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems too high, and I think the problem is more likely expecting the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 6 times 20, giving 120.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as a product of two polynomials. The first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables are separate. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first polynomial, and it's multiplied by every term from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a constant. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire product, but only for the term where \\(c\\) is raised to zero. So, that would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, giving 120.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. So, the answer would be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nLet me just verify that by considering the expansions. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives a term \\(20c^0\\). So, when you multiply these, you get \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2c^0 = 120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to compute the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion, but only the term where \\(c^0\\) would give a standalone \\(a^2b^2\\) term. All other terms would have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), which wouldn't be just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the problem is likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nI think that's it. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient here is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   We look for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\) gives \\(m = 3\\). The term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient here is 20.\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients:**\n   Multiply the coefficients from both expansions to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me think about that part first.\n\nSo, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the general term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\), where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would mean \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, substituting \\(k = 2\\), the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, I think it does because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to consider the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in those terms. Let me think about that more carefully.\n\nWait, actually, no. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term from the first expansion gets multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part, because any term in the second expansion would only affect the \\(c\\) terms, not the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) remains 6? Or is there something else I'm missing?\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to approach it differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\((a^kb^{4 - k}) \\times (c^m \\times \\dfrac{1}{c}^{6 - m})\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can ignore the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is a separate expansion. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all terms in the second expansion, but that can't be right because that would make the coefficient very large, but I think that's not correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which includes the \\(c\\) terms as well. But \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply by the second part, each term in the first part gets multiplied by each term in the second part. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a single term, it would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that's not correct because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient remains 6 because the \\(c\\) terms are separate variables. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should treat the two parts separately. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Then, the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), is a separate expansion, and when I multiply the two expressions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that seems incorrect because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, but the variables are different, so \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a numerical value, not an expression involving \\(c\\).\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which would be 6 times \\(2^6\\) because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has coefficients that are binomial coefficients, and the sum of the coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 would be 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it again. Let me try a different approach. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of those involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that's not correct because the second part is a separate expansion, and when you multiply by it, you're essentially scaling each term in the first part by each term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes a term like \\(6 \\times \\text{(coefficient from second part)} \\times a^2b^2c^k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's actually the sum of all coefficients from the second part multiplied by 6.\n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem might be interpreted differently.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first expansion, and it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (the coefficient from the first part) multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion, you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant, which is the term we're interested in. So, maybe I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nOkay, that makes more sense. So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let's find that. The general term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that seems more reasonable. So, the coefficient is 120. Let me double-check that. In the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when you multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, resulting in a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense because any other terms from the second expansion would involve positive or negative exponents of \\(c\\), which would not be part of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term we're interested in. So, the only contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

But wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire product.\n\nHmm, so I think I need to expand both parts separately and then multiply them together, but maybe there's a smarter way. Since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps I don't need to expand the entire \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part. Let me think about how the multiplication works.\n\nWhen I multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) has terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), etc., and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will have terms involving powers of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I can focus on the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts.\n\nWait, that might not make sense. Let me clarify. The \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are separate from the \\(c\\) terms, so when I multiply, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts only come from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the \\(c\\) parts come from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product will come from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but that doesn't sound right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. So, actually, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product will be \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think again. If I have \\( (a + b)^4 = 6a^2b^2 + \\text{other terms} \\) and \\( \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\text{some terms} \\), then when I multiply them, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will indeed be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will be multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(6a^2b^2 \\times c^{-k}\\), but the coefficient for each \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) term would be 6 times the coefficient from the other expansion.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut wait, that doesn't seem right because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has its own coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), it becomes part of the product. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), each of those will be separate terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that multiplies the 6, resulting in terms like \\(6 \\times \\text{coefficient} \\times a^2b^2c^k\\).\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, all the terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) will have coefficients that are 6 times the corresponding coefficients from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but that might not be the case. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first polynomial, and \\(c\\) is only in the second, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product will only come from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), setting \\(c = 1\\) gives the sum of all coefficients. Let me compute that.\n\nSo, \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me check if I'm interpreting the problem correctly. The problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. But in the product, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or something like that, where \\(k\\) is from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) depends on the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Because in the product, each term from the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so each term will have a coefficient that's 6 times the coefficient from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think differently. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, yes, that would be 6 * \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, not the entire expression. So, if we consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) being 6, and then multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check this with a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the first part is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is (1 + 1) = 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Let's see: \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c) = c + 1/c\\). Multiplying them: \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) is 1 * (c + 1/c), but in terms of coefficients, it's 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 2. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, applying the same logic, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and \\(c^k\\) in the second polynomial. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we're essentially summing over all possible \\(k\\), which means we're summing the coefficients of all terms in the second polynomial, which is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if we were to write out the entire product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would result in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in this context, I think they mean the coefficient regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misinterpreting the question. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. That would make more sense if the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient without any \\(c\\) terms. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, as each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that, when multiplied by 6, gives the coefficient for the corresponding \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) term. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, another thought: Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) sum to zero. That would make sense if the problem expects a specific term. Let me check that possibility.\n\nIf that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. To do this, I would need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term, and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part.\n\nSo, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so:\n\n\\(6 - 2k = 0\\)\n\nSolving for \\(k\\):\n\n\\(2k = 6\\)\n\n\\(k = 3\\)\n\nSo, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, so now I'm confused. Earlier, I thought the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384, but if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120.\n\nLooking back at the problem statement: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" The way it's phrased, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term from the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by 6, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nHowever, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 * 20 = 120. But as it's written, I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so the answer would be 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. In the context of such problems, when they ask for the coefficient of a term that doesn't involve another variable, they usually mean the sum of all coefficients for that term across all possible powers of the other variables. So, for example, if you have \\( (a + b)(c + 1/c) \\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 2, so the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be 2.\n\nSimilarly, in this problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut I'm a bit unsure because sometimes problems specify the term, including all variables, but in this case, it's only specifying \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to be safe, maybe I should consider both interpretations.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" The way it's phrased, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's ambiguous whether they want the coefficient multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), or just the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). But in algebra, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term that doesn't include another variable, it's usually interpreted as the coefficient of that term regardless of the other variables. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if they had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would be 120. But since they didn't specify \\(c\\), it's more likely they want 384.\n\nWait, but let me think of it another way. If I expand the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present in all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of the coefficients of all terms \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any integer \\(k\\). Therefore, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me compute the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As I did earlier, setting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit unsure because sometimes problems expect you to consider only the term where the exponents of all variables are zero, but in this case, it's not clear. However, given the problem statement, I think the correct interpretation is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 384.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{384}\n\\]"

    "text": " Let me write it down.\n\nFirst, let me consider the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this would expand to \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, the terms would be:\n\n- When \\(k = 0\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 = 1 \\cdot a^4 = a^4\\)\n- When \\(k = 1\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 = 4a^3b\\)\n- When \\(k = 2\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\)\n- When \\(k = 3\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 = 4ab^3\\)\n- When \\(k = 4\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4 = 1 \\cdot b^4 = b^4\\)\n\nSo, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). Now, I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient in the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I can't just stop here; I need to consider the entire product.\n\nLet me think. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply these two expressions together, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to figure out which terms in the second expansion will affect this coefficient.\n\nWait, but actually, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so when I multiply the two expressions, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), any terms in the second expansion will just be coefficients multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad because the second expansion has many terms, but perhaps since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two expressions, each term is multiplied by each term, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the product would just have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term of the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second expansion would contribute its coefficient times \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but that might not be correct. Let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, the first polynomial has terms with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), while the second has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiply it by any term from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part because each term in the second expansion will just add another factor, but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), all the terms in the second expansion will contribute their coefficients multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut wait, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check if I'm not making a mistake here. So, the idea is that since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term in the second polynomial will just multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a coefficient, and the total contribution to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial. So, yes, that makes sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first will be multiplied by every term in the second, effectively adding up all the coefficients of the second polynomial.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the entire second expression is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so when multiplied, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will have a coefficient that is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Since the sum of coefficients is 64, the total coefficient is 6*64=384.\n\nBut let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Another approach is to consider that the entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, which is 6a^2b^2, and when multiplied by any term from the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which expands to terms like \\(c^6, 6c^4, 15c^2, 20, 15/c^2, 6/c^4, 1/c^6\\). So, each of these terms will be multiplied by 6a^2b^2, resulting in terms like 6a^2b^2c^6, 36a^2b^2c^4, etc. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by 6. So, yes, that would be 6*(sum of coefficients in second polynomial). As I calculated earlier, the sum is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire product as a product of two polynomials, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first times the sum of all coefficients in the second. So, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not confusing anything here. Another way to approach this is to recognize that since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), leading to terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^4\\), etc. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the total coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial times the coefficient from the first.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as evaluating the entire expression at specific values. For example, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can set \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), and \\(c = 1\\), but that might not directly help. Wait, no, perhaps using generating functions or something else. But I think my initial approach is correct.\n\nWait, but let me try another way. Let's consider the entire product: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can treat \\(c\\) as a separate variable. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion will just multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. As before, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but maybe I should double-check by actually expanding the second polynomial and seeing what the sum of coefficients is. Let me try that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is given by the binomial theorem as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the terms are:\n\n- \\(k=0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1 \\cdot c^6\\)\n- \\(k=1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^4 = 6c^4\\)\n- \\(k=2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^2 = 15c^2\\)\n- \\(k=3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\\)\n- \\(k=4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(k=5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(k=6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). The sum of all coefficients is when \\(c=1\\), which gives \\(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64\\), as I thought earlier.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing any subtlety. Is there a possibility that some terms in the second expansion could affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in a different way? For example, if there were terms that could combine with \\(a^2b^2\\) to form another term that's also \\(a^2b^2\\), but that doesn't make sense because \\(c\\) is a separate variable. So, each term in the second expansion is a multiple of \\(c\\) raised to some power, which doesn't interfere with the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term in the second expansion, you just get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that term, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the total coefficient is just the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiply it by any term from the second polynomial, which has no \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me consider a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Let's compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\), which is the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 1. The second polynomial is \\(c + 1/c\\), whose sum of coefficients is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product should be 1 * 2 = 2. Let's verify by expanding:\n\n\\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c) = (a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The \\(a^2\\) term would be \\(a^2c + a^2/c\\), so the coefficients are \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but if we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then it's the sum of the coefficients from the second polynomial times 1, which is 2. So, that works.\n\nSimilarly, if I take \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is 2, so the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product is 1 * 2 = 2. Indeed, expanding gives \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\), and the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), whose sum is 2.\n\nSo, applying the same logic, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, I think I can confidently say that the coefficient is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem and properties of polynomial multiplication.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   Thus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

So, maybe the term \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is just a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it will just scale the coefficient by whatever that expression evaluates to. But wait, that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests that \\(c\\) might be involved in a way that affects the coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, actually, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when expanding, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other part is in \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that seems odd because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, so maybe I need to consider the entire expression as a product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any terms in \\(c\\). Wait, but I think the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so perhaps the coefficient will be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that can't be right because the coefficient is a number, not a polynomial. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)?\" So, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. So, in other words, when you expand the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient that is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for that coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that seems too simple. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is a product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all possible terms from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the variables are separate.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually a product of two expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, maybe the problem is written incorrectly, and it's actually \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^{10}\\) or something else. But no, the problem is as stated.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's a bit odd. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part is just a multiplier, so the overall coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a function of \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and it's multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), because substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives the sum of coefficients. So, \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Hmm, that seems plausible.\n\nWait, let me check that again. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then that term would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a bit ambiguous because \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which suggests it's a number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, but that doesn't make sense because \\(c\\) isn't part of \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is a typo, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^{10}\\) or something else.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then since \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a separate factor, the overall coefficient would be 6 times whatever \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) evaluates to, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient is a number, not a function of \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, so that the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That would make more sense because then the coefficient would be a number.\n\nSo, if that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that is multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, first, I can find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, let's compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, so 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)), which gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiplying them gives 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering the \\(c\\) terms, is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, a number. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let me consider the entire expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and it's multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient that is 6 times each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's actually a polynomial in \\(c\\). But if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 120. Let me just recap:\n\n1. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\): which is 6.\n2. Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\): which is 20.\n3. Multiply them together: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the final coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by expanding \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion will be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that mean I need to consider the expansion of that part as well? Hmm, I think so. Because the entire expression is a product of two binomials raised to powers, so when you multiply them, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. \n\nBut hold on, the question is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), so maybe the part with \\(c\\) doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. If I'm looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by some term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), does that mean we just need the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\n\nWait, no, actually, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) because \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) would just be \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the coefficient where the powers of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively.\n\nSo, let me approach this differently. Let's consider the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and expand it. Each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, it becomes \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, I need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so that means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as I found earlier. So, from the first part, we have \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for the second part, we have \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). Since we want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 (because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\)), we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving that, \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient from the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient from the second part is 20. \n\nNow, to get the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), we multiply the coefficients from both parts: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives a coefficient of 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives a coefficient of 20 for \\(c^0\\). When we multiply these together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by \\(c^0\\) from the second part, resulting in \\(a^2b^2\\), and the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nIs there any other term that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second part, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and the constant term from the second expansion. So, I think that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), we just need the constant term from the second expansion. \n\nSo, yeah, I think 120 is the correct coefficient. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). We need the constant term (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0). Using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nThe constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, we multiply the coefficients from both expansions:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

I wonder if this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).

But that seems odd because the second part is raised to the 6th power, so it must contribute something. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the expression is the product of two binomial expansions. So, when you multiply them together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, we need to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second part. Because if you take any term from the second part that has a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), then the product will have a \\(c\\) term, which isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think that's the key here. \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense because when you multiply the two expansions, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and the constant term from the second part.\n\nSo, I already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to do that. Again, I can use the binomial theorem for this. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nI need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) and solve for \\(k\\). That gives \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720/(6*6) is 720/36, which is 20. Yes, that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of 6 and 20, which is 120. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), which gives us \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, multiplying 6 by 20 gives 120. That seems right. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficients multiply. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first part and the constant term is in the second part, their product gives the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6*20=120.

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to expand this as well. Using the binomial theorem again, this would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which involves only \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and not \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the terms involving \\(c\\) will multiply with the terms from \\((a + b)^4\\), but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe we can ignore the \\(c\\) part? Or perhaps the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't seem right because each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would multiply each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\).\n\nWait, no, actually, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), maybe I can treat the two parts separately. That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and then I need to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when I multiply, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I only care about \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. But wait, that might not be correct because the sum of all coefficients in the second expression would be when we set \\(c = 1\\), right? So, substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expression is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check if that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then yes, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and since every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by the terms from \\((a + b)^4\\), the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, which is 64, giving 384. But wait, let me make sure that's the case. Let me think about how the multiplication works.\n\nWhen you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients from each polynomial that combine to form that term. But in this case, since the first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\) would be 6 times each coefficient in the second expression. But since we're only asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) term, we just need to sum all those possibilities, which is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. And since the sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives 64, then 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, that term would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, which is indeed 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about it differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. As we determined earlier, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\) and the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I'm not missing something. Is there a possibility that the second expansion could affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? For example, if the second expansion had a term with \\(c^0\\), which is 1, then that term would just multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) directly. But in reality, the second expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but when we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we need to sum all the coefficients from the second expansion because each term in the second expansion will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\), contributing to the total coefficient. So, yes, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me verify this by another approach. Let me compute the entire product and see if the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 384. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it term by term.\n\nFirst, let's expand \\((a + b)^4\\). As before, the expansion is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nNext, let's expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, this is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, the terms are:\n\n- \\(m = 0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^{6} = 1 \\times c^6\\)\n- \\(m = 1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^{4} = 6c^4\\)\n- \\(m = 2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^{2} = 15c^2\\)\n- \\(m = 3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20 \\times 1 = 20\\)\n- \\(m = 4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(m = 5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(m = 6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the expansion of the second part is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply this by \\((a + b)^4\\), each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, giving terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 6c^4 = 36a^2b^2c^4\\), and so on, up to \\(6a^2b^2 \\times c^{-6}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, all these terms will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can sum all the coefficients from the second expansion and multiply by 6.\n\nAs we saw earlier, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the sum of coefficients is 64, as calculated, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, then 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to compute the entire expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times each term in the second expansion, but since we're summing over all terms, it's 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct by considering a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we have \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second expression, which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), so 1 * 2 = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) would be 1 times 2 = 2. But if I expand it, it's \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). So, the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are each 2, which matches our calculation. So, in that case, the method works. Therefore, applying the same logic, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that each term in the product is a combination of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum over all terms where the power of \\(a\\) is 2 and the power of \\(b\\) is 2, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think the answer is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\) and \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). So, \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I need to consider the expansion of this as well. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so does that mean I just need to consider the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part? But that doesn't seem right because the second part might have terms that could affect the coefficient. Wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term independent of \\(c\\), so when I multiply it by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), it would just be 6 times each term in that expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a^2b^2\\) is already present in the first part, I think the second part's expansion doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe the coefficient remains 6 regardless of the second part. Hmm, but that seems too straightforward.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, actually, the entire expression is the product of two expansions. So, when we multiply them together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), right? Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), it would become \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something, which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is if we take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by the constant term (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) from the second part.\n\nSo, that means I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me work on that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the constant term from the second part. So, that's \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. When we multiply these two together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about the entire expansion. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when expanded, it's the product of two polynomials. Each term in the first polynomial is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\) and each term in the second is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when we multiply them, each term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nNow, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the first polynomial, that occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as I thought earlier. So, \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). \n\nNow, since we're looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to multiply it by the term in the second polynomial that has \\(c^0\\), which we found to be when \\(m = 3\\), giving a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the overall coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I should consider if there are other terms in the second polynomial that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by other terms from the first polynomial. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), any term from the second polynomial that has a non-zero power of \\(c\\) would result in a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the constant term from the second polynomial contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. \n\nTherefore, I think my conclusion is correct. The coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\).

But since we're only asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are not present in the second expansion, the coefficient should remain the same as in the first expansion.

But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only be affected if there were other terms in the second expansion that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\), but since there aren't any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) in the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first expansion. So, I think I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\).\n\nLet me calculate that. Using the binomial theorem, \\((a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs is when \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\).

So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second expansion doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the same as in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me clarify.\n\nActually, when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms from each expression that multiply together to give that specific term. In this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the first expression because the second expression doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first expression times the entire second expression. But that can't be right because the second expression is a sum of terms, so the coefficient would actually be the coefficient from the first expression multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from the second expression, but that doesn't make sense either.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is simply \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second expansion is a constant (with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)) that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut wait, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems plausible, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me verify.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part, because when you multiply by the second part, it's like multiplying by a constant (with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)), so the coefficient remains the same. But that contradicts my earlier thought. Hmm.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you expand the entire product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part contributes a factor that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the total coefficient is 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second expansion). And as I calculated before, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first expansion times the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), but when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and when you expand this, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present only from the first part, and it's multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, let me check this another way. Let's say I expand both parts separately. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), gives \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), expands to a sum of terms involving various powers of \\(c\\). When I multiply these two expansions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it just becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient. So, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nThe sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and since the second part is multiplied by it, the coefficient is just the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion. But since the second expansion is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is a sum of terms, not a single coefficient. So, perhaps I'm wrong.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the entire second expansion, each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{-k}\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, because the second part doesn't contribute any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient remains 6. But that contradicts my earlier thought.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because when you multiply by the second expansion, which has multiple terms, each term in the product will be a combination of terms from both expansions. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient is 6, because the second expansion doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that seems conflicting.\n\nWait, let me think of a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion is \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, but in this case, the second expansion is linear in \\(c\\), so when you multiply, the highest degree in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is 2, so \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present. Hmm, but in our original problem, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\), which does have \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is multiplied by it. So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, does that mean we're considering \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\)? Or are we supposed to consider \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\)?\n\nWait, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear with various powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that multiplies \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then it would be different, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but let me check this with another example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The product is \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion, which is 1 (from \\(c\\)) + 1 (from \\(1/c\\)) = 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product is 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) is also 2. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is indeed the coefficient from the first part (which is 1) multiplied by the sum of coefficients from the second part (which is 2). So, 1 * 2 = 2.\n\nSimilarly, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of coefficients from the second part (which is 64). So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " Let me write down the expansion for \\((a + b)^4\\).\n\nExpanding \\((a + b)^4\\), using the binomial theorem, would give me terms like \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\), and so on, up to \\(\\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Since I'm interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I should look at the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\). Let me compute \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). I remember that \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} = \\dfrac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\\), so plugging in the numbers, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nWait, but the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider both parts of this product. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire expression, which also includes the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part. Hmm, does that mean I need to consider terms from both expansions that multiply together to give an \\(a^2b^2\\) term? Or is it just the coefficient from the first part, since the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables?\n\nLet me think. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), right? So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), any term in the product will be a combination of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), because when you multiply by terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), those terms will have factors of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. \n\nWait, but is that correct? Let me verify. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I expand this product, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), it will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a scalar (it doesn't involve \\(c\\)), each of those products will be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some term involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Therefore, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is just adding another factor, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present once, without any \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be 6, right?\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. If I have two separate parts multiplied together, the coefficients from each part don't interfere unless you're combining like terms. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first part, and the second part is about \\(c\\). So, when you multiply, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but those terms are all involving \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually appear as \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{(something with }c\\text{)}\\). Therefore, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that doesn't make sense because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), but \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a single term. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high, and I'm not sure if that's correct.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me approach it differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(c^0\\) would mean the term without any \\(c\\), so that when you multiply, you just get \\(a^2b^2\\) times 1. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because that's the only term that won't introduce any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply, you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient. So, now I need to compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\) in the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from the second part with coefficient 20. So, when you multiply these two parts, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but only the term with \\(c^0\\) will give a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms would have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so they wouldn't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused now because earlier I thought maybe the coefficient would just be 6, but then I realized that I need to consider the coefficient from the second expansion as well. So, let me think again: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of coefficients from each polynomial that combine to form that term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second polynomial. So, that's why the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two expansions. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) is being multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from the second part. So, when you multiply these together, you get \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0 = a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct by considering a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Let's compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but in \\((a + b)^2\\), the term \\(a^2b^0\\) has coefficient 1, and \\(a^1b^1\\) has coefficient 2, and \\(a^0b^2\\) has coefficient 1. In \\((c + 1/c)^1\\), the expansion is \\(c + 1/c\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in \\((a + b)^2\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\((c + 1/c)\\). But wait, \\((c + 1/c)\\) doesn't have a \\(c^0\\) term, so the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 0. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 1 * 0 = 0, which makes sense because when you expand, there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term without \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\).\n\nSimilarly, if I take \\((a + b)^3 \\times (c + 1/c)^3\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^1\\) in \\((a + b)^3\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\((c + 1/c)^3\\). Wait, no, actually, in \\((a + b)^3\\), the term \\(a^2b^1\\) has coefficient 3, and in \\((c + 1/c)^3\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{3}{1.5}\\), but wait, that's not an integer. Wait, no, let me compute it properly. The expansion of \\((c + 1/c)^3\\) is \\(c^3 + 3c + 3/c + 1/c^3\\). So, there's no \\(c^0\\) term here. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 0. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 3 * 0 = 0, which again makes sense because there's no \\(c^0\\) term to multiply with \\(a^2b^1\\). Wait, but I'm looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which in \\((a + b)^3\\) would require \\(k=2\\), so the term is \\(\\dbinom{3}{2}a^1b^2\\), which is 3a^1b^2. Wait, no, that's not \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, in \\((a + b)^3\\), there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term because the exponents can only add up to 3, and \\(2 + 2 = 4\\), which is higher than 3. So, maybe that's a bad example.\n\nLet me try another example. Let's say I have \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\((c + 1/c)^2\\). Expanding \\((c + 1/c)^2\\) gives \\(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 2. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 2 = 12. Let me check by expanding:\n\n\\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\n\\((c + 1/c)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\).\n\nMultiplying these together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would come from 6a^2b^2 times 2, giving 12a^2b^2. So, yes, that works. Therefore, my approach seems correct.\n\nSo, applying that to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 (from the first part) times 20 (from the second part), which is 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). I used the binomial theorem and found that when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), \\(k = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\cdot c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent is \\(6 - 2k\\), and we set that equal to 0 to find \\(k = 3\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\\). So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think about another way. Suppose I consider the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can treat \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) as separate variables, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to have the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed the product of the two coefficients, which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\n3. **Combining the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."
