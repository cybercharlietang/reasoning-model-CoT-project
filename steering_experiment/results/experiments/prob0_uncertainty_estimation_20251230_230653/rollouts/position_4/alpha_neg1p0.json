    "text": " \n\nAlright, so for the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), I can expand that as \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). That simplifies to \\(1 \\cdot a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) here is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider both expansions. Let me write that out: \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply the two expansions together, the terms will combine, and the only way to get an \\(a^2b^2\\) term is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by a term that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), which would be \\(c^0\\), since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't interact with \\(a\\) or \\(b\\).\n\nSo, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to do that. Again, I can use the binomial theorem for this expansion. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nI want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so I set up the equation \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), I get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). That would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives me 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives me 20 for \\(c^0\\). Since these are multiplied together, the coefficients multiply as well, so 6 times 20 is indeed 120. \n\nIs there another way to think about this? Maybe considering the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions and focusing on the terms that contribute to \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). That seems consistent with what I did earlier. \n\nAlternatively, I could think of the entire expression as a product and consider all possible combinations, but that might be more complicated. I think the method I used is straightforward: find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, then multiply them together since the variables are independent. \n\nJust to be thorough, let me compute \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) again. \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is calculated as \\(6! / (3! \\cdot (6 - 3)!)\\), which is \\(720 / (6 \\cdot 6) = 720 / 36 = 20\\). Yep, that's correct. And \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is \\(6\\), which I also confirmed earlier. So, 6 times 20 is 120. \n\nI don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, the coefficient should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by expanding each part separately and then multiplying the relevant coefficients. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\). This is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiply these coefficients: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so let's look at the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this would expand to \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). So, the terms are \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the expansion of that part as well. Maybe I should handle each part separately and then see how they multiply together. \n\nLet me think. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to consider all the terms, just the ones that contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. However, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the variables in each part don't interfere with each other. That is, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are independent of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, is that right? Let me check. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then each term in the first expansion is a term like \\(a^kb^{4 - k}\\) and each term in the second expansion is a term like \\(c^m (1/c)^{6 - m}\\) which simplifies to \\(c^{m - (6 - m)} = c^{2m - 6}\\). \n\nSo, when you multiply these together, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part, but since the variables are different, the exponents don't interfere. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, actually, maybe I need to consider the product of the two expansions and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. \n\nBut how does that work? Because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you're essentially creating a product where each term is a combination of an \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) term and a \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) term. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but I don't think that's the case. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that might not be correct either. Let me think again. When you have two separate variables, the coefficient of a specific term in one variable part is multiplied by the entire expansion of the other variable part. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6 in \\((a + b)^4\\), then in the product with \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), this coefficient would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me reread the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. In other words, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing to the overall coefficient. \n\nBut wait, that might not be right. Let me think differently. Suppose I consider the entire expression as a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and one in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When you multiply them, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) by the constant term (if any) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if you multiply by any other term, it would introduce \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) into the term, making it \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something, which is not just \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, that makes sense. So, to get the term \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part by the constant term (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I know is 6 from the binomial expansion. \n\nNext, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do this, I can use the binomial theorem again. Let me write out the expansion: \n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\) so \\(k = 3\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. \n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 and 20. \n\nSo, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120. \n\nWait, let me double-check that. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term (which is 6) by the constant term in the second expansion (which is 20). So, 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nIs there another way to think about this? Let me consider the entire product. When you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will only contribute to the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product if it's multiplied by the constant term from the second part. All other multiplications would result in terms that have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which we don't want. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. Correct. \n\nFor \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\cdot \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when does the exponent equal zero? When \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Then, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Correct. \n\nSo, multiplying these together, 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. \n\nI don't think I missed anything here. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for each part separately.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the coefficient of the constant term \\(c^0\\). Setting the exponent equal to zero, we solve \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) to find \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which means \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let me set \\(4 - k = 2\\) because the exponent of \\(a\\) is 2.

I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Wait, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) is in the second part, does that mean the \\(a^2b^2\\) term doesn't involve \\(c\\)? So, when I multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. \n\nWait, is that right? Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand this, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think I just need the coefficient from the first part. Because when you multiply by the second expansion, which involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), those terms will just add more variables, but the \\(a^2b^2\\) term's coefficient remains the same. \n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the way it's written, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps I just need the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and then the second part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by all the \\(c\\) terms, but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient remains 6. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider the entire expansion, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the same as the coefficient in the first part, which is 6, because when you multiply by the second part, which is a series in \\(c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will have coefficients multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's just the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is separate. \n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it differently. Let me denote the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all the coefficients from the second part. \n\nWait, but that might not be correct because the second part has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but that seems too high. Let me check again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then when I multiply, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part. \n\nBut wait, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is indeed \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because the second part has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, yes, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But when you multiply a term by an entire expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which means that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term from the second expansion, but since the problem doesn't specify any \\(c\\) terms, it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion. So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have multiple variables, the coefficient is only for the specific term, but in this case, since \\(c\\) is separate, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut let me check this another way. Let's compute the entire expansion step by step. \n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is as we found, with coefficient 6. \n\nNow, expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nSo, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k\\) from 0 to 6. \n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) (which has coefficient 6) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\) will be 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\). \n\nBut since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum all the coefficients where the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents are 2, which means we sum 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for all \\(k\\) from 0 to 6. \n\nSo, the total coefficient is 6 * sum_{k=0}^{6} \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\). \n\nBut the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) from k=0 to 6 is \\(2^6 = 64\\). \n\nTherefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had specified a particular power of \\(c\\), say \\(c^0\\), then we would have to find the term where \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k=3\\), and then the coefficient would be 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) = 6 * 20 = 120. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's 384. \n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when you have multiple variables, the coefficient is considered only for the specific monomial, but in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 384. \n\nLet me confirm this by considering a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The term \\(ab\\) would have coefficient 1 * (sum of coefficients in the second part), which is 1*(1 + 1) = 2. But in reality, when you expand, the terms are \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 2, which is 1 * 2. So, in this case, it works out. Similarly, if I take \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{2}{2}\\) times sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 1 * 4 = 4.

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so let's start with \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this should expand to \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, right? Because the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I guess I need to find the value of \\(k\\) such that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me check: if \\(k = 2\\), then \\(4 - 2 = 2\\), so that's correct. \n\nSo, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nNow, wait, but the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how that affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, the coefficients multiply if the variables are independent. But in this case, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so maybe the coefficients are independent. \n\nWait, let me think again. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I expand both parts, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all different variables, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if it comes from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part doesn't affect it. Because the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables, so they won't interfere with the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. \n\nWait, so does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, regardless of the second part? That seems too straightforward. Let me check again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. It says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the entire expression, which includes both parts. So, perhaps the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, and when multiplied together, the terms could combine in a way that affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, actually, since the second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), and the first part is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), there's no overlap between the variables. So, when you multiply them, the terms would be products of terms from each expansion, but each product would involve both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms and \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) terms. \n\nWait, but the problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part would contribute a term that's a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by something involving \\(c\\), it's still \\(a^2b^2\\) times that something. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe it's considering all possible coefficients from the entire expression, but I'm not sure. \n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the products where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some term from the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the first part, and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is actually 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not a polynomial. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps we need to consider the constant term in the second expansion, because only then would \\(a^2b^2\\) be multiplied by 1 (the constant term), resulting in \\(a^2b^2\\) itself. \n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (the coefficient from the first part) multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then multiply it by 6 to get the final coefficient. \n\nAlright, so let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\): \\(6 = 2k\\) \u2192 \\(k = 3\\). \n\nSo, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). \n\nWait, no, let me check that calculation again. \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is actually \\(\\dfrac{6 \\times 5 \\times 4}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 20\\). Yes, that's correct. So, the constant term is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, in the product, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear is if it's multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nBut let me think again: when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and the constant term 20 from the second part, then \\(a^2b^2 \\times 20\\) is a term in the product, so the coefficient is 20 times 6, which is 120. \n\nAlternatively, if I had a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but since the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only contribution comes from the constant term in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but let me consider another approach. Maybe the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and when you expand this, each term in the product will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(k = 2\\) in the first part, and from \\(m = 3\\) in the second part, because that's where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nWait, that seems consistent with what I found earlier. So, I think that's correct. \n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me check with specific examples. Suppose I set \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), \\(c = 1\\), then evaluate the expression and see what the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be. \n\nSo, \\((1 + 1)^4 = 16\\), and \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the entire expression evaluates to \\(16 \\times 64 = 1024\\). \n\nBut if I set \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), \\(c = 1\\), then \\(a^2b^2 = 1\\), and the coefficient would be the number of times \\(a^2b^2\\) appears in the expansion, which is 120, as we found. But wait, when \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), \\(c = 1\\), the entire expression is 1024, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 1, so the coefficient would be 120 times 1, which is 120. But how does that relate to 1024? Hmm, maybe this approach isn't the best way to check. \n\nAlternatively, let me try to compute the coefficient another way. Let me expand both parts separately and see. \n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\) has terms: \n- \\(a^4\\)\n- \\(4a^3b\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2\\)\n- \\(4ab^3\\)\n- \\(b^4\\)\n\nAnd \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has terms:\n- \\(c^6\\)\n- \\(6c^4\\)\n- \\(15c^2\\)\n- \\(20\\) (the constant term)\n- \\(15/c^2\\)\n- \\(6/c^4\\)\n- \\(1/c^6\\)\n\nSo, when we multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only consider the term where the second part is 1 (the constant term). So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is indeed 120. \n\nI think I've thought this through thoroughly. The key was realizing that since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if it's multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 times 20, giving 120. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me apply the binomial theorem here. So, that would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2 because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).

Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nWait a second, but the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider both parts. Hmm, does that mean I have to multiply each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? That sounds like a lot of terms, but maybe I don't need all of them. Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps I can focus only on the part where the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are squared, and the rest will involve \\(c\\) terms which I might not need to compute in detail.\n\nWait, but actually, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think that any terms involving \\(c\\) would just tag along, but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe we can treat the second part as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Hmm, but that doesn't seem right because the second part is another binomial expansion. \n\nWait, maybe I should think differently. Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the \\(c\\) terms in the second part will affect the overall coefficient, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only concerned with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), maybe the coefficient from the second part just multiplies the 6 we found earlier. But wait, that might not be the case because the second part is also an expansion, so perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, if I think of the entire product as a product of two separate expansions, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all the terms, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit off. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then since the second part is a separate expansion, the overall coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient isn't a single number, which contradicts the problem's wording.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of the entire expression, considering all terms. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the only way that term appears is when it's multiplied by the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term in the second expansion that has \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), then the resulting term would involve \\(c\\), which isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nAh, that makes sense. So, first, I find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when I multiply those two, the constant term will be the only one that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so the product term will just be \\(6 \\times\\) (constant term). So, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the constant term in the second part is 20, so when multiplied together, it's 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Let me think if there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the entire expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations. The binomial coefficients are correct, and the exponents add up properly. So, I think the answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2.

Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all the terms, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the question is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would involve combining the coefficients from both parts. \n\nWait, but if I think about it, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial multiplies each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are separate from the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, if I do that, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nBut I'm not sure if that's correct because I think the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient, maybe it's expecting a numerical value, so perhaps I need to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion, but since the problem doesn't specify a particular power of \\(c\\), it's just the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because in the product, each term will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents and \\(c\\) exponents. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Or perhaps the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but looking back at the problem, it says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut coefficients are usually numerical, not expressions. So, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), so the coefficient when the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. That is, the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). \n\nWait, that might make sense. Because if you have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then when you multiply them, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion, but if we're looking for the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, that is, the constant term, then we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). \n\nYes, that seems more likely. So, the problem is probably asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). \n\nSo, let's proceed with that understanding. \n\nFirst, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I calculated earlier. \n\nNext, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nTo find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. \n\nThe expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\) so \\(k = 3\\). \n\nTherefore, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). \n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. \n\nNow, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we multiply the coefficients from each part. \n\nThat is, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, let me confirm that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, when we multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will multiply the constant term from the second part, giving \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. \n\nBut the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so maybe it's expecting just the coefficient from the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts, but considering the entire expression, which includes \\(c\\). So, perhaps the correct interpretation is that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nLet me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem: correct, and found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. \n\n2. Then, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, I need to consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n3. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion. \n\n4. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But coefficients are usually numerical, so that doesn't make sense. \n\n5. Therefore, it's more likely that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). \n\n6. So, I calculated that the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. \n\n7. Then, multiplying 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)) gives 120. \n\nYes, that seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem was just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, it's more likely that it's asking for the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " \n\nIn this case, the expression is \\((a + b)^4\\). So, I can expand this part first. Let me do that. The binomial expansion for \\((a + b)^4\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}ab^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}b^4\\). Calculating the coefficients, \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} = 1\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} = 4\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} = 4\\), and \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} = 1\\). So, the expansion is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). \n\nOkay, so that takes care of the first part. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I think I need to expand this part as well, but wait, the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I don't need to expand the entire \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part. Instead, perhaps I can focus on the terms that will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion. \n\nLet me think. The overall expression is the product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since these two parts are multiplied together, the variables involved are a, b, c, and 1/c. But the term we're interested in is \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve c or 1/c. That means, when we multiply the terms from the two expansions, only the constant term (the term without c) from the second expansion will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, is that right? Because if I take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and multiply it by a term from the second part, the only way the resulting term will be \\(a^2b^2\\) is if the term from the second part is a constant (since c and 1/c are variables, and we don't want any c terms in the final product). So, I think I need to find the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nOkay, so let me try to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nNow, the constant term is the term where the exponent of c is zero. So, I need to solve \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) for k. Solving, \\(6 = 2k\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when I multiply the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the only term that will contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) is the \\(6a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion multiplied by the 20 constant term from the second expansion. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, from the first expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and from the second expansion, the constant term is 20. When you multiply these two parts together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes 6*20=120. Yeah, that seems right. \n\nI don't think I missed anything here. The variables c and 1/c don't interfere with the \\(a^2b^2\\) term because they are multiplied by other terms that would introduce c or 1/c, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), those terms won't affect it. So, the coefficient is indeed 120. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so looking at \\((a + b)^4\\), I can expand this as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I should find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would happen when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), right? So, plugging in \\(k = 2\\), the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6.\n\nNow, the expression also has \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder if this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), their exponents shouldn't interfere, right? So, when I multiply the two expansions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will multiply the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. \n\nWait, let me make sure. So, if I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). Then, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will multiply each term in the second expansion. But since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider just the \\(6a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part. \n\nHowever, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), the coefficient will just be 6 times whatever the coefficient is from the second part when it's multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial multiplies each term from the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's the same as the coefficient in the first part, because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) at all. Therefore, the coefficient remains 6.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes only from the first expansion, and when multiplied by any term from the second expansion, it will just carry along the \\(c\\) terms. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient is just 6, because each multiplication by a term from the second expansion would just add different powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself doesn't change. \n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because when you multiply by something, you might have to consider if the second expansion has any constants or something. Let me check. The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which expands to terms involving \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\) with respective coefficients. So, when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, I'll get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, each of these terms has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). However, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term from the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from the second part. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we can treat the second part as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the second expansion isn't a constant. Let me think again. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term in the second expansion will create a new term in the product, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the same as the coefficient in the first part, because each term from the second part is just a multiple of \\(c\\) raised to some power, which doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) remains 6, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms.\n\nWait, but that seems counterintuitive. Let me try a smaller example to check. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion would be \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this case would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, but in the first part, \\((a + b)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) is 1, \\(a^1b^1\\) is 2, and \\(a^0b^2\\) is 1. So, when you multiply by \\((c + 1/c)\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2\\) becomes \\(a^2c\\) and \\(a^2 \\times 1/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product is 1 times (1 + 1) = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2 times (1 + 1) = 4. But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present in the first expansion, so it remains zero. \n\nWait, so in this small example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero, which makes sense because the first expansion only goes up to \\(a^2b^0\\) and \\(a^0b^2\\). So, in our original problem, the first expansion is \\((a + b)^4\\), which does have a term \\(a^2b^2\\). When multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which are all terms with different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself, regardless of the \\(c\\) term, is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6. \n\nWait, but in the small example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) was zero because it wasn't present in the first expansion. So, in our problem, since it is present, the coefficient would be 6, as the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6. \n\nWait, but I'm still a bit confused because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you're adding more terms, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, their coefficients shouldn't be affected by \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) remains 6. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient being 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of the terms that multiply to give that term. But in this case, since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, let me compute the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. The second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, if the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, that would be 384. But that seems too high. \n\nWait, no, that can't be right because in the small example, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion was 2, and the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) became 2, which is 1 times 2. So, in that case, it worked. So, perhaps in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier thought. Let me see. If I have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then when I multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion (which is 6a^2b^2) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when multiplied by 6a^2b^2, it contributes 6 times that coefficient to the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for each k. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum all those contributions. \n\nSo, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\( (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me check with the small example again. If I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) should be zero because the first expansion doesn't have \\(a^2b^2\\). But according to this method, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 2, and the coefficient in the first part for \\(a^2b^0\\) is 1, so 1 * 2 = 2, but that's not the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) times the sum of the second expansion. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is still zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion. \n\nSo, in our problem, since the first expansion does have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's correct because in the small example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) was zero, which aligns with the fact that the first expansion didn't have that term. So, in our problem, since the first expansion does have \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient being 6 times the entire second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is a polynomial, not a scalar. So, perhaps the correct way is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but let me think differently. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient in the first part, because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, when you multiply by the second part, you're just scaling each term in the first expansion by the entire second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire second expansion, but that would mean it's a polynomial, not a scalar. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^l c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^l c^{-m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Because each term in the second expansion contributes to a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). So, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nSince the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\( (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me confirm this with another approach. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by considering the product of the coefficients from each part. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is simply the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion isn't a scalar. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient in the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, it's just 6. \n\nWait, but that contradicts the earlier reasoning where I thought it's 384. I'm getting confused here. Let me try to see which one is correct. \n\nIf I consider the product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then when I expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. Therefore, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 6, and so on. \n\nHowever, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, if we're considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, each multiplied by 6. Because each term in the second expansion contributes a multiple of \\(a^2b^2\\) with different \\(c\\) exponents. \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but in the small example, if I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero, which is correct because the first expansion doesn't have that term. But if I have \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient remains 6. \n\nBut that doesn't make sense because when you multiply by the second expansion, you're scaling each term by all the terms in the second expansion, which would change the coefficients. \n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient for each of those terms is 6. So, if you're summing all the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\), then the total coefficient would be 6 times the number of terms in the second expansion, which is 7 (from \\(c^6\\) to \\(c^{-6}\\) in steps of 2). But that's not correct because the second expansion has 7 terms, each with their own coefficients. \n\nWait, no, the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\) with coefficients given by the binomial coefficients. So, the sum of the coefficients is 64, as calculated before. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut let me check this with another approach. Let's consider the entire product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) because the other part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, it's just 6. But that seems contradictory because when you multiply by the second expansion, you're scaling each term. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which includes all the \\(c\\) terms. So, if we're considering the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, but if we're considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), then it's 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. \n\nBut the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying any \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, it's ambiguous. However, in polynomial terms, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term, it's usually in the entire polynomial, considering all variables. But in this case, since \\(c\\) is another variable, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nWait, but that seems too large. Let me think again. The second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has terms \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64. So, when you multiply each of these by \\(6a^2b^2\\), you get terms \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6, \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 36, and so on. \n\nBut if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's the sum of all these coefficients, which is 6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6 = 384. \n\nWait, let me calculate that: \n\n- \\(6c^6\\) gives 6\n- \\(6 \\times 6c^4 = 36c^4\\)\n- \\(6 \\times 15c^2 = 90c^2\\)\n- \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\)\n- \\(6 \\times 15c^{-2} = 90c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(6 \\times 6c^{-4} = 36c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(6 \\times c^{-6} = 6c^{-6}\\)\n\nAdding these coefficients: 6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6 = \n\n6 + 36 = 42\n\n42 + 90 = 132\n\n132 + 120 = 252\n\n252 + 90 = 342\n\n342 + 36 = 378\n\n378 + 6 = 384\n\nYes, that adds up to 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384. \n\nBut wait, that seems a bit high, but considering the second expansion has a sum of coefficients 64, and 6 times 64 is 384, it makes sense. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then it's just 6. But given the way the problem is phrased, I think it's asking for the coefficient in the entire product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, the answer should be 384. \n\nWait, but let me check with another approach. Let's consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in each part. But the second part doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so its coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero. Wait, no, that can't be right because the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), so it doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). \n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient in the first part times the coefficient of the term in the second part that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). But since the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the only term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is the constant term, which is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by the constant term 20, you get \\(120a^2b^2\\). All other terms in the second expansion involve \\(c\\) to some power, so they don't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier reasoning where I thought it was 384. I'm getting confused again. Let me try to clarify. \n\nThe problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. If we're considering the entire product, which includes all possible powers of \\(c\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. But if we're only considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 times the constant term from the second expansion. \n\nI think the problem is ambiguous, but in most cases, when asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's without considering other variables, so it's 6 times the constant term from the second expansion. \n\nSo, let's compute the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in the expansion, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). We set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, that makes sense because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by the constant term 20, you get \\(120a^2b^2\\), which is the only term in the product that has \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. All other terms would have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), but if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 120. \n\nBut earlier, I thought it was 384, but that was when considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). However, if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms, then it's 120. \n\nWait, let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so it's ambiguous. However, in most mathematical contexts, when asked for the coefficient of a term in a product involving multiple variables, it's usually considering the term without the other variables unless specified otherwise. So, in this case, it's likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, which would be 120. \n\nAlternatively, if it's considering the entire product, including all powers of \\(c\\), then it's 384. But I think the standard interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so the answer is 120. \n\nWait, but let me think again. If the problem had said \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)\", then it would be 120. But since it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), it's ambiguous. However, given that \\(c\\) is another variable, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear with different powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of \\(c\\). Therefore, it's 384. \n\nBut I'm still not sure. Let me see if I can find a reference or similar problem. \n\nUpon reflection, I think the correct interpretation is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all coefficients in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). Therefore, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nWait, but that would mean that the coefficient is 384, which seems high, but it's consistent with the expansion. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), then it's 384. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. \n\nGiven the problem statement, I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so the answer is 384. \n\nBut I'm still not entirely confident. Let me try to think of it another way. The entire expression is a product of two polynomials. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum over all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some term from the second expansion. So, each such term contributes 6 times the coefficient of that term in the second expansion. Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 384. \n\nWait, but I just realized that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of the terms whose exponents add up to that term. In this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't affect the exponents of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is simply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nSo, the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. \n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake earlier. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually the coefficient in the first part multiplied by the entire second part. But since the second part is a polynomial, the coefficient would be a polynomial as well. But the problem is asking for a scalar coefficient, so it's likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), meaning the constant term. \n\nWait, but in that case, it's 6 times the constant term of the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120. \n\nI'm getting conflicting conclusions here. Let me try to clarify once more. \n\nThe problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nIf we interpret this as the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion multiplied by 6, which is 384. \n\nIf we interpret it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), then it's 6 times the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120. \n\nI think the correct interpretation is the latter, because in polynomial terms, when you ask for the coefficient of a specific term, it's usually without considering other variables unless specified. So, in this case, it's likely 120. \n\nWait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me see. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's the same as the coefficient in the first expansion, because the second expansion doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, it's 6. But that seems too simplistic because when you multiply by the second expansion, you're scaling each term. \n\nWait, no, because the second expansion is a separate polynomial, so when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes to a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). \n\nSo, if we're considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), then the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut if we're only considering the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nGiven the problem statement, it's ambiguous, but I think the intended interpretation is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, because the second expansion doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. But that seems incorrect because when you multiply by the second expansion, you're scaling each term. \n\nWait, perhaps the confusion comes from whether the problem is treating \\(c\\) as a variable or as part of the coefficient. If \\(c\\) is a variable, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, because the second expansion is a separate polynomial. But if \\(c\\) is part of the coefficient, then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nBut in standard polynomial terms, each variable is independent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6, because the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient remains 6. \n\nWait, but that contradicts the earlier reasoning where I thought it was 384. I'm really confused now. Let me try to think of it differently. \n\nImagine that \\(c\\) is a variable, so when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients of the product are the products of the coefficients of the terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be formed by multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion by any term from the second expansion, regardless of the power of \\("

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so let's start with the first part, which is \\((a + b)^4\\). I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which would be \\(a^2b^2\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I want the term where the exponent of \\(a\\) is 2, so that would mean \\(4 - k = 2\\), which implies \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part of the expression, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). This also looks like a binomial expansion, so I can apply the binomial theorem here as well. The general term in this expansion would be \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWait a second, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but the second part of the expression involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), their exponents don't interfere. That means when I multiply the two expansions together, the term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), I realize that I might have made a mistake here.\n\nWait, no, actually, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply these two expansions, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find all the terms in the second expansion that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), result in a term that still has \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). So, actually, every term in the second expansion will just multiply the entire first expansion, but since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can treat the second part as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). \n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand this, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\). So, the term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\) in the first expansion, which gives \\(a^2b^2\\), and then it's multiplied by the entire second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means I need to consider how the second expansion affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, actually, no. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the second expansion, which is in terms of \\(c\\), the only way to get a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\) is if the second expansion contributes a term with \\(c^0\\), because \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0 = a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), and then multiply that by the coefficient from the first part, which is 6.\n\nSo, let's focus on finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the constant term in the second expansion is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients from both expansions. From the first part, it's 6, and from the second part, it's 20. So, multiplying these together, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, when I multiply the two expansions, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. However, only the terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero in the second expansion will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) term, making it \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), which isn't what we want. \n\nTherefore, the only contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the constant term in the second expansion, which we found to be 20. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations. For the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. That's correct. For the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) gives \\(m = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is indeed 20. So, 6 \u00d7 20 is 120. \n\nI think that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by expanding each part separately and then multiplying the relevant coefficients. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) to find the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0). This term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiply these coefficients together: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " \n\nLet me write down the expansion for \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, that would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\), where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. \n\nI'm specifically looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each. That means \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), so \\(k = 2\\). So, the term when \\(k = 2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). \n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), that's \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient. \n\nHmm, so I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are only in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\). That means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the other terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect it. \n\nWait, actually, that might not be correct. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But in this case, the first polynomial is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in terms of \\(c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, their exponents don't interfere with each other. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. \n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first expansion, when you multiply it by the entire second expansion, you'll get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), and so on. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, I think I need to consider all possible ways that \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product. \n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first part, so when you multiply by the second part, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but the variables are separate. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But wait, that can't be right because the second expansion is a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\), so unless the second expansion is a constant, which it's not, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in the first part, because multiplying by other terms won't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me think differently. Maybe I should consider that the entire expression is the product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all independent. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all the coefficients in the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing their coefficients to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), we need to sum all the coefficients from the second polynomial. \n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, let me check that logic. If I have two polynomials, \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\) is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\), because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing their coefficients to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), we need to sum all the coefficients from \\(Q(c)\\). \n\nSo, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nHow do I find the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial? I remember that the sum of coefficients is found by evaluating the polynomial at \\(c = 1\\). Because when \\(c = 1\\), each term becomes just its coefficient. So, let's compute \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Is it correct to say that the sum of coefficients is 64? Let me think about \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanded, it's a Laurent polynomial with terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\), each with certain coefficients. The sum of all coefficients is indeed found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, that part is correct. \n\nAlternatively, I could think about it as the sum of the coefficients being the same as the evaluation at \\(c = 1\\), which is 64. So, yes, that seems right. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe I should consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients combine differently. But in this case, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all separate variables, the coefficients for each combination of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are independent of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think my reasoning is correct, and the final answer should be 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

That means that when I expand the entire expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But wait, that doesn't sound right either because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, so when I multiply, the terms won't combine in a way that affects the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of the entire expression as the product of two separate expansions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because when you multiply, each term is a product, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), if I set \\(c = 1\\), then it becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit high. Let me check if I'm doing this correctly. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. The problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, the coefficient would indeed be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you have two separate polynomials multiplied together, like (P(a,b))(Q(c)), the coefficient of a specific term in P, say \\(a^2b^2\\), when multiplied by Q(c), would indeed be the coefficient from P times the entire Q(c). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * (sum of coefficients in Q(c)). The sum of coefficients in Q(c) is Q(1), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, yes, it's 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the coefficient being 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but when you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just the coefficient from the first part times the entire second part, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, yeah, that would make the coefficient 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have (a + b)^2 * (c + 1/c)^1. Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from (a + b)^2, which is 1 (since \\(\\dbinom{2}{2} = 1\\)), times the sum of coefficients in (c + 1/c)^1, which is (1 + 1) = 2. So, the coefficient would be 1 * 2 = 2. Let me expand it: (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2. (c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c. Multiplying them together: (a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c) = a^2c + a^2/c + 2ab c + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, that contradicts my earlier reasoning. Hmm, so maybe my earlier approach is wrong.\n\nWait, in this example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because in the product, you can't get \\(a^2b^2\\) unless you multiply \\(a^2\\) by something that has \\(b^2\\), but in the second polynomial, there's no \\(b\\). So, in this case, the coefficient is zero, not 1 * 2 = 2. So, my earlier reasoning was incorrect. So, that means that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is zero because you can't form \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplying by terms that don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\).\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which only involves \\(c\\), so when you multiply by it, you can't get any terms involving \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) from it. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Wait, but that can't be right because in the example, when I had (a + b)^2 * (c + 1/c), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) was zero, not the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients from the second part.\n\nWait, so maybe the correct approach is that since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by any term from the second part, but since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's just 1 times the sum of coefficients from the second part. Wait, but in the example, that would mean the coefficient is 1 * 2 = 2, but in reality, it's zero because you can't form \\(a^2b^2\\) by multiplying \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) with anything from the second part because the second part doesn't have \\(b\\). Wait, so maybe my initial approach was wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing how the multiplication works. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term will be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so when you collect like terms, the coefficient becomes 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part.\n\nBut in my earlier example, that approach gave me the wrong answer. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, in the example, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present because you can't get \\(b^2\\) from the second part. So, the coefficient is zero, not 1 * 2 = 2. Therefore, my initial approach was wrong.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is that since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by 1 (since the second part is multiplied by 1 when considering only the terms that don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\)). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is being multiplied by every term in the first part.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that the entire product is a product of two polynomials, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial, because when you multiply, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. But in the example, that gave me the wrong answer.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that in the example, \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present because the second part can't contribute to \\(b^2\\), but in the original problem, the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so it's similar. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, in the original problem, the coefficient would be 6, not 6 times 64.\n\nWait, but that contradicts the initial thought. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, say P(a, b) * Q(c), the coefficient of a specific term in P, say \\(a^2b^2\\), when multiplied by Q(c), would be the coefficient from P times the entire Q(c). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in Q(c), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from P times the sum of coefficients in Q(c). But in the example, that gave me the wrong answer because \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present in the product. So, perhaps the correct approach is that since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient is just the coefficient from P times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in Q(c), which is the constant term.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in Q(c), the only term that would result in a term without \\(c\\) is the constant term in Q(c). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from P times the constant term in Q(c).\n\nSo, in the example, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the constant term in Q(c) is zero because \\((c + 1/c)\\) has terms \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but no constant term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 1 (from P) times 0 (constant term in Q) = 0, which matches the actual expansion.\n\nIn the original problem, the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's find the constant term in this expansion. The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). We need this exponent to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) \u2192 \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, that's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that makes more sense now. So, I was initially mistaken by thinking it was the sum of all coefficients, but actually, it's the constant term in the second part because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so only the constant term would multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) to give a term without \\(c\\). So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nLet me verify this with the example again. In \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the constant term in \\((c + 1/c)\\) is zero, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 1 * 0 = 0, which is correct. If I had \\((a + b)^2 \\times (1 + c + 1/c)\\), the constant term would be 1, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 1 * 1 = 1, which would make sense because the product would have a term \\(a^2b^2 * 1 = a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, applying this to the original problem, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making another mistake. Let me compute the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when does 6 - 2k = 0? When k = 3. So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). So, yes, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct by considering the entire expansion. Let me take a simpler case where I can compute both parts.\n\nSuppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^2\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the constant term in the second part. The coefficient from \\((a + b)^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{2}{2} = 1\\). The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^2\\) is when k = 1, because 2 - 2k = 0 \u2192 k = 1. So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{2}{1} = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) should be 1 * 2 = 2.\n\nLet me expand it manually: \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). Now, multiply them:\n\n(a^2)(c^2) + (a^2)(2) + (a^2)(1/c^2) + (2ab)(c^2) + (2ab)(2) + (2ab)(1/c^2) + (b^2)(c^2) + (b^2)(2) + (b^2)(1/c^2).\n\nLooking for \\(a^2b^2\\), but I don't see any \\(a^2b^2\\) terms here. Wait, that's strange. So, in this case, the coefficient is zero, but according to my earlier reasoning, it should be 2. Hmm, that's a problem. So, perhaps my approach is wrong.\n\nWait, but in this case, the product is \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), which when expanded doesn't have any \\(a^2b^2\\) term because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, the coefficient should be zero, not 2. Therefore, my reasoning that the coefficient is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the constant term from the second part is incorrect.\n\nWait, so what's the issue here? It seems that when the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is if the second part contributes a term that's 1, but in reality, the second part is a separate variable, so it doesn't affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, because the second part is being multiplied by 1 (the multiplicative identity) for the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because when you multiply by the entire second part, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, it's multiplied by each term in the second part, which are powers of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would appear multiplied by \\(c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is if the second part contributes a \\(c^0\\) term, which is 1. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part.\n\nBut in the example I just did, the second part \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^2\\) has a constant term of 2, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) should be 1 * 2 = 2, but when I expanded it, I didn't see any \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, that's confusing. Let me check the expansion again.\n\nWait, when I expand \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), I get terms like \\(a^2c^2\\), \\(a^2*2\\), \\(a^2*(1/c^2)\\), \\(2ab c^2\\), \\(2ab*2\\), \\(2ab*(1/c^2)\\), \\(b^2c^2\\), \\(b^2*2\\), and \\(b^2*(1/c^2)\\). So, the terms without \\(c\\) are \\(a^2*2\\), \\(2ab*2\\), and \\(b^2*2\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present because none of these terms have both \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) without \\(c\\). The only terms without \\(c\\) are \\(2a^2\\), \\(4ab\\), and \\(2b^2\\). So, there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term, which means the coefficient is zero, not 2. So, my earlier reasoning is wrong again.\n\nThis suggests that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is zero, not 2. Therefore, my approach is flawed.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which includes all terms from both expansions. But since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is if the second part contributes a term that is 1, but in reality, the second part is a separate variable, so it can't contribute to \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\).\n\nWait, but in the example, that would mean the coefficient is 1, but when I expanded it, it was zero. So, that can't be right either. I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is that since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first part times the entire second part evaluated at \\(c = 1\\), which gives the sum of coefficients. But in the example, that would be 1 * (1 + 1)^2 = 4, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero, so that's not correct either.\n\nI'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for another approach. Let me think again about the original problem: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSince \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get that term is to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part.\n\nIn the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nIn the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Setting \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but in my earlier example with \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), this approach would give me 1 * 2 = 2, but when I expanded it, the coefficient was zero. So, why is that? Let me check that example again.\n\nIn \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the constant term from the second part. The first part's coefficient is 1, the second part's constant term is 2, so 1 * 2 = 2. But when I expanded it, I didn't see any \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the expansion.\n\nWait, when I expand \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), I get:\n\n\\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2)\\).\n\nMultiplying term by term:\n\n- \\(a^2 \\times c^2 = a^2c^2\\)\n- \\(a^2 \\times 2 = 2a^2\\)\n- \\(a^2 \\times 1/c^2 = a^2/c^2\\)\n- \\(2ab \\times c^2 = 2ab c^2\\)\n- \\(2ab \\times 2 = 4ab\\)\n- \\(2ab \\times 1/c^2 = 4ab/c^2\\)\n- \\(b^2 \\times c^2 = b^2c^2\\)\n- \\(b^2 \\times 2 = 2b^2\\)\n- \\(b^2 \\times 1/c^2 = b^2/c^2\\)\n\nLooking for \\(a^2b^2\\), but I don't see any term with both \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient is zero, which contradicts the earlier approach.\n\nWait, so what's the issue here? It seems that when the second part has a constant term, but the first part's term is \\(a^2b^2\\), which isn't present in the product because \\(a^2b^2\\) can't be formed by multiplying terms from the two parts unless the second part contributes both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), which it doesn't. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is zero.\n\nBut that contradicts the earlier approach where I thought it's 1 * 2 = 2. So, perhaps my initial assumption is wrong. Therefore, maybe the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because the second part doesn't contribute any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, so you can't form \\(a^2b^2\\) by multiplying terms from the two parts.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply by it, you can't get any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is zero.\n\nBut that can't be right because when I computed the constant term in the second part, it was 20, and the coefficient from the first part was 6, so 6 * 20 = 120. But in the example, it gave me zero, which suggests that the approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion comes from the fact that in the original problem, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get it is to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by the constant term from the second part, which is 20. So, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut in the example, when I did \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), the constant term was 2, and the coefficient from the first part was 1, so 1 * 2 = 2, but when I expanded it, there was no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, that suggests that my approach is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that in the original problem, the second part is raised to the 6th power, which includes a constant term, but in the example, the second part is squared, which also includes a constant term, but the product doesn't have \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe the correct answer is zero because you can't form \\(a^2b^2\\) by multiplying terms from the two parts.\n\nWait, but that seems counterintuitive because the constant term in the second part is a scalar, so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by that scalar, you should get a term \\(a^2b^2\\) times that scalar. But in the example, when I expanded it, I didn't see such a term. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the expansion.\n\nWait, let me try expanding \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\) again. The expansion is:\n\n\\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2)\\).\n\nMultiplying term by term:\n\n- \\(a^2 \\times c^2 = a^2c^2\\)\n- \\(a^2 \\times 2 = 2a^2\\)\n- \\(a^2 \\times 1/c^2 = a^2/c^2\\)\n- \\(2ab \\times c^2 = 2ab c^2\\)\n- \\(2ab \\times 2 = 4ab\\)\n- \\(2ab \\times 1/c^2 = 4ab/c^2\\)\n- \\(b^2 \\times c^2 = b^2c^2\\)\n- \\(b^2 \\times 2 = 2b^2\\)\n- \\(b^2 \\times 1/c^2 = b^2/c^2\\)\n\nSo, the terms without \\(c\\) are \\(2a^2\\), \\(4ab\\), and \\(2b^2\\). There is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient is zero. Therefore, my initial approach was wrong, and the correct answer is zero.\n\nWait, but that contradicts the earlier reasoning. So, perhaps the correct answer is zero because you can't form \\(a^2b^2\\) by multiplying terms from the two parts, as the second part doesn't contribute any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient is zero.\n\nBut in the original problem, the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply by it, you can't get any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero.\n\nWait, but that seems counterintuitive because the second part has a constant term, which is a scalar, so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by that scalar, you should get a term \\(a^2b^2\\) times that scalar. But in the example, that didn't happen because the constant term was multiplied by \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) separately, not together.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion comes from whether the constant term is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) or not. In reality, the constant term is a scalar, so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term, you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that scalar. So, in the example, the constant term is 2, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) should be 1 * 2 = 2. But when I expanded it, I didn't see that term. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the expansion.\n\nWait, in the expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from multiplying \\(a^2\\) by \\(b^2\\), but in the product, each term is a product of a term from the first polynomial and a term from the second. So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), you would need to multiply \\(a^2\\) from the first part by \\(b^2\\) from the second part, but the second part doesn't have \\(b^2\\). Therefore, you can't get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product because the second part doesn't involve \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient is zero.\n\nSo, in the original problem, the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so you can't get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, so the coefficient is zero.\n\nWait, but that contradicts the earlier reasoning where I thought it was 120. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that in the original problem, the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply by it, you can't form any terms with \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero.\n\nBut that seems too restrictive because, for example, if the second part had terms involving \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), you could form \\(a^2b^2\\). But since it doesn't, the coefficient is zero.\n\nWait, but in the initial example, the coefficient was zero, so maybe the answer is zero.

    "text": " \n\nSo, looking at \\((a + b)^4\\), I can expand this part first. Let me write that out. The expansion would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Calculating the coefficients, that would be \\(1a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider both expansions because the entire expression is the product of these two binomials raised to powers. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and then I need to multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nHowever, the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That is, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms can be anything because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. \n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, the entire expression is the product of two expansions, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But when we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's actually just the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by something, it doesn't change the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so all the terms from the second expansion will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nBut wait, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and the constant term (if any) from the second expansion. Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), that would give me \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), which are different terms. Therefore, the only way to get a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\) is if the second factor contributes a term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0 = 1\\). \n\nSo, I need to find the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Once I find that, I can multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion, which is 6, to get the final coefficient. \n\nAlright, so let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, this expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\) so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), so the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when we multiply these two parts together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), we need to find the term in the second expansion that doesn't change the \\(c\\) exponent. As we found earlier, that's the constant term, which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nHmm, that seems right. Let me think if there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, I could consider that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. Since the second part has a coefficient of 20 for \\(c^0\\), and the first part has 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think that makes sense. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, the coefficient should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by multiplying the coefficient from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3.

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6. \n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That means I also need to consider the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I guess I need to multiply these two expansions together. But how exactly does that work?\n\nLet me think. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, every term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I don't need to worry about the terms from the second polynomial affecting the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, right? Because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables. So, maybe I can treat them independently.\n\nWait, but actually, when you multiply the two expressions, the variables \\(a, b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), so the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't affect the terms involving \\(c\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that means I just need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(c\\) terms won't interfere with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. \n\nIs that correct? Let me verify. So, if I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\), when expanding, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second. So, for example, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^5\\), etc. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), it's actually asking for the sum of all the products where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. \n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term on its own, and when multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^5\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself in the entire product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part. But that seems a bit off because the second part isn't a constant. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but no, it just says \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but the question is only asking for the coefficient of the \\(a^2b^2\\) part, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that the coefficient is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a number. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible terms, but only focusing on the \\(a^2b^2\\) part regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that still doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be the sum over all possible \\(k\\) of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) in the expansion. But that would require knowing the coefficients of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiplying each by 6 and summing them up. But that seems complicated, and I don't think that's what the problem is asking.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^5\\), \\(15c^4\\), \\(20c^3\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(6c\\), and \\(1\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by each term in the second part. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think that means we're considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any combination of \\(c\\) terms. But in reality, each multiplication would create a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself, without any \\(c\\) terms, would just be the coefficient from the first part times the constant term in the second part.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, let me find that. Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the constant term is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2. When we multiply this by the second part, which includes the constant term 20, we get 6 * 20 a\u00b2b\u00b2 = 120a\u00b2b\u00b2. So, the coefficient is 120. \n\nIs that correct? Let me think again. If I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by all terms in the second part, but the only way to get a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\) (without any \\(c\\) terms) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion. Otherwise, you would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c\\), \\(a^2b^2/c\\), etc., which are not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but since it's not specified, I think it's safe to assume that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the constant term. So, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Setting the exponent to zero: 6 - 2k = 0 => k = 3. So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), which is correct. So, that part is fine.\n\nAnd in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). So, multiplying 6 by 20 gives 120. \n\nI think that's the correct answer. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " \n\nSo, let's start with the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this should expand to \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, in the expansion, \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\), I want \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). That makes sense because if \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). Okay, so that part is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I guess I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, the \\(c\\) terms are separate from the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, right? So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't get multiplied by anything else because \\(c\\) and \\(a\\), \\(b\\) are different variables. Let me think about that.\n\nWait, no, that might not be right. Because the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two polynomials together, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will get multiplied by every term in the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, any term in the second part that involves \\(c\\) will result in a term that includes \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would make it a different term altogether. Therefore, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if it's multiplied by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nAh, so I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because that's the only term that won't introduce any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) into the product, thus keeping the term \\(a^2b^2\\) as is. So, let me work on that.\n\nAgain, using the binomial theorem for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nI need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 6! is 720, and 3! is 6, so 6!/(3!3!) = 720/(6*6) = 720/36 = 20. Yes, that's correct. So, the constant term is 20.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part has a coefficient of 6, and it gets multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part. Therefore, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me just double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a constant term 20, so when multiplied together, 6 * 20 is indeed 120. So, yeah, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about the entire expansion. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient from the first part is 6, and from the second part, we need the term where \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\) is \\(c^0\\), so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) leading to \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is 20. So, when you multiply these, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but another thought: does the multiplication affect anything else? For example, could there be other terms that when multiplied together result in \\(a^2b^2\\)? But since the second polynomial only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), and the first polynomial involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), there's no overlap between the variables. So, when you multiply a term from the first polynomial by a term from the second, the variables are separate. Therefore, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiply it by the constant term from the second polynomial. So, I don't need to worry about any other terms interfering because they would involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which aren't part of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nTherefore, I think my earlier conclusion is correct: the coefficient is 120. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using binomial theorem: coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using binomial theorem: find the constant term, which is when exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(m = 3\\), coefficient is 20.\n3. Multiply these coefficients together: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that seems solid. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations. The binomial coefficients are correct, and the logic about the constant term is sound because any other term would involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which wouldn't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.\n\nSo, I think the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The expansion is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the two coefficients:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so let me start by expanding \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, that would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Calculating the coefficients, \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} = 1\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} = 4\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} = 4\\), and \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} = 1\\). So, expanding that, I get \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). \n\nOkay, so I'm looking for the term with \\(a^2b^2\\), which in this expansion is \\(6a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient here is 6. But wait, the problem isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the only term that will result in a term without \\(c\\) is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because any other term will have \\(c\\) raised to some power, which would make the overall term have \\(c\\) in it. \n\nSo, essentially, I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because that's the only term that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will give me a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) involved. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nAlright, so now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k}\\) which is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nSo, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). I need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so I set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), I get \\(6 = 2k\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(k = 3\\) is the one with \\(c^0\\). \n\nCalculating the coefficient for \\(k = 3\\), we have \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is calculated as \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. \n\nTherefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 times 20 is 120. \n\nWait, let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent is zero is when \\(k = 3\\), which gives a coefficient of 20. Multiplying them together gives 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems right. \n\nI don't think I missed anything here. The key was recognizing that when you multiply two expressions, the terms that contribute to a specific term in the product are those where the exponents add up appropriately. In this case, since I wanted \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), I needed to find the term in the second expression that cancels out the \\(c\\) terms, which is the \\(c^0\\) term. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient is 120.

So, the terms will be from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\), each multiplied by their respective binomial coefficients. \n\nNow, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to find the term where the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), right? Because \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\), so when \\(k = 2\\), we have \\(a^{2}b^{2}\\). \n\nLet me calculate the binomial coefficient for this term. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). I remember that \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} = \\dfrac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\\). Plugging in the numbers: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nWait, but hold on. The original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I can't just stop here. I need to consider the entire expression. \n\nHmm, so maybe I should think about how the multiplication works. The entire expression is the product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply them together, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. \n\nBut the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other part is with \\(c\\). So, when I multiply, the terms from the second expansion will involve powers of \\(c\\), but since we're looking for a term without \\(c\\), maybe only the constant term in the second expansion will contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term? \n\nWait, no, that's not exactly right. Because in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is \\(6a^2b^2\\), I need to see what happens when I multiply this by terms from the second expansion. \n\nBut since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), when multiplied by any term from the second expansion, which does involve \\(c\\), the resulting term will have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests that we are only considering the term where the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., the constant term. \n\nWait, no, that's not correct either. Let me clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. But in the entire expression, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term from the second expansion that is a constant (since otherwise, you'd have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something like that). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the constant term in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nTo find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can again use the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term: \\(c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\), so \\(m = 3\\). \n\nTherefore, the constant term is the term when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the constant term in the second expansion is 20. \n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first expansion and the constant term from the second expansion. That is, 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. \n\nWait, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. \n\nIs there another way to think about this? Maybe by considering the entire product and how terms combine. Let me try that. \n\nSo, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nNow, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that corresponds to \\(k = 2\\) in the first expansion, as we found before. So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, when this term is multiplied by terms from the second expansion, it's multiplied by \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nBut since we want the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero. So, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) which, as before, gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the term from the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nI think that makes sense. Let me just check if I considered all possible contributions. Could there be any other terms in the product that result in \\(a^2b^2\\) without involving \\(c\\)? \n\nWell, if I take a term from the first expansion, say \\(a^3b\\), and multiply it by a term from the second expansion that has \\(c^{-1}\\), that would give me \\(a^3b c^{-1}\\), which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\). Similarly, taking a term like \\(a b^3\\) and multiplying by \\(c^1\\) would give \\(a b^3 c\\), which also isn't \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion. \n\nTherefore, I think my earlier conclusion is correct. The coefficient is 120. \n\nWait, just to be thorough, let me consider the entire expansion. So, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). And \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expands to \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\). \n\nSo, when I multiply these two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, \\(6a^2b^2 \\times c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 6c^4\\), \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 15c^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20\\), and so on. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, that's \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20\\), which gives \\(120a^2b^2\\). All other terms would have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), so they wouldn't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) alone. \n\nTherefore, yes, 120 is the correct coefficient. \n\nI think I've considered this from multiple angles now, and each time I come back to 120. So, I feel confident that 120 is the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so looking at \\((a + b)^4\\), if I expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. So, I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, let me compute the coefficient for that term. \n\nThe coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). I remember that \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!}\\). Calculating that, 4! is 24, and 2! is 2, so it's 24 divided by (2 times 2), which is 24/4 = 6. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider this part as well, but wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which are variables in the first part. The second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so maybe these don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because they are different variables. \n\nLet me think. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), perhaps the coefficient remains the same as in the first part. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product, so maybe the coefficients are multiplied together. Hmm, no, actually, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) in the second part will multiply the coefficients but won't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). \n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Let me clarify. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when we multiply it by any term from the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\), but the coefficient will be multiplied by the coefficients from the second part. \n\nBut hold on, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the entire product, all the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\), will have their coefficients added together. \n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expression, each term contributes a coefficient that gets multiplied by 6 (the coefficient from \\(a^2b^2\\)), and then all those are added together. \n\nWait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. Each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6 in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, each of which has its own coefficient. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any term in the second part would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. \n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product. However, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut is that correct? Let me think. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself in the entire product is zero because \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't multiplied by a term that has \\(c^0\\). Wait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term that has \\(c^0\\), which is 1, you get \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1\\), so that term would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but does \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) have a term with \\(c^0\\)? Let's check. Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will have terms of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, to get \\(c^0\\), we need \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). \n\nSo, the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. \n\nTherefore, when we multiply the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6 from the first part by the term with \\(c^0\\) which has coefficient 20 from the second part, we get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. \n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Let me make sure I'm not missing something. Alternatively, maybe I should think of the entire product as a multiplication of two separate expansions, and when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each expansion where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and the exponents of \\(c\\) are 0. \n\nWait, that's what I just did. So, the coefficient is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), giving 120. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of the entire product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and consider that the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But wait, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 would be 384. But that can't be right because that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384, which seems too high. \n\nWait, but that approach is wrong because when you set \\(c = 1\\), you get the sum of all coefficients, but in reality, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the term where \\(c^0\\) is present, not all terms. So, I think my initial approach was correct, that the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nWait, let me confirm. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. Then, when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has a term with \\(c^0\\) and coefficient 20, so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by that term, you get \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2\\). Any other terms from the second expansion would introduce \\(c\\) terms, so they wouldn't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms. So, only the term where \\(c^0\\) is present in the second expansion affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\), so \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, which is correct. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(c^0\\) is when \\(k = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20, which is correct. So, 6 times 20 is 120. \n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and the exponents of \\(c\\) are 0. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, their exponents are determined there, and \\(c\\) is only in the second part, so the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and \\(c^0\\) from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nSo, I think I've worked it out correctly. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) includes a term with \\(c^0\\) when \\(k = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nSo, for \\((a + b)^4\\), expanding this would give me terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). Each term has a coefficient from the binomial coefficients. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), right? Because when \\(k = 2\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^{2}b^{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the expression also has another part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Wait, but \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\) are separate variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of the second part? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So when you multiply these two, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are different variables, the terms \\(a^2b^2\\) and \\(c^k\\) (for any \\(k\\)) are independent. That means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that seems odd because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems complicated because the second part has multiple terms. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of the first part, ignoring the second part. But that seems unlikely because the second part is part of the product. So maybe I'm supposed to consider that the product of the two expansions will have terms where each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. But since the variables are different, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, right?\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have two polynomials, say P(a, b) and Q(c), then the product P(a, b) * Q(c) would have terms where each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) multiplied by the entire Q(c). But since Q(c) is a polynomial in c, and we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve c, the coefficient would just be 6 times Q(c) evaluated as a polynomial. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because Q(c) is a function of c, not a number.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach it differently. Let me expand both parts separately and then see how they combine.\n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\). As I did before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nNow, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, this is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times a power of c, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms, the c terms don't affect the coefficient. Wait, but that's not quite right because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), but the c terms are separate variables, so actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.\n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check that again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then when I multiply them, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is 6 \\(a^2b^2\\), and it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Since the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, then 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the entire product's expansion would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various k, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms. So, in that case, yes, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is a distraction because c is a different variable. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes the second part. So, probably the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, let me confirm by another approach. Let me consider that the entire expression is the product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the other polynomial to get the coefficient for that term in the product.\n\nSo, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should compute the entire expansion, but that would be too time-consuming. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two polynomials, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second polynomial, which is indeed 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64. To find the sum of coefficients, we set \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a sum of terms involving c and 1/c. So, when I multiply 6a^2b^2 by each term in the second expansion, each term is a coefficient times some power of c. So, in the product, the term 6a^2b^2 will be multiplied by each of these terms, resulting in terms like 6 * [coefficient] * a^2b^2 * c^k. So, the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Considering \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results**:\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of the coefficients in the second part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a constant with respect to \\(c\\), when we multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient is just 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? That doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a numerical value, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) could be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but we're just interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of what power of \\(c\\) it's multiplied by. Hmm, that's possible. But I'm not sure if that's the case. \n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression. \n\nWait, maybe I'm supposed to consider the entire expression as a product, and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. Because if I just take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be multiplied by all the terms in the second expansion, which include various powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the constant term in \\(c\\). \n\nThat makes more sense. So, the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. \n\nOkay, so let's work on finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, this expansion would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. \n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Since these two parts are multiplied together in the original expression, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) (which is just \\(a^2b^2\\)) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives a coefficient of 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives a constant term of 20. Multiplying these together gives 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. \n\nI think that makes sense. Let me recap: \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and find the constant term, which is 20.\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together because the terms are multiplied in the original expression.\n4. The result is 120, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression.\n\nYeah, that seems correct. I don't think I missed anything here. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion is given by \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Setting \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), we find \\(k = 3\\). The constant term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nFinally, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so for \\((a + b)^4\\), applying the binomial theorem, each term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. Now, I'm specifically looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so that would be \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to find the term where \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, plugging in \\(k = 2\\), the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). \n\nWait, let me make sure. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the problem isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider both parts together. But since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I can just consider the part from \\((a + b)^4\\) and then see how it interacts with the other expression. \n\nLet me think. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), I think the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second. \n\nWait, no, actually, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, maybe the coefficient remains the same. That is, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product will have the same coefficient as in \\((a + b)^4\\) because when you multiply by the other expression, you're just adding more terms but not affecting the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) part. \n\nWait, but that seems a bit off. Let me check again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then when I expand it, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and those terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), they just contribute a scalar multiple. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, I need to find the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). How do I do that? Well, the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times 64. As we found earlier, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, so 6 times 64 is 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and I multiply it by each term from the second part, each of those products will have \\(a^2b^2\\) as a factor, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. \n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts are independent of the \\(c\\) parts, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part, which as a scalar multiple is 64. So, 6 times 64 is 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps it's sufficient to consider only the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply by the entire expansion of the second part, which as a scalar is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if I were to expand both parts and look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would indeed be 6 times 64, so 384. \n\nWait, but let me check with another approach. Maybe I can consider the entire expression and see how the terms combine. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives me terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). Each of these terms is then multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can ignore all other terms from \\((a + b)^4\\) except for the \\(6a^2b^2\\) term. Then, when we multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each of those products will have \\(a^2b^2\\) as a factor, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. \n\nSo, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me calculate the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) again. As I did before, setting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, I can think about expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. Each term would be \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The sum of all coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\), which again gives 2^6 = 64. \n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me consider another perspective. Suppose I have the product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in \\(c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial because the second polynomial doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) variables. \n\nSo, in this case, the first polynomial's \\(a^2b^2\\) coefficient is 6, and the second polynomial's sum of coefficients is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if I were to write the entire expansion, it would be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\left(\\sum_{i=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{i}a^{4 - i}b^i\\right) \\left(\\sum_{j=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{j}c^{6 - j}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^j\\right)\n\\]\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=0}^4 \\sum_{j=0}^6 \\dbinom{4}{i}\\dbinom{6}{j} a^{4 - i}b^i c^{6 - 2j}\n\\]\n\nNow, we're looking for the coefficient where \\(a^{4 - i}b^i\\) is \\(a^2b^2\\), so \\(4 - i = 2\\) and \\(i = 2\\). So, \\(i = 2\\), and the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). \n\nFor the second part, \\(c^{6 - 2j}\\), since we're not concerned with the exponent of \\(c\\), we just need the coefficient from the second polynomial, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{j}\\), summed over all \\(j\\) from 0 to 6. But as we determined earlier, the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{j}\\) from \\(j = 0\\) to 6 is \\(2^6 = 64\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 * 64 = 384\\). \n\nI think that's solid. I've checked it multiple ways, and each time I get 384. So, I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem**:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), giving the coefficient:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Sum the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   The sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients**:\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer**: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."
