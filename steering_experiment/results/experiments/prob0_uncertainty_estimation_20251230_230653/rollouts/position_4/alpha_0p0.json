    "text": " \n\nLet me start by looking at the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). If I expand this using the binomial theorem, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. So, the coefficients for each term can be found using the combinations of 4 choose k. \n\nI'm specifically looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That means I need \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) will be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), which implies \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient here would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nNow, the expression also has another part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm not sure if I need to expand this part as well, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables. Wait, but actually, the entire expression is a product of two parts, so maybe the coefficients from both parts will multiply together. Hmm, let me think.\n\nWait, no, actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the second part, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). So, when I multiply the two expansions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms won't affect it. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as in the first part, which is 6. But wait, that doesn't seem right because the second part is also being multiplied. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, no, actually, no, because \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all different variables, so when you multiply the two expansions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the exponent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, that can't be right because then the coefficient would be a sum over all the terms in the second expansion. Hmm, I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about it differently. Let me denote the first part as \\( (a + b)^4 \\) and the second part as \\( \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\). When I multiply these two, the result is the product of their expansions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the \\(c\\) terms would just add factors to the coefficient, but the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) remain the same regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that can't be right because \\(c\\) is a separate variable, so when you multiply, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part. But that seems odd because the second part is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the entire expansion of the second part, but that doesn't make sense because the expansion of the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), and we're looking for a coefficient in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. But since \\(c\\) and \\(a\\), \\(b\\) are separate, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that can't be, because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. That would make sense because then we're looking for a specific term where \\(c\\) cancels out. Hmm, that might be it. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the same as \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), so the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would require considering the \\(c\\) terms as well, but only the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from both parts where the exponents add up to zero for \\(c\\). So, let me try that approach.\n\nFirst, from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier.\n\nNow, from the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. Because when I multiply the two parts, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. But we're interested in the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so that the overall term is \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do this, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\), which simplifies to \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20.\n\nNow, since the entire expression is the product of the two expansions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) (which is just \\(a^2b^2\\)) is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, that's 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product equal to the product of the coefficients from each part? Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of coefficients from each polynomial whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first polynomial and \\(c^0\\) is only present in the second, their product would indeed be the product of their coefficients. So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^m}\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe are looking for the term where \\(a^{2}b^{2}\\), which implies \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and from the first part, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for the second part, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient from the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the term is \\(6 \\times 20 \\times a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120 \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let's go through it again.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\): the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\), so coefficient is 6.\n\nSecond, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\): the term where \\(c^0\\) is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), coefficient is 20.\n\nMultiplying these together: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), giving the coefficient:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), giving \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I should find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That means I need to find the value of \\(k\\) such that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, substituting \\(k = 2\\) into the binomial coefficient, we get \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). \n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nWait, but the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider both parts. But hold on, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), right? So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not any terms involving \\(c\\), I think I can consider the coefficient separately. That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not quite right because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. \n\nBut in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it will become \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that it's looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, that might not be the case. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" \n\nHmm, so actually, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when multiplied by the other expression, it would just be \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not correct either because each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, does that mean they just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, or do they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some specific power of \\(c\\)? Hmm, the way the problem is phrased, it's a bit ambiguous. But I think, given that \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), and the entire expression includes \\(c\\) terms, maybe they're asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would actually be a sum of coefficients from the second expansion. \n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when I expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear in the product as \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(15a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(20a^2b^2\\), \\(15a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, looking at the terms I just listed, the only term with \\(c^0\\) is \\(20a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 20 times the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we found earlier to be 6. \n\nWait, no, hold on. That doesn't seem right. Let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, no, that's not correct either. Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. So, in this case, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to find all combinations where in \\((a + b)^4\\) we have \\(a^2b^2\\) and in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) we have \\(c^0\\), because \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0 = a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nTherefore, I need to compute two things: \n\n1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we've already found to be 6.\n\n2. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nLet me work on the second part now. To find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. \n\nExpanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it's equal to \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. \n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we just found: 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) and 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. When you multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part gets multiplied by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second part, resulting in \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nIs there any other term that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product? Let me think. For example, could there be a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) that, when multiplied by a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), results in \\(a^2b^2\\)? But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and \\(c^0\\) from the second part. So, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n\nWait a second, another thought: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one polynomial and \\(c\\) is in the other, the exponents don't interfere with each other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the product of the coefficients from each part, as I thought earlier. \n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

So, I think I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion. \n\nLet me recall the binomial theorem again. The general term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I want the term where the exponent of \\(a\\) is 2, so \\(4 - k = 2\\), which means \\(k = 2\\).

So, I need to consider the entire expression: \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nHmm, so the coefficient I found earlier, 6, is part of the first part of the product. The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is also a binomial expression. I wonder if I need to expand this as well or if I can just consider the coefficient from the first part because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). \n\nLet me think. Since the second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), and the first part is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), when I multiply them together, the terms from each expansion will multiply term by term. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the only way the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part by any term from the second part. However, since the second part doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. \n\nWait, no, actually, that's not quite right. Because the second part is being multiplied as a whole, not term by term with each term in the first expansion. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, effectively creating multiple terms with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, no, actually, if I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then I need to consider all the terms in the product that result in \\(a^2b^2\\). But since the second part doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), multiplying it by \\(a^2b^2\\) will just give \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like it would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the original problem is asking for a coefficient, not a polynomial. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. \n\nWait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, so perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem doesn't specify a particular power of \\(c\\). So, maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). \n\nIn that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all terms, so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right either because the sum of coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\), so the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a single coefficient. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That would make sense because then we're looking for a specific term. \n\nIf that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, first, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Then, from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. \n\nTo find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). \n\nSo, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 * 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. \n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying \\(c\\). So, does that mean it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\)? If so, then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But that doesn't seem right because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, and it should be \\((a + b + c)^4\\) or something similar, but as it stands, it's \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Since the product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), as I thought earlier. \n\nIf that's the case, then the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120, as I calculated before. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is written differently, and the variables are all independent, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest is separate. But that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product. \n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that when multiplying two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each factor. But in this case, since \\((a + b)^4\\) has the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has multiple terms, each of which is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nTherefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(6 a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6 a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., depending on the term. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. \n\nBut if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nGiven that the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying \\(c\\), it's ambiguous. However, in many algebra problems, when multiple variables are present and a specific term is asked for, it's often implied that the coefficient is taken with respect to all variables, but in this case, since \\(c\\) is in the other factor, it's unclear. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient is usually a number, not an expression. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c)^4\\), but as it is, I have to work with \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nGiven that, perhaps the intended answer is 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is when \\(c = 1\\), so the sum is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. \n\nWait, let me check. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms up to \\(a^4\\) and \\(b^4\\). Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to terms with \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when I multiply, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. \n\nBut the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by all the terms from the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6 a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6 a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times a polynomial. \n\nBut that seems unlikely. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nGiven that, I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\). Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a single number. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c)^4\\), but as it stands, it's \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, maybe I should think of it differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), so unless the problem is asking for the coefficient as a polynomial, which seems unlikely, I think the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but I'm not sure. \n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that when you have multiple variables, the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) would include all the coefficients from the other variables. So, in this case, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient is usually a scalar. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when the entire expression is expanded, but considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times a polynomial. \n\nBut that seems complicated, and I don't think that's what the problem is asking. I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nWait, let me check that again. If I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, multiplying them together gives 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. Therefore, I think that's the answer the problem is looking for. \n\nSo, to summarize, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 120, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the general term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(a\\) is 2, so \\(4 - k = 2\\) which gives \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Find the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) which gives \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nMultiplying these coefficients together gives the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression:\n\\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So that would be \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me write down the general term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). It should be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I need the term where \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2\\). \n\nCalculating the binomial coefficient, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So I need to consider that as well. However, the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\). That means, regardless of the terms involving \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not any specific term involving \\(c\\), maybe I don't need to compute the entire expansion of the second part. \n\nWait, actually, no. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of the two expressions. So that means when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to consider all possible ways to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. But hold on, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), so when I multiply the two expressions, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit confusing because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, so maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, actually, the expression is a product of two separate binomial expansions. So when you multiply them together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So that means, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every possible term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^5 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c}\\), and so on down to \\(\\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\). \n\nBut since the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not any specific term involving \\(c\\), I think that the coefficient will just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, which suggests that perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so we have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which is a bit ambiguous. It could mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), or it could mean the coefficient when considering all terms together, but that doesn't make much sense because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually part of a larger expression where \\(c\\) is being treated as a variable, but the question is only about the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, regardless of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the sum of all coefficients would be obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which would give \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So then, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in the expansion of this product, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nNow, we are interested in the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so that means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and the corresponding binomial coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for each such term, we also have \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum over all possible \\(m\\) values. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because each term in the product will have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), because for each \\(m\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for all \\(m\\), which is 6 * 2^6 = 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high, and I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering only the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, i.e., the constant term. That is, the term where \\(c^{6 - 2m} = c^0\\), which implies \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). In that case, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let's calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), so 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, that makes more sense because if we're looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a constant (i.e., no \\(c\\) terms), then we need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which happens when \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nBut I'm still a bit confused because the problem didn't specify whether it's looking for the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\) terms or just the constant term. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the product would be a sum of terms each multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). But if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, the coefficient would actually be a sum involving \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, implying a single number. \n\nTherefore, the correct interpretation must be that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That is, the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, leaving a constant. So, as I calculated earlier, that term occurs when \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me confirm that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by this, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, giving a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we first determine the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). \n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) occurs when \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nMultiplying these results, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

However, since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not any specific term involving \\(c\\), maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" \n\nOh, I see. It's asking for the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the entire expansion, I need to find all terms where the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared, and then sum up their coefficients. But wait, no, actually, each term in the product will be of the form (something with a and b) times (something with c). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but each of those terms will have different powers of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\). So, perhaps I need to consider that in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make much sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. Perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but since the product is a product of two polynomials, each term in the product will be a term from the first polynomial times a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I just need to find how many times \\(a^2b^2\\) appears in the product, which would be the coefficient from the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. \n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not a numerical coefficient; it's an expression involving \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0, respectively. That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would involve \\(c\\), which is a variable, not a constant. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. \n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's possible that the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I thought earlier, the sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), that is, the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would involve \\(c\\). So, in that case, I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term, and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial. \n\nSo, let's try that approach. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the constant term, we can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. \n\nNow, multiplying the two coefficients together: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times 20 (the constant term) gives 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through it again. \n\nFirst, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). \n\nThen, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) \u21d2 \\(k = 3\\). \n\nTherefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nYes, that seems correct. Alternatively, if I didn't consider the constant term and just multiplied 6 by the entire expansion, the coefficient would involve \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, the correct approach is to find the constant term in the second polynomial and multiply it by the coefficient from the first polynomial. \n\nSo, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{120}"

    "text": " \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. Let me write out the general term for \\((a + b)^4\\). It would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\), right? So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), I need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, substituting \\(k = 2\\) into the binomial coefficient, I get \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the problem is not just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire expression. Hmm, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), so does that mean the coefficient is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is from the other part? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two expressions together, the terms from each will multiply term by term. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find all the terms in the product where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way it can be part of the product is if it's multiplied by a term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, right? Because \\(c^0 = 1\\), so that term would just contribute a constant factor.\n\nSo, in other words, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already found to be 6.\n\nAlright, so let me work on finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem for this expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which means \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when we multiply the two parts together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a term \\(20c^0\\). When we multiply these, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think about the multiplication again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we are only interested in the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, which would change the exponent of \\(c\\) in the term, making it not just \\(a^2b^2\\) but something like \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\). So, we're correct in only considering the \\(c^0\\) term.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nLet me see if there's another way to approach this, maybe by expanding both expressions separately and then multiplying the terms. But that seems more complicated because expanding both expressions fully would take a lot of time. Instead, focusing on the specific terms we need is more efficient.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as a product of two independent binomial expansions. So, each part contributes to the overall coefficient. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only dependent on the first part, and the second part contributes a scalar multiple (because \\(c^0\\) is just a number), it's straightforward to multiply the coefficients.\n\nSo, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying them together gives 120. \n\nI don't see any mistakes in this reasoning. So, I think the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is given by:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we set \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). This gives:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is given by:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which means \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). This gives:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nMultiplying these coefficients together, we get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

I'm looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me calculate the binomial coefficient for that term. \n\nThe binomial coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!}\\). Calculating that, \\(4! = 24\\), and \\(2! = 2\\), so \\(24 / (2*2) = 24 / 4 = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nWait, but the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider both expansions. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). \n\nLet me think about this. When you multiply two expressions, the terms combine. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in another, the variables are independent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second part, maybe the coefficient is just 6 times whatever the entire expansion of the second part is. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is a separate expression. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the second part, when you multiply them together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, no, that can't be right because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second, so if I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not any specific term in \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, but that might not be correct because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second part, because when you multiply, every term from the second part gets multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me double-check. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the second part, when expanded, has terms involving \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, c^0, c^{-2}, c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\). Each of these terms would be multiplied by 6, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times each of these would be 6 times the coefficient of each term in the second part. But if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Wait, looking back at the problem, it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\". So, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me confirm. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 from the first part, and then multiplied by every possible term from the second part, each of which has a coefficient. So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is present only in the first part, and the second part doesn't affect the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But if we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, another way to think about it: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, if we're considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) (i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\)), then we would need to compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and then multiply by 6. Let me check that. \n\nThe expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient there is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, perhaps it's just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But if we're to present it as a single coefficient, that might not make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. \n\nWait, I'm confused now. Let me try to parse the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term will be of the form \\(a^k b^{4 - k} \\times c^m\\), where \\(m\\) can be various exponents. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a single coefficient. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But since the problem didn't specify, maybe I should assume that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, let me think about this differently. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is the product of the coefficient of that term in the first polynomial and the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut if the problem is looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then it would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. Since the problem didn't specify \\(k\\), maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of \\(c\\), which would be 384. \n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). Then, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in \\(6a^2b^2 \\times c^6 + 6a^2b^2 \\times 6c^4 + \\dots + 6a^2b^2 \\times 1/c^6\\). So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 6*6=36, and so on, down to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\) is 6*1=6. \n\nBut if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying the power of \\(c\\), then technically, it's a bit ambiguous because \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero. That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient isn't a single number but a polynomial. \n\nSo, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which, as I calculated earlier, is 20. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, let me confirm that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). To find when the exponent is 0, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, yes, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I think it's more likely that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nWait, maybe I should look back at the problem statement again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's not specifying anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 6 * \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a single coefficient. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient to be a polynomial in \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6\\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem says \"the coefficient\", which is usually a scalar. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is mistyped, and it's supposed to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. \n\nWait, perhaps I can think of it another way. When you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each factor. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would be a polynomial, but since the problem asks for the coefficient, it's probably expecting a scalar, so it's more likely that it's asking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nWait, but let me check the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps it's considering \\(a^2b^2\\) as a term, and the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nWait, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut if that's the case, then the coefficient is 384, but that seems high. Alternatively, if it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 6 * \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would be a polynomial, not a single number. Therefore, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate both possibilities. \n\nFirst possibility: Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which is 6 * sum of coefficients in second part = 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nSecond possibility: Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nSince the problem didn't specify, I'm a bit confused, but I think the more likely answer is 120, because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial, which doesn't make sense as a single coefficient. So, I think the answer is 120. \n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have two polynomials, \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), then the product is \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\). So, each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) times the entire \\(Q(c)\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(Q(c)\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times \\(Q(c)\\), which is a polynomial. \n\nBut if the problem is asking for a single coefficient, it's probably asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nWait, to clarify, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it becomes \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that's a specific term, and that would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nTherefore, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, the answer is 120. \n\nWait, but to make sure, let me calculate \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and see what the constant term is. \n\nAs I did earlier, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The constant term is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nSo, I think that's the correct answer. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), i.e., \\(k = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from both expansions:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nIn this case, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\), so I can expand that using the binomial theorem. Let me write that out. The expansion would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}ab^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}b^4\\). So, if I'm looking for the term with \\(a^2b^2\\), that would be the third term, right? Because the exponents on a and b go down and up by one each time. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). \n\nLet me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, because 4 choose 2 is 6. So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient I just found. \n\nWait, actually, no. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but the entire expression is a product of two parts: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply these two together, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\); it only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply the two expansions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, because there's no overlap in variables. \n\nWait, no, that can't be right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), all those multiplications will just add coefficients for terms that include \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, no. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, does that mean I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and then since the second part is multiplied by it, it's just the coefficient times the entire second expression? \n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because the second expression has multiple terms. So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., up to \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps we're supposed to consider all the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but then sum them up? \n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense either. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so in the entire product, any term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But actually, no, because in the product, each term is a combination of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by any term from the second part. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), does that mean we just take the coefficient from the first part and multiply it by the entire second part? \n\nWait, no, that would give a polynomial, not a single coefficient. I think I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't standard. \n\nSo, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power, meaning it's just 1. So, in that case, I need to find the term in the expansion where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). \n\nSo, to do that, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply those two coefficients together. \n\nOkay, that makes sense. So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can again use the binomial theorem. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). \n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. \n\nNow, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product, we multiply the coefficients from each part. So, 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part) equals 120. \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In the second part, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the entire term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part being multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\) from the second part, which is 1, so the coefficient is just 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " \n\nWait, but the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to find the term in the expansion where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is also squared. Since the exponent is 4, the sum of the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) should be 4. Let me check: \\(2 + 2 = 4\\), so that works. So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\). \n\nCalculating that binomial coefficient: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to figure out how this affects the coefficient. Wait, actually, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the part involving \\(c\\) doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think. \n\nWhen I multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the multiplication by the second expression will just scale the coefficient by the entire sum of the coefficients in the second expression. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. \n\nActually, no, because each term in the second expression is a term involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by, say, \\(c^k\\), we get a term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), I think that the entire coefficient from the second expression will multiply the coefficient from the first expression. \n\nWait, let me clarify. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is a coefficient times \\(a^2b^2\\), and when we multiply it by the second part, which is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), each term in the second part has a coefficient as well. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion will be the product of the coefficients. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), maybe we just need to consider the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion? \n\nWait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. When we multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, the specific term we're interested in is \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, perhaps the question is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, it's considering all possible terms where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, regardless of the \\(c\\) part. \n\nWait, but in the product, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the original coefficient times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, since each term in the second polynomial contributes its own coefficient multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nNow, how do we find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if we set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, in the first part, we have \\((a + b)^4\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of the coefficients is 64. So, when we multiply these two, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient being 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. Since each term in the second polynomial contributes its own coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it just adds up all those contributions to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but is there another way to approach this? Maybe by considering the entire expansion. Let me try expanding both parts. \n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. \n\nNext, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nSo, the coefficients here are the binomial coefficients \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). The sum of these coefficients is when we set \\(c = 1\\), which gives us \\(2^6 = 64\\), as I found earlier. \n\nTherefore, when I multiply the two expansions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is that each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, each of which has a coefficient. So, the total contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nYes, that makes sense. Because when you distribute the multiplication, \\(a^2b^2\\) gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, each contributing their own coefficient, so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all terms in the product is just the product of the two coefficients. \n\nSo, I think 384 is the correct answer. \n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2\\) times \\((c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the first part is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Let's see: \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\). Multiplying them together: \\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\). So, the term \\(a^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), giving \\(a^2c\\) and \\(a^2/c\\). Similarly, the other terms are multiplied. But the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product is 1 * (1 + 1) = 2, which matches. So, this seems to confirm that the method is correct. \n\nTherefore, applying this to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me consider another example. Let's take \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the first part is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the product should be 2. Let's see: \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = a(c + 1/c) + b(c + 1/c) = ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 * (1 + 1) = 2, which is correct. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) is also 2. So, this seems to confirm the method again. \n\nTherefore, I can be confident that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384. \n\nWait, but just to ensure I didn't make any calculation mistakes, let me recalculate the binomial coefficients. \n\nIn the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. That's correct. \n\nIn the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). That's correct. \n\nMultiplying 6 and 64 gives 384. Yep, that seems right. \n\nI think I've thought through this thoroughly and the answer should be 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64.

    "text": " \n\nIn this case, the expression is \\((a + b)^4\\), so \\(n = 4\\). I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would be the term where \\(a^2b^2\\). So, using the binomial theorem, the coefficient for \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\). I want \\(a^2b^2\\), so \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nBut wait, the problem isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire expression. Now, the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but since the entire expression is a product of two parts, I need to make sure that when I multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't get affected by the other part involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). \n\nWait, actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and it gets multiplied by every term in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) as separate variables, but only focusing on the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts. So, the coefficient would actually be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems odd because the question just asks for a coefficient, implying a numerical value.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is considering \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) as separate variables, and it's asking for the coefficient of the term where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, we're looking for all terms in the product where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and then whatever the power of \\(c\\) is, we just include that as part of the coefficient.\n\nBut that seems a bit tricky because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each of which has different powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a sum of terms, each of which is a coefficient from the \\(c\\) expansion multiplied by the 6 from the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) part. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because each term in the product would have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but the problem doesn't specify. Hmm, that's confusing.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the question. Perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. But in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is not a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression, but only looking at the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a numerical value. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the constant term with respect to \\(c\\).\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't specify \\(c^0\\), it just says \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a sum of terms each multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\), which again is a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the coefficient is supposed to be a number, not an expression.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). We need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, when we multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\), each with their own coefficients.\n\nSo, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, it's actually the sum of all the coefficients from the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expansion multiplied by 6. But that would give us a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense as a single coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number.\n\nSo, to clarify, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present and the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). \n\nTo find this, I can proceed as follows:\n\n1. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already found to be 6.\n\n2. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\).\n\nSo, let's tackle the second part: finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nAgain, using the binomial theorem, we can expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\)). Therefore, the final coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6. In the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(c^0\\) has a coefficient of 20. When we multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, including the \\(c^0\\) term. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) will have a coefficient of \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nAlternatively, if the problem was just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But since the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a number, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nTherefore, I believe the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we consider the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\).\n\n1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiply these coefficients: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nLet me focus on the first part of the expression, which is \\((a + b)^4\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part. Using the binomial theorem, the expansion will have terms like \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\). So, if I want the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), that means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me calculate the coefficient for that term. \n\nThe binomial coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). I remember that \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} = \\dfrac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\\), so plugging in the numbers, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire expression, which is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider how this term \\(a^2b^2\\) interacts with the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nLet me think about this. When I multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is only the part involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). That means I might need to consider the entire coefficient from both parts of the expression. \n\nWait, no, actually, maybe not. Let me clarify. The expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand both, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. However, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are different variables, the only term that will contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) is when we take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by any term from the second part. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the other variables, perhaps we need to consider that the coefficient is the product of the coefficients from both expansions, but only for the terms where the variables multiply to \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, no, actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by all the terms in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't seem right because the second part is a separate variable.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I expand both parts separately, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will come from the first part, and it will be multiplied by every term in the second part. However, since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the other variables, that would mean that the coefficient is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those will contribute to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all possible combinations. \n\nWait, but that doesn't sound quite right. Let me think differently. If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what happens with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), then perhaps I can treat the two parts separately. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and the entire second part is multiplied by it, so the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, maybe the question is considering the entire expression as a polynomial in variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, we need to find all terms in the expansion where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and then sum their coefficients, considering all possible exponents of \\(c\\). \n\nBut that seems a bit more involved. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the expression as a product, regardless of the other variables. So, maybe the coefficient is the product of the coefficients from each part, treating them as separate. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let me try another approach. Let's expand both parts separately and then see how they multiply.\n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\). As I did before, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I calculated earlier.\n\nNow, let's look at the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, this expands to:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply the two expansions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6 a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so that would be \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check that again. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in effect, it's the sum of all coefficients that come with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) being 6, and the entire second expansion is multiplied by that, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me think differently. Suppose I consider the entire expression as a product of two polynomials. The first polynomial has terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second has terms involving \\(c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is simply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms.\n\nSo, yes, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with an example. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). The product P(a, b) * Q(c) will have terms where each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of a specific term in P(a, b), say \\(a^2b^2\\), then in the product, that term will be multiplied by every term in Q(c). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) times the sum of all coefficients in Q(c).\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) another way. The sum of coefficients is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), as I did before, which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I could compute the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) by expanding it:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nThe coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for each term. So, the sum of the coefficients is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\nWhich matches what I got before.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have variables, you have to consider cross terms, but in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), their coefficients don't interfere. So, I think my reasoning is correct.\n\nLet me try another approach to confirm. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I were to collect like terms, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, I think the answer is 384.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me compute the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and see what the sum of the coefficients is.\n\nExpanding \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\):\n\n- For \\(k=0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0} c^{6} = 1 \\times c^6\\)\n- \\(k=1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1} c^{4} = 6 c^4\\)\n- \\(k=2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2} c^{2} = 15 c^2\\)\n- \\(k=3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\)\n- \\(k=4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4} c^{-2} = 15 c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(k=5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5} c^{-4} = 6 c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(k=6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6} c^{-6} = 1 c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the coefficients are 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1. Adding them up: 1 + 6 = 7, 7 + 15 = 22, 22 + 20 = 42, 42 + 15 = 57, 57 + 6 = 63, 63 + 1 = 64. So, the sum is indeed 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe by considering the entire expression and looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But since \\(c\\) is a separate variable, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the product of the coefficients from each part, as I thought before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, I think that's correct.

    "text": " \n\nLet me focus on the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). If I expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4. I'm specifically looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which is \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the value of \\(k\\) that gives me \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\) and \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). Solving \\(4 - k = 2\\) gives me \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nWait, what's \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\)? That's 4 choose 2, which is calculated as \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!}\\). Calculating that: 4 factorial is 24, 2 factorial is 2, so 24 divided by (2 times 2) is 24/4, which is 6. So, the coefficient is 6. So far, so good.\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. But wait, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, right? Because the second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply, the variables involved are different. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second part, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, does that mean the coefficient is 6 times whatever the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, so when I multiply, the \\(c\\) terms won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has multiple terms. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, no, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, when you multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all variables, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be, because then it's not a constant coefficient but a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first polynomial, and it is multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. But wait, the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that logic. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part has a coefficient of 6, and when you multiply it by the entire second polynomial, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is indeed found by substituting 1 for all variables, so substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives us the sum of coefficients as \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two polynomials. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present in the first part, and when multiplied by each term in the second part, it will create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from -6 to 6 in steps of 2, I think. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the product would be the same as the coefficient in the first part times the entire second polynomial. So, the coefficient is 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second polynomial) = 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there a possibility that the second polynomial affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), their coefficients shouldn't interfere. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient in the first part times the entire second polynomial. Therefore, 6 times 64 is indeed 384.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

So, does that mean I need to consider the expansion of both parts and then multiply them together? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\).

Therefore, the coefficient should just be 6. \n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I should consider the entire product and look for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, their coefficients aren't affected by \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is indeed just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing something because the problem involves two separate binomial expressions. Let me consider that when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply as well. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's only affected by the first part of the product, \\((a + b)^4\\). So, when you expand the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not right because each term in the product would have the form \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384, which seems too high. But that can't be right because we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6, as I initially thought, because each term in the product would have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) part, it's just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would be 6*(something), but I'm not sure if that's the case.\n\nWait, no, I think I'm confusing the concept here. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's not correct because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply term by term. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that's not quite right either because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a specific power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term becomes \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6*(sum of coefficients). But the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so it's \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6*64 = 384. \n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) power, it's just 6 times the entire second expansion. But that can't be right because the coefficient would then depend on the \\(c\\) terms, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), irrespective of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the answer is just 6. \n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, in other words, when you expand the product, you'll have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, is that correct? Let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not quite accurate because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients don't just multiply; instead, each term in the first polynomial multiplies each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not exactly right because each term in the product would have the form \\(a^{2}b^{2}c^{k}\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not correct because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion, which is 6*(sum of coefficients in the second expansion). \n\nWait, I think the confusion arises because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, every term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of \\(c\\), we can consider that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nTo find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can substitute \\(c = 1\\), which gives us \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but that seems too large. Let me check with a smaller example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The expansion would be \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be \\(c + 1/c\\), and similarly for \\(a^0b^1\\). But if I were to find the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\), it's just \\(c + 1/c\\). However, if I were to consider the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) times any power of \\(c\\), that's different. But in this problem, I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, every term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) will have it multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of \\(c\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64=384. \n\nBut wait, that doesn't seem right because in the smaller example, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which isn't a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the powers of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. That would make more sense. \n\nIf that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. To do that, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply them together. \n\nSo, first, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). \n\nNext, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find this, I can expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nNow, multiplying the two coefficients together, we get \\(6 * 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, so that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. But the original problem didn't specify the power of \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, maybe the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), so the answer is 120. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64=384. But that seems more complicated, and I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient when \\(c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nLet me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in that case, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. \n\nWait, but in the smaller example I did earlier, if I have \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), and I look for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\), it's \\(c + 1/c\\), which is not a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps in the problem, the coefficient is meant to be a numerical coefficient, meaning that the power of \\(c\\) should also be zero. Therefore, the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nI think that's the right way to interpret the problem. So, to recap: \n\n1. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. \n2. Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20. \n3. Multiply them together: 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6*64=384, but that seems less likely because the problem includes \\(c\\) in the expression, so it's probably expecting a numerical coefficient, implying that \\(c\\) is also at the zero power. \n\nSo, I think the correct answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the coefficients from each part of the product:\n\n1. From \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. From \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiply these coefficients: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6.\n\nNow, the expression also has \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to figure out if this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so when I multiply the two expressions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can treat the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part as a constant multiplier for the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're just looking for the coefficient, and not any specific term in \\(c\\), maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms?

But that doesn't make sense because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms from the second expansion. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a single number.

Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but perhaps the problem is only considering terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., where the exponent is zero. Wait, no, the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so I think it's asking for the coefficient in the entire product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\).

So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in that expansion. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a single number. Let me check.\n\nIf that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, i.e., \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, or specifically, the constant term in \\(c\\), then the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to think of the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the problem is phrased as asking for a single coefficient, so I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me consider an alternative approach. Suppose I expand both expressions separately and then multiply them. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) as we saw, and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when I multiply these two, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times 20, which is 120. That seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to expand the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 would be 384, but that's not the case here because we're specifically looking for the constant term in \\(c\\), not the sum of all coefficients. So, I think my initial approach was correct, and the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\), so the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, if I were to multiply 6 by 64, I would get 384, which would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) if we were considering all powers of \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), that would be 384. However, that contradicts my earlier conclusion. So, perhaps I was wrong earlier.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is phrased as asking for the coefficient, which is usually a single number, so maybe I'm misinterpreting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120. That makes sense because it's a specific term.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and since \\(c\\) is another variable, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is phrased as asking for a single coefficient. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Let's think of the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), it would produce terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the \\(c^k\\) terms. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), making it a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a single coefficient, not a polynomial.\n\nTherefore, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial. But that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to be interpreted as finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, that would make the coefficient 6 times 20, which is 120. That seems plausible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial. But that seems odd because the problem is phrased as asking for a single coefficient. Therefore, I think the intended answer is 120, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\).\n\nWait, let me try to compute it another way. Let me expand both parts separately and then multiply the specific terms. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6\\(a^2b^2\\). In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when I multiply these two, I get 6\\(a^2b^2\\) times 20, which is 120\\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120. That makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to consider all possible terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But that would mean the coefficient is 384\\(a^2b^2\\), which seems too large and probably not the intended answer. Therefore, I think the correct approach is to consider only the constant term in \\(c\\), making the coefficient 120.\n\nWait, but to be thorough, let me check the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of coefficients, we set \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, if I were to multiply 6 by 64, I would get 384, which would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) if I were considering all powers of \\(c\\). But that's not what the problem is asking for. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which, in the context of multiple variables, would typically be considering all possible powers of the other variables. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient is a scalar. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to be interpreted as looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, perhaps another way to think about it is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is phrased as asking for a single coefficient. Therefore, I think the intended answer is 120, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\).\n\nWait, let me also consider that the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be 6 times each term, so the coefficient would be a polynomial. But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a single coefficient. Therefore, I think the intended answer is 120, considering the constant term in \\(c\\).\n\nOkay, so to summarize: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 times 20, which is 120. So, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " \n\nSince the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I should focus on the part of the expression that involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), which is \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me expand this first. \n\nUsing the binomial theorem, \\((a + b)^4\\) will have terms like \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\). The term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). That means the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), not \\(c\\). That makes me think that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), because the other part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). \n\nBut let me double-check that. The entire expression is a product of two parts: one involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other involving \\(c\\). When you multiply two expressions, the terms combine by adding exponents. However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would have to contribute a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) either. But \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expands to terms with various powers of \\(c\\), but none of them will have \\(c^0\\) unless the exponent is zero. Wait, does \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) have a constant term?\n\nLet me think. When you expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent on \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). For this exponent to be zero (i.e., a constant term), we need \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. \n\nSo, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to consider the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). We already found that the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the overall coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in the other expansion is 20. Since these are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials. The first polynomial has terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second has terms in \\(c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, their exponents don't interfere with each other. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the constant term in the second polynomial, because any term involving \\(c\\) would change the variables present, but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), we need the part that doesn't change the \\(c\\) exponent, i.e., the constant term.\n\nSo, yes, I think 120 is the correct coefficient. Let me just recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the constant term, which is 20.\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together because they are independent parts of the product expression.\n4. The result is 120.\n\nI don't think I made any errors in the calculations. The binomial coefficients are correct, and the logic about the variables makes sense because each part of the product doesn't affect the other in terms of variable exponents. So, I feel confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part separately. \n\n1. From \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. From \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term (which is the coefficient when \\(c^0\\)) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiplying these coefficients together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{120}"

    "text": " \n\nWait, but the expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's also multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I can treat each part separately and then multiply the results together. That is, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but actually, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part, and the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, maybe I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and then multiply it by the sum of all terms in the second part. \n\nWait, no, that doesn't sound right. Because the entire expression is a product of two expansions, so each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, the second part can contribute any term, but since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), the second part's terms would just be multiplied by 1 in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, maybe I can compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think again. So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a certain coefficient, say \\(C\\). Then, when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion will be multiplied by \\(C a^2b^2\\). But since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), those multiplications by the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be \\(C\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but actually, when we multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is a number, say \\(C\\), and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient will be \\(C\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but is that accurate? Because each term in the second expansion has different powers of \\(c\\), but when we're just considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so perhaps the coefficient would be \\(C\\) times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is simply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion, but since we're only looking for the coefficient, and not the variable part, maybe it's just the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. \n\nWait, but let me think differently. Let me first compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), since \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to choosing 2 a's and 2 b's from 4 terms. So, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nNow, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me compute the sum of the coefficients in this expansion. The sum of the coefficients is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. \n\nTherefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if this makes sense. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that each term in the product is a combination of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first expansion, and when multiplied by any term from the second expansion, it doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the coefficient being 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient, not the variables, it's 6 times 64, which is 384. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the sum of the coefficients in the second part. The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of coefficients, we set \\(c = 1\\), so it becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), which is correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and see if the sum of coefficients is indeed 64. Let's see, the expansion would have terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\), each with coefficients given by the binomial coefficients. So, the sum of the coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which is 2^6 = 64, so that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I feel like I might be missing something. Let me try a different approach. Let me consider the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, so when I multiply it by the second part, it's as if I'm distributing \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a scalar coefficient times \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion, but since we're looking for the coefficient, it's just the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients from the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all the terms in the other polynomial. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6 in the first polynomial, and when you multiply by the second polynomial, each term in the second polynomial is multiplied by 6, so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second polynomial is 6 times each term in the second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the correct approach is to realize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first part times the entire second part, but since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient remains as 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think of the entire expression as a product, and when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\). Wait, that might be a different approach. \n\nWait, because in the product, each term is a combination of a term from the first polynomial and a term from the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), then I need to find all terms in the second polynomial that have \\(c^0\\), because only those terms will result in a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe the coefficient is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, that's a different approach. So, in that case, I would compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is the middle term when the exponent is even. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, to get \\(c^0\\), we need \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nSo, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) times 20 (from the second part), giving 120. Hmm, but that contradicts my earlier result of 384. So, which approach is correct?\n\nWait, now I'm confused. Let me try to clarify.\n\nIn the first approach, I considered that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. But in the second approach, I considered that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120.\n\nWhich one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the first approach. Let me think again.\n\nWhen you have two polynomials multiplied together, say \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\), then the coefficient of a specific term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) times the entire polynomial \\(Q(c)\\). But if you're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), then it's the coefficient from \\(P(a, b)\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(Q(c)\\), because any other power of \\(c\\) would make the term have \\(c\\) in it, which isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but that doesn't sound right because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself (without any \\(c\\)) would only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) in \\(Q(c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be the coefficient from \\(P(a, b)\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(Q(c)\\).\n\nWait, but that contradicts my first approach where I thought it was 6 times 64. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify. Let me consider an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Let's compute the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\), which is just \\(a\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first part is 1. The second part, when expanded, is \\(c + 1/c\\), whose sum of coefficients is 2 (when \\(c = 1\\)), so according to the first approach, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. But let's compute the actual product: \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The terms would be \\(a c\\), \\(a \\cdot 1/c\\), \\(b c\\), and \\(b \\cdot 1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) times \\(c\\) is 1, \\(a \\cdot 1/c\\) is 1, and so on. But if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\) without any \\(c\\), that term doesn't exist because all terms involving \\(a\\) have either \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product is actually 0, not 2. \n\nWait, so that indicates that my first approach was wrong. Instead, the correct approach is to realize that when you multiply by the second polynomial, any term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, but unless the second term is a constant, it won't contribute to the coefficient of the term in the first polynomial without any variables from the second. So, in the example, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product is 0 because there's no constant term in the second polynomial. Wait, but in our original problem, the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which does have a constant term when expanded, specifically when \\(k = 3\\), as I found earlier, giving a coefficient of 20 for \\(c^0\\).\n\nSo, in the example, if the second polynomial had a constant term, say \\((c + 1/c + 1)^1\\), then the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be 1 (from the first part) times 1 (from the constant term in the second part), giving 1. So, that makes sense.\n\nTherefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, giving 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, so that means my initial approach was incorrect when I multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which gave me 384. Instead, the correct approach is to multiply by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, giving 120. So, I must have made a mistake in my first approach.\n\nLet me try to reconcile this. The confusion arises from whether the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire second polynomial or just 6 times the constant term in the second polynomial. From the example, it's clear that it's the latter. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), each with their own coefficients. The only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is when \\(k = 0\\), i.e., the constant term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, so then why did I initially think it was 6 * 64? Because I thought that the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, so when you multiply by that, you get 384. But that approach is wrong because it's not the sum of coefficients, but rather the specific coefficient when \\(c^0\\) that affects the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.\n\nSo, to correct my earlier mistake, the correct coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, let me check this again with the example. Let's say I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first part is 1. The second part, when expanded, is \\(c + 1/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 0 because there's no constant term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product is 1 * 0 = 0, which matches our earlier observation. If the second part had a constant term, say \\(1\\), then the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 1 * 1 = 1.\n\nSimilarly, in our original problem, the second part has a constant term with coefficient 20, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be 120.\n\nWait, but let me compute the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) to confirm the coefficient of \\(c^0\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\cdot \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), which is correct.\n\nSo, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part with coefficient 6, and it's multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, giving 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the initial approach where I considered the sum of coefficients in the second part. When I set \\(c = 1\\), I get 64, which is the sum of all coefficients. But when I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term independent of \\(c\\), I should only consider the constant term in the second part, not the sum of all coefficients. So, the initial approach was incorrect because it multiplied by the sum of all coefficients, which would give the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all powers of \\(c\\), which is not what we want. Instead, we want only the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, so that the product term is just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\). Therefore, the correct approach is to multiply the coefficient from the first part by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, giving 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nThus, after correcting my mistake, I conclude that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). \n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the term with \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nMultiplying these results together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " \n\nThe first part of the expression is \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me expand this using the binomial theorem. So, for each term in the expansion, the coefficient will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4. The general term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I'm specifically looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so that would be \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me find the coefficient for that term.\n\nWhen \\(4 - k = 2\\), that means \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). I remember that \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nNow, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. \n\nWait, actually, let me think again. The entire expression is a product of two expansions: one involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply them together, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the first part, the second part will just contribute a factor that's multiplied by 6. \n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second part is another binomial expansion. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not an expression. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, when you expand the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself, irrespective of the \\(c\\) terms, is just 6 times whatever the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is. But that doesn't seem right either. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is treating \\(c\\) as another variable, and it's only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would just be 6, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. \n\nWait, that seems too straightforward. Let me verify. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by something else, say \\(X\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times \\(X\\). But in this case, \\(X\\) is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is an expansion with multiple terms. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), but the problem statement doesn't specify a particular power of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me check: the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering the entire product, and \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but since it's only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But that doesn't seem right because the second expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), so they don't combine into a single coefficient. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible terms, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would make it a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so that doesn't make sense. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that we're considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would then include all the terms from the second expansion. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the constant term in \\(c\\). That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). That would make more sense because then we're looking for a specific term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. \n\nOkay, so let's re-express the problem: find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That seems more precise. So, first, I'll find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I found earlier. Then, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply those two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). \n\nSo, let's work on the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, so the combined coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through the steps again. \n\n1. Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\): \n   - The general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\).\n   - For \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(4 - k = 2\\) \u21d2 \\(k = 2\\).\n   - Coefficient: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Correct.\n\n2. Coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   - General term: \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n   - Set exponent to 0: \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) \u21d2 \\(k = 3\\).\n   - Coefficient: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Correct.\n\n3. Multiply the two coefficients: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (considering the constant term in \\(c\\)) is 120. \n\nWait, but the original problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't mention anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. \n\nBut in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make it a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so that can't be right. Therefore, the correct interpretation must be that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in \\(c\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 120. \n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me consider another approach. Suppose we consider the entire product as a product of two independent expansions, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so that can't be the case. \n\nTherefore, the only logical conclusion is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We seek the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each expansion:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nAlright, looking at the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), I want to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to find the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, I need \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a^2\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. \n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm not directly asked about this part, but since the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient. Wait, but the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms when looking for \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, maybe I just need to find the coefficient in the first part and then multiply it by the entire second part, but I'm not sure. Let me think more carefully.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all possible terms in the second expression that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), don't change the \\(a^2b^2\\) part. That is, the terms in the second expression should not involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). But wait, the second expression only has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so it doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) at all. So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expression, the \\(a^2b^2\\) part remains, and the coefficient gets multiplied by the entire expansion of the second expression. \n\nWait, no, that can't be right because then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion, but that doesn't make sense because we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would just be 6 times the entire second expression. But that seems off because the second expression has multiple terms. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. Because each term in the second expression is a constant (with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term in the second expression, you just scale the coefficient by that term's coefficient. Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the second expression doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 multiplied by the entire second expression evaluated at \\(c\\) such that it's a constant. But that doesn't seem right either because the second expression is in terms of \\(c\\), and the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), not involving \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, as that would give the total contribution to \\(a^2b^2\\) from all possible terms in the second expression.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(c^0\\) in the second expression. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the term in the second expression that has \\(c^0\\), that's the only term that would result in a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then multiply that by 6.\n\nLet me check that. So, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expression is 20. Therefore, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the first part gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and the second part, when expanded, has a term with \\(c^0\\) which is 20. So when I multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part gets multiplied by 20 from the second part, giving \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). That makes sense because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, but since we're only interested in the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\), we only consider the terms that don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) in the second expression. So, only the constant term (with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)) in the second expression affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. \n\nAlternatively, if I think of the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, but since the second expression is in terms of \\(c\\), and the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), then the only contribution comes from the constant term in the second expression. So, that's 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my reasoning. If I have two separate variables, \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), then when I multiply the two expressions, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term in the second part, which is 6 times 20, so 120.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem, which is 6. Then, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by expanding \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, that would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Calculating the coefficients, I get \\(1a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6. \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That means I have to consider the product of the two expansions. So, I can't just take the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) alone; I need to multiply it by the corresponding terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut hold on, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, right? Because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's only in terms of \\(c\\). So, when I multiply the two expansions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion. \n\nWait, no, actually, I think I might be overcomplicating this. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, that might not be correct either. Let me think again. The entire expression is a product of two independent expressions, so each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, which includes various powers of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nBut actually, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part has a coefficient of 6, and in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term has a coefficient, and when you multiply, you have to consider the product of the coefficients. But since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, the coefficient in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(6a^2b^2 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, actually, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is if the second part contributes a term with \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term. Because \\(c^k \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^k} = c^0 = 1\\). \n\nSo, I think I was wrong earlier. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense because only the constant term from the second expansion would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term to give a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nOkay, so now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the coefficient from the second part, which is 20. Therefore, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120. \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, correct. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when we multiply these two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, giving \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we first determine the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6 using the binomial theorem. Next, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nLet me focus on the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). If I expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\), where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. So, the terms would be:\n\n- When \\(k = 0\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 = 1 \\times a^4 \\times 1 = a^4\\)\n- When \\(k = 1\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 = 4 \\times a^3b\\)\n- When \\(k = 2\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6 \\times a^2b^2\\)\n- When \\(k = 3\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 = 4 \\times ab^3\\)\n- When \\(k = 4\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4 = 1 \\times b^4\\)\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nHmm, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and when I multiply it by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to see how that affects the coefficient. But actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), their coefficients are independent. That is, when I multiply two expressions together, the coefficients multiply as well, but only for terms with the same variables. \n\nWait, but in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests that maybe \\(c\\) terms are somehow involved, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of the other part? But that doesn't make much sense because the coefficient should be a single number, not an expression involving \\(c\\).\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we need to consider how many times \\(a^2b^2\\) appears when multiplied by any term from the second expansion. But actually, \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a single term, so when we multiply it by the entire second expansion, it will create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\) for various \\(k\\). However, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself (without any \\(c\\) terms) would only come from the term where the second expansion has \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, you'd have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), which would make the term have \\(c\\) in it. So, the only way to get a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\) is when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, first, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's work on that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by 20 from the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me check that again. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So when you multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) gets multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply for the same terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there a possibility that other terms in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) could contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? For example, if there was a term with \\(c^k\\) that somehow combined with another term to eliminate the \\(c\\), but no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), so the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion. So, I think my reasoning is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the entire expansion and see if there's another way, but I think the way I approached it is correct. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we need to consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe are looking for the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero). Setting \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), we find \\(m = 3\\). The constant term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each expansion:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."
