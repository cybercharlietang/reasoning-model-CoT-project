If I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then the rest of the expression, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), will just multiply the coefficient by whatever it is. But wait, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe it's just 6 times whatever the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when multiplied by the other part, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) would be the one that doesn't change the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me check that. So, expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem: \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Since these two parts multiply together, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, is that correct? Let me verify. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that when you multiply the two expressions, the terms from each expansion multiply. So, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part, and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But actually, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first part, and the second part has terms involving \\(c\\), the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if it's multiplied by a term from the second part that is \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), which isn't what we're looking for. So, that means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient from the first part times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term from the second part, but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe it's just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the expansion of the second part includes terms with \\(c\\), so if I'm only considering \\(a^2b^2\\), it's only the part where the second factor is 1 (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems right.

When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the \\(c\\) terms don't affect that part. Let me check that. If I look at \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) only involves \\(c\\). So when I multiply them, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\), but since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), I might only need the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because that's the only term that won't have any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factors. Wait, but is there a constant term? Let me check. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). For the term to be constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), we need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by 20, and the \\(c\\) terms will be multiplied by other terms, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, is that right? Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, correct. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, correct. So, when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to find all the ways that \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, that would be when the second term is the constant term, which is 20. So, yes, 6 times 20 is 120. So, the coefficient is 120. I think that's correct.

    "text": " Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\). Wait, but perhaps I do because the entire expression is multiplied together, so maybe there's a cross term. Wait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all, right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a combination of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other part is about \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times whatever the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part would multiply with the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second part to give a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems unlikely because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiplying it by the term in the second part that has \\(c^0\\), because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) term which would make it not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think that's correct. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I found earlier. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, the total coefficient would be 6 multiplied by that coefficient. So, let's work on \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) just 6, and then since it's multiplied by the entire second expression, which includes terms with \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), then the only term that would contribute is when we take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by the constant term from the second part. So, that would be 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I should think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials and look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiplying it by the constant term from the second part. So, yes, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. I think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\nWait, but let me just check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but maybe I should think about the entire expression as a product. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanding this, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get such a term is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and multiplying it by the term in the second expansion that is \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the correct approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, if I consider that \\((a + b)^4\\) has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), and the other part \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a term \\(20c^0\\), then when multiplied together, the term \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20c^0 = 120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 120. That seems consistent.\n\nI think I've checked it enough times. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\n   \\]\n   Simplifying each term:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Now, how do I find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)? Well, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\). So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I'll get the sum of the coefficients. Let's compute that: \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\).

But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like it would result in a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), not involving \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that in the entire product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by every term from the second part. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of the second part. But that can't be right because the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Oh, so maybe they just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(c\\) is separate, the coefficient would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Wait, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is a product, and when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by all terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But no, that doesn't make sense because the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) are not constants; they are coefficients multiplied by powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. Perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we're supposed to treat \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as separate variables. So, when expanding the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present, and its coefficient will be the product of the coefficients from each expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, since we're multiplying by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is another expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression. Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me try to think again. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times whatever the sum is from the other expansion. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because each term in the product is a combination of terms from both expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which would give \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check that again. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 * 64\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. That seems plausible. But I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Alternatively, maybe I should think of the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) would cancel out. Wait, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), it just asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the answer is 6 times the entire expansion, but that can't be because the problem expects a numerical value. Wait, maybe I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6. But that seems unlikely because the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would affect the coefficients. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think differently. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms from each polynomial. But in this case, since we're only looking for a term involving \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other polynomial involves \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes a coefficient, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by each term, the total coefficient is the product of the coefficients. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. That seems to make sense. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded, and each term in that expansion is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from -6 to 6 in steps of 2. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. But let me check this again. Let me consider the entire product. The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a bit more involved. Using the binomial theorem, it's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Now, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion, which has a coefficient of 6, will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean I can ignore the \\(c\\) terms? Or do I need to consider something else? Let me think. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), right? Because the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply these two parts together, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that term will be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me make sure. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6, and I'm multiplying it by every term in the second expression, then the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expression. But the second expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me calculate the sum of its coefficients. The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expression is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second part. But actually, the second part is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term would have a coefficient, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's just 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expression. But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because each term in the second expression has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times that term. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without considering \\(c\\), I think it's correct to consider that each term in the second expression will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expression, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the second expression is multiplied by each term in the first expression, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the second part's entire expansion is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so when multiplied, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6*64=384. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and one in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first polynomial times the sum of the coefficients from the second polynomial, since each term in the second polynomial is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that would be 6 times 64, which is 384. So, I think that's the answer. But let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and when expanded, it's a sum of terms like \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term has a coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) and a power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think each term in the second expansion will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64.

So, when you multiply them, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can treat the other part as a constant multiplier because it doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the terms from the second expansion will just contribute a factor that's multiplied by the coefficient from the first part.

So, when you look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), you're only concerned with the terms where the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that's not exactly right because the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a sum of terms involving different powers of \\(c\\), but when you multiply by \\((a + b)^4\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, when you collect like terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so when you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), you're effectively summing over all possible terms in the second expansion, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, let's compute the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\), because that makes each term equal to its coefficient. So, \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64\\). Let me compute that: \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but is that correct? Let me verify. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), so it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expands to terms involving \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, c^0, c^{-2}, c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\). But since we're multiplying by \\((a + b)^4\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a^2b^2, and when multiplied by each term in the second expansion, it becomes 6a^2b^2 times each term in the second expansion. But when we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we're considering all the terms that result in \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire second expansion's coefficients summed up, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand the product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and when you multiply it by each term in the second part, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. Because every term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so when you collect all the terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\), their coefficients are 6 times each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. So, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it and the answer is simply 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but let me think differently. Suppose I consider the entire expression as the product of two independent expansions. The first expansion is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in terms of \\(c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion, because the second expansion doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part) times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the product of the two expansions, so each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the term in the first expansion, and it's multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should compute the sum of coefficients in the second expansion correctly. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, yes, that part is correct.\n\nWait, but let me check: when \\(c = 1\\), \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the answer is simply 6 because the other part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that doesn't make sense because the entire product would have each term from the first expansion multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, that means every term in the expansion that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should think of it as the product of two polynomials. The first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables are independent, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient, not the entire term, it's 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but let me check another approach. Let's expand both parts separately and see how they multiply.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\) expands to:\n\n\\[\na^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as we found earlier.\n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expands using the binomial theorem as:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\nc^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\n\\]\n\nSo, the sum of the coefficients is 1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), so it's 6 multiplied by the entire second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nYes, that seems correct.

    "text": " Wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe the other part doesn't affect this term? Or does it? Hmm, maybe I need to consider the entire product. Wait, but in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, perhaps the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are multiplied by all the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe we can ignore the other variables because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. Wait, no, actually, the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of what happens with \\(c\\). So, perhaps when we multiply out the two expressions, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can consider that each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Wait, no, that can't be right because that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) depend on the entire second expansion, which it shouldn't. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me see. Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which involves \\(c\\) terms, which are different from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems incorrect because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would then include terms with \\(c\\). Wait, no, I think I'm making a mistake here. Let me try to clarify. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two expressions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is a separate term, and when we multiply it by each term in the second expansion, it will create terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{-k}\\), etc. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think we're supposed to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not correct because each term in the second expansion is a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term, you get different terms, none of which are \\(a^2b^2\\) unless the second term is 1. So, actually, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) remains as \\(a^2b^2\\) is if it's multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, let me find that term. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of the constant term is 20. Therefore, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by this constant term 20, we get \\(20a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 20 times 6, which is 120. Wait, no, hold on. Because in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in the second part, the constant term is 20. So, when we multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by 20, giving a total coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. But wait, is that the only term contributing to \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. Because in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, which includes terms with \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these, you get \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) remains as \\(a^2b^2\\) is if it's multiplied by the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is the constant term 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", but in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all the terms from the second expansion, which have different powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't a single term in the product; instead, it's part of multiple terms, each with different powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that we're considering terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of what happens with \\(c\\). Wait, but in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But that can't be right because the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too high, and I don't think that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that's not possible because each term in the product will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents and \\(c\\) exponents. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that we're summing over all the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for all \\(k\\). But that seems complicated, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the second part, but that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two expressions, each term in the first will be multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which has a coefficient of 6. Then, this term is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each of the terms in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). So, each of these terms has a coefficient that's the product of 6 and the corresponding binomial coefficient from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) would be 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}\\) = 6 * 1 = 6. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) would be 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}\\) = 6 * 6 = 36. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^2\\) would be 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}\\) = 6 * 15 = 90. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (i.e., \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)) would be 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) = 6 * 20 = 120. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\) would be 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}\\) = 6 * 15 = 90. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{-4}\\) would be 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}\\) = 6 * 6 = 36. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\) would be 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}\\) = 6 * 1 = 6. So, each of these terms has a coefficient that's a multiple of 6, depending on the term in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is just one term, the one where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part by the constant term in the second part. So, as I calculated earlier, the constant term in the second part is 20, so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120. I think that's the correct answer. Let me just double-check. The first part gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second part, when expanded, has a constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) with coefficient 20. So, when you multiply these two, you get 6 * 20 = 120 for the term \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms would have additional powers of \\(c\\), so they wouldn't be just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, we find the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives the coefficient as 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

Hmm, perhaps I should think about it more carefully. Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is part of the first expansion, and the second part is multiplied by it. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times whatever the coefficient is for the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you want the other factor to not contribute any \\(c\\) terms, meaning the exponent of \\(c\\) should be zero.

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in the second part), so 6 * 20 = 120.

So, when you multiply two polynomials together, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to see if there are any terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that might affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all, so maybe the coefficient is just 6 times whatever the constant term is in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if the constant term is, say, \\(T\\), then when we multiply by \\(6a^2b^2\\), the coefficient becomes \\(6T a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me figure that out.

The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, right? Because the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part is multiplied by it, but since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, their expansion doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider the entire expansion and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate, their exponents don't interact with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when you multiply two expressions, the variables are independent. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would just come from the product of the corresponding terms in each expansion. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term for any exponent of \\(c\\) would be multiplied by this 6. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\), it should just be 6 times whatever the coefficient is for \\(c^0\\) in the second part, because \\(c^0 = 1\\), which is a constant. So, perhaps I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me check that. Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem: \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).

So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second expansion). So, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Wait, but is that correct? Let me make sure. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and to get the overall term \\(a^2b^2\\), you need to multiply it by the constant term from the second part, which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), then we would have to consider the corresponding term from the second expansion. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), we take the constant term, which is 20, and multiply by 6. So, the coefficient is 120. Let me see if there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the term that's a constant in the second part is 20, so their product is 120. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and when you expand the product, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and any term from the second part will have some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that is, the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a specific term in the first expansion, and when multiplied by the entire second expansion, it would produce terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only come from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) with the constant term in the second expansion, i.e., when \\(k = 0\\). So, that's why we multiply 6 by 20, giving 120. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would have to consider the corresponding term in the second expansion. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), it's only the constant term in the second expansion that contributes. So, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). And for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Then, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply as well. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient for \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, so the combined coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would correspond to all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion, but only the constant term in the second expansion doesn't add any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so that's the only term contributing to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the answer should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for each part separately.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient for this term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Wait, but the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, maybe the part with \\(c\\) doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. So, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), would contribute a term that's multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times whatever the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Because \\(c^0\\) is 1, so it's just the constant term. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me use the binomial theorem again for that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part gets multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives a constant term 20. So, when we multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by 20, so yes, the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's correct.

Hmm, that might be the case. So, perhaps the entire expression is a product of two parts, and I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), because the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6? Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, because the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them together, you get a sum of terms where each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. But since the problem is asking only for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part has only \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms, then any term from the second expansion will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by some power of \\(c\\). But in the final expression, we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that might not be correct. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the entire expansion, the coefficient for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) times any combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms. But since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, because each term in the second expansion will be multiplied by 6 (the coefficient from the first part). Wait, that seems more accurate. Let me think about it. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) which gives me \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which expands to a sum of terms with various powers of \\(c\\). So, when I multiply these two together, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, for example, \\(a^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^4c^6\\), \\(a^4c^4\\), etc. Similarly, \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, giving terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), and so on. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then I would need to sum all the coefficients from the second expansion because each term in the second expansion will contribute to a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe I should approach it differently. Let's think about the entire expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every term in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Since the second part's coefficients sum to 64, as I found earlier, then yes, the total coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, that seems correct. Alternatively, if I were to expand both parts completely and then look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I would have to consider all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. But since the problem doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\)'s power, then yes, it's just 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. Therefore, 6 * 64 is 384. So, I think that's the correct answer. Let me just double-check my reasoning. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 2^6 = 64. So, when you multiply these two expressions together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times any term in the second expression is 6 * 64 = 384. So, yes, that makes sense. I don't think I made any mistakes here.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first part (6) and the sum of the coefficients from the second part (64):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

Let me think: when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), which is a different variable, the coefficients for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the same as in the first part, right? Because when you multiply by something else, it's like scaling the entire expression by that factor, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient remains the same. Wait, but actually, no. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me clarify: The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, because \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, to find the overall coefficient, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). So, first, let me find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do this, I'll use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part has a coefficient of 6, and when multiplied by the 20 from the second part, the overall coefficient becomes \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20. When you multiply these two terms together, you get \\(6 \\times 20 \\times a^2b^2 \\times c^0\\), which is \\(120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Hmm, that seems right. Let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the entire expression is a product, so when you expand both parts separately, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term from the second part, including the constant term (which is \\(c^0\\)). So, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times 20, which is 120. Alternatively, if I thought that the \\(c\\) terms didn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I might have just said 6, but that's not correct because the entire expression is a product, so each term from the first part is multiplied by the entire second part. Wait, no, actually, no. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Wait, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of all products where the term from the first polynomial is \\(a^2b^2\\) and the term from the second polynomial is a constant term.

But that would mean the coefficient isn't just 6; it would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of the entire product, considering all possible terms, but I'm only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) part, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms.

Hmm, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, when you expand the entire product, you'll have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from each term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the \\(c\\) exponents. So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so that would be \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems too high. Wait, maybe I'm not thinking correctly. Let me try another approach. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's compute that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, that makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\), and the coefficient is the product of the two coefficients. So, I think 120 is the correct answer. Let me double-check my steps. First, I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, I needed to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying them together gives 120. Yes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break it down into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from each part:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Wait, maybe I need to consider both expansions together. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe the part with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) doesn't affect that term. Let me think. When you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second. But since the problem is only asking about \\(a^2b^2\\), which only comes from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), might contribute other variables, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the other part can be considered as a constant multiplier. Wait, but no, because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can have multiple terms, but when we multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), it will just get multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would then be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part, but that doesn't make sense because the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it will just be \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps the part involving \\(c\\) doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, because when you multiply, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from the other expansion, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is just one term from the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, but that can't be right because the second part's expansion includes various powers of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps we need to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part, but that seems off. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the second part's expansion might contribute terms that don't involve \\(c\\), but actually, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expands to terms involving \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, 1, c^{-2}, c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\). So, none of these terms are constants except for the middle term, which is when the exponent is zero. Wait, but in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the expansion will have terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is even, from 6 down to -6. So, the only term without \\(c\\) is when the exponent is zero, which is the central term. Let me check that. The general term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). For the exponent to be zero, \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the term without \\(c\\) is when \\(k = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). So, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a constant term of 20, and other terms with positive and negative exponents of \\(c\\). Now, going back to the original problem: the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will have terms where each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term comes only from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and then it's multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that would mean that the coefficient would be \\(6\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient, not an expression in terms of \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be \\(6\\) times each coefficient from the second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) would be 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^4\\) in the second expansion, and so on. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any power of \\(c\\). Hmm, that seems a bit ambiguous. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is \\(6\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because then it's not a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the entire product is a polynomial in \\(a, b, c, 1/c\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which would give \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms, so it's just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. Maybe the problem is expecting me to consider the entire expression and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\). That is, treat \\(c\\) as another variable, and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a bit strange because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second expansion. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a numerical value. So, let me check that. If I take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part, which is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and multiply it by the constant term from the second expansion, which is 20, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). That seems plausible. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. But I'm not sure. Let me think again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{m}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) ranges from -6 to 6, stepping by 2. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present for \\(k = 2\\), and for each \\(m\\), the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{(6 - m)/2}\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me clarify. The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k}a^{k}b^{4 - k}\\). The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when you multiply these two expansions, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{k}b^{4 - k} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so we need to find all terms where \\(k = 2\\) and \\(4 - k = 2\\), which is when \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, for each \\(m\\), the coefficient from the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). So, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) is \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient is the sum of all \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m\\) from 0 to 6? That would be \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). The sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m=0\\) to 6 is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, that seems high. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term, which is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). In that case, the coefficient from the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), so the total coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think about it differently. If I consider the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient, not the term, perhaps it's expecting the coefficient to include all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient is a scalar, not a polynomial. Wait, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, that would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting only the constant term, which would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). I'm not entirely sure, but I think the more reasonable answer is 120 because it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term. Let me verify that. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\) would have each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that seems to contradict my earlier thought. Alternatively, if I set \\(c = 1\\), I get the sum of all coefficients, which is 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But if I don't set \\(c = 1\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is expecting me to treat \\(c\\) as a variable and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion, but that seems odd because the coefficient would then be a polynomial, not a number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term, which is 20, so 6 times 20 is 120. I think that's more likely what the problem is asking because otherwise, the coefficient would be a function of \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense in this context. So, I'll go with 120 as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, considering the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms? Or do I? Wait, no, because the entire expression is multiplied together, so I need to make sure that when I multiply the two expansions, I only take the terms that contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, but actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) won't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, maybe I can treat them separately. That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's just 6 times whatever is needed from the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes only from the first part, because the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, maybe the coefficient is just 6 multiplied by whatever the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is, but that doesn't seem right either. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\) multiplied by \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). So, that would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that means we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as I found earlier. So, the coefficient from the first part is 6, as I calculated. Now, for the \\(c\\) terms, we need to find all possible terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that, when multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, but actually, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms can be anything because they don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Hmm, that seems a bit off. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that might not be correct either because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has different powers of \\(c\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a single term, perhaps it's multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient be 6 * 64 = 384? That seems plausible, but let me verify. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it because the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe the answer is just 6, but that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would affect the overall coefficient. Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient in the product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that sum is 64, as I thought before. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. But wait, let me check that again because maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which would be the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, maybe I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6. Let me try that approach. So, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that makes more sense. I think I was confused earlier because I thought the problem was asking for the coefficient regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but actually, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible exponents of \\(c\\), but since the variables are separate, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient in the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) part, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so when you multiply them, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), you have to consider all possible terms from the second expansion multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient 6 * 64 = 384. However, I think that's not the case because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be paired with any term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient would indeed be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning it's just 6. But that doesn't seem right because the entire expression includes both parts. Wait, let me think again. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\( (1 + 1)^6 = 64 \\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct answer. But let me verify once more to be sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion without considering the \\(c\\) terms, which would just be 6. But that seems unlikely because the entire expression includes both parts. So, considering all that, I think the correct coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64.

So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me figure that out. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be done using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), so 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me double-check. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Hmm, that seems right. Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them together gives 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by considering the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1.

    "text": " Wait, but the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Or do I? Wait, no, because the entire expression is the product of the two expansions. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I might need to consider the entire expansion. But actually, no, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when multiplying, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will come from the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), right? So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. Wait, but if I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then all the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), but since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not right because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a term involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times some term in \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), that would mean we're only interested in the part where the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, i.e., where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a term in \\(c\\) that has \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me figure that out. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the exponent to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients I found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me double-check that. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that means we're looking for the part where the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have multiple variables, you have to consider all possible ways to get the term, but in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, I think 120 is correct. Let me think again: \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives a constant term (c^0) with coefficient 20. So, when you multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that makes sense.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\) in the expansion:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   We look for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   Setting \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) gives \\(m = 3\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients**:\n   Multiply the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Wait, but the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because they're in a different part of the product.

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the other factors (those involving \\(c\\)) don't matter because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. Wait, but the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, so does that mean I just need to find the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Or perhaps, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, their coefficients are independent. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has different powers of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, which is independent of \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems too broad. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the first product, and the second product is separate, when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, and the second part would contribute a factor of 1 because we're not looking for any specific power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, the \\(c\\) terms don't affect that. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you're effectively scaling the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by each coefficient in the second expansion. Therefore, the total coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but how do I find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? The sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), right? Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) into the expression gives the sum of the coefficients. Let me check that: \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, but wait, is that correct? Because each term in the product would be \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) (each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but in terms of coefficients, if you consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by every possible term in the second expansion, but since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, their exponents don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when expanded, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part would be multiplied by every term in the second part, each of which is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part contributes a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it just scales it by that coefficient. So, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try another approach. The expression is a product of two separate binomial expansions. So, when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first binomial times the entire expansion of the second binomial, but since we're only looking for the coefficient, not the variable part, maybe it's just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second binomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first part, and the second part doesn't affect it, so the coefficient would just be 6. But that doesn't seem right because the entire product would include all the terms from both expansions. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. It says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the entire product. So, when you expand the product, each term would be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m c^{-n}\\), but the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), so the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of those of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're just looking for the coefficient, it would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present once, and the rest of the terms involve \\(c\\), so the coefficient would just be 6. But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. So, I think 384 is the correct answer. Let me double-check my steps. 1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). 2. The second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of its coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\). 3. Since each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that seems right. So, the final answer should be 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"
