    "text": " But since the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) because they won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, is that right? Hmm, maybe I should think about it more carefully. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is a constant term, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because when I multiply that constant term by \\(a^2b^2\\), it will still be \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant, so the coefficient will just be the product of 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) and that constant term's coefficient. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me apply the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, I need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), I get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by this constant term 20 from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, does that make sense? Let me check again. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when I multiply these two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. I don't think I missed anything here. So, the coefficient is 120.

    "text": " But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean I don't need to consider the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\)? Wait, no, because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\) don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients? Hmm, maybe. Let me think. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), right? So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product would be the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and some term from the second part. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), maybe the entire second part just contributes a factor that doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the second part is raised to the 6th power, so it's a sum of terms, each with different powers of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all the terms in the second expansion? Wait, no, that can't be right because each term in the second expansion would have different powers of \\(c\\), but since we're only looking for the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, perhaps we just take the coefficient from the first part and multiply it by the entire second expansion, but since the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term's coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, that doesn't seem right either because the second expansion is a separate part, and when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. But since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, and the second expansion doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), then the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire second expansion's value, but that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is a sum of terms. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the first expansion, we can consider that the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. But wait, that might not be correct because the second part is a separate variable. Alternatively, perhaps the entire expression is a product, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire second expansion evaluated at a specific point. Wait, no, that's not right either. Maybe I should consider that the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. Let's do that. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when we multiply this by \\((a + b)^4\\), which has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), the product will have terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) for each \\(m\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can ignore the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that's not possible because the product would have terms involving both \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\). So, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would only come from the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), then the resulting term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the term in the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. That makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term we're interested in. So, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already found to be 6. Now, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that using the binomial theorem. As I wrote earlier, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent is 0, which occurs at \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is 20. Multiplying these together gives 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120. I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe by considering the entire expansion. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I were to expand this, each term in the first expansion would be multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only term that would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) is when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second expansion. So, that's consistent with what I did earlier. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. Yeah, I think that's right.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me check the calculation of the binomial coefficients again. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. Correct. For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Yep, that's correct.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\).

Wait, no, that's not right. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second. But in this case, the first expression is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in terms of \\(c\\). So, actually, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by the entire second expression, which is in terms of \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is in two variables, \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). Wait, no, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire expression, which includes \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe I need to consider all possible terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and see how they interact with the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But wait, no, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would be the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), right? Because when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that's not exactly right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only present in the first part, and the second part doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. So, when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, but the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in this expression would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), because that would make each term equal to its coefficient. So, let me calculate that. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients in the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again. Because in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only present in the first part, and when you multiply by the second part, which has terms in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, as I thought before. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. But wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is that since the two parts are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. Because when you multiply, you want the exponents of \\(c\\) to cancel out, so that you have a term that is just a constant, so that when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get a term \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant. Wait, that makes more sense. Because if you have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then to get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\), you need to multiply by a term in the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term. Because otherwise, you'd have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), which are different terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. That makes more sense. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me calculate that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so 6 - 2k = 0. Solving for k, 6 = 2k, so k = 3. So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that's different from my earlier answer of 384. So, I must have made a mistake in my initial reasoning. Let me clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two expressions together, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression is a single term, and when multiplied by the second expression, it becomes \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, no, that's not correct because the second part has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), which are not the same as \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the only way to get a term that is exactly \\(a^2b^2\\) is if the second factor contributes a term with \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. That makes sense because any other term in the second part would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, making the term not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, as I calculated earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Therefore, the coefficient in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the correct answer. To double-check, let me consider expanding both parts separately. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), has \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\), with coefficients given by the binomial coefficients. The constant term, as we found, is 20. So, when we multiply the first part by the second part, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), ..., down to \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only be the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think I was correct in my second approach. My initial mistake was thinking that the entire sum of coefficients in the second part is what matters, but actually, only the constant term contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

When you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the second part, \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that corresponds to \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as I thought earlier. So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\). But since the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, but that can't be right because if we're just looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), summed up. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand this product, each term will be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the term in \\((a + b)^4\\) where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs, which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). Now, this term is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As I thought earlier, the sum of coefficients is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but that seems correct? Let me see another way. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but the problem doesn't specify, it just says \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in that case, yes, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the problem. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire product is a polynomial where each term is a product of a term from each factor. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all possible coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) multiplied by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that sum would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64=384. So, I think that's the answer. Alternatively, maybe I can compute the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and then multiply each term by 6 and see if the total is 384. Let's see, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as \\(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\cdot (1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{0} = 1\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{1} = 6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{2} = 15\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{4} = 15\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{5} = 6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{6} = 1\\). So, the sum of these coefficients is 1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64, which matches what I found earlier by setting \\(c = 1\\). Therefore, multiplying this sum by 6 gives 6*64 = 384. So, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms when looking for \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, actually, the entire expression is a product of two parts: one involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since the problem is only asking about \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the \\(c\\) terms don't affect that coefficient. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by whatever the coefficient is for the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that correct? Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then in the product, the terms from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and when I multiply this by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), that term will have some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think I need to consider all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and sum their coefficients, because each will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, no, that might not be right. Let me think again. When you have two separate expressions multiplied together, the coefficients for specific terms in the product are found by multiplying the coefficients of the terms in each part that combine to give that specific term. So, in this case, I'm looking for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) only come from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), will contribute a term that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that correct? Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by each term in \\((a + b)^4\\), so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms can be anything because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), if we set \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (from the second part), giving 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me check another way. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first polynomial, so the second polynomial contributes a scalar factor to each term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second part, because the second part doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, yes, I think that's right. So, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to look at it is to consider that \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) are being multiplied, so each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is 6a^2b^2, and when you multiply this by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like 6a^2b^2 * (some term involving c). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms, that would mean that each of these products contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the overall expression. Wait, but that can't be right because each term in the second expansion is a different power of c, so when you multiply 6a^2b^2 by each term, you get different terms, each with different powers of c, but all with the same \\(a^2b^2\\) part. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient times \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire product being the sum over all possible products of terms from each expansion. So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), you have to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and multiply it by every term from the second expansion. Each of these products will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some term involving c, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms, each of these products contributes to the coefficient. Therefore, the total coefficient is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Since the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, as we found before, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that makes sense. So, I think the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but maybe I should double-check the sum of coefficients in the second expansion. The second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of coefficients, we set \\(c = 1\\), so it becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), which is correct. So, that part is right. And the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is indeed 6. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, okay, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but another thought: when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients add up if the variables match. But in this case, the variables in the two expressions are different: one has \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the other has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables are all distinct, so the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expression and multiply it by any term from the second expression. But since the second expression doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first expression multiplied by the entire second expression. Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in c. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering c. So, maybe the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, but that seems unlikely because the entire expression is the product of both parts. So, I think 384 is the right answer.\n\nWait, let me try another approach. Let's consider the entire expansion. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we're interested in the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\), so that means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\), the total coefficient will be the sum over all possible \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Because for each \\(m\\), we have a term \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\), and when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), it contributes \\(6\\dbinom{6}{m}a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(6\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, that confirms my earlier answer.\n\nWait, but let me check: is the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) equal to \\(2^6\\)? Yes, because the sum of the binomial coefficients for a given \\(n\\) is \\(2^n\\). So, that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 384.\n\nSo, after going through this step by step, I'm confident that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Wait, but no, that's not correct because the \\(c\\) terms are separate variables. So, actually, when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps the coefficient is just 6, because each term in the \\(c\\) expansion is just a scalar multiplier. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the \\(c\\) terms could have their own coefficients. Wait, no, actually, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression in terms of \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, they're treating \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as separate variables, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a number. But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Wait, no, the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so perhaps it's considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but perhaps the problem wants the numerical coefficient when considering all possible \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression as a product, so that the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that might be it. Because if you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6, and then when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, that seems plausible, but let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the \\(c\\) terms are separate, so maybe the answer is 6. But that seems too simple, and I think the problem is expecting a more involved answer. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the coefficient is just 6 because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. Wait, but when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, if I have \\( (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\) and \\( \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m} \\). So, when you multiply these two, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first polynomial, which is 6, times the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. But the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient being 6, and the \\(c\\) terms are separate, so perhaps the answer is 6, but I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the \\(c\\) polynomial, which is 64, so 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Let me verify this another way. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but if the problem is asking for the coefficient as a numerical value, perhaps it's considering the constant term or something else. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient in terms of \\(c\\), but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6, but that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the answer is indeed 6. Wait, let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each factor. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) only comes from the first factor, \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every term in the second factor, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to consider the coefficient in the expanded form, treating all variables as separate, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense for a single numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and ignoring the \\(c\\) parts, so the coefficient is just 6. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. But that's not what's stated. Hmm, perhaps I should look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.

Wait, perhaps I should check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's only specifying \\(a^2b^2\\), not any specific power of \\(c\\).

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. But that seems inconsistent with the way the problem is phrased. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expanded form, which would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Therefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and since the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is multiplied by 1, the coefficient remains 6. But that seems too simple, and I think the problem is expecting a more involved answer. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would involve considering all possible terms from the \\(c\\) expansion, but since the problem doesn't specify any \\(c\\) exponent, perhaps the answer is 6. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be the constant term. So, let me try that approach. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so 6 - 2m = 0, which gives m = 3. So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in the \\(c\\) expansion would be 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it would be 6 times the entire expansion, but that doesn't make sense as a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is 120, considering the constant term. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 64, so 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would be 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Hmm, I'm a bit confused now.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient to be 6 times the entire expansion, which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Wait, perhaps I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) being 6, and the \\(c\\) terms are just multiplied by that, so the coefficient remains 6. But that seems inconsistent with the way polynomial multiplication works. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to multiply the coefficients, so 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 (polynomial), but that doesn't make sense as a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as 6, and the \\(c\\) terms are separate, so the answer is 6. But that seems too simple, and I think the problem is expecting a more involved answer. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6, and the \\(c\\) terms are just part of the expression, so the coefficient remains 6. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 64, so 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Hmm, I'm not sure. Let me think again. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, it's considering the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is raised to any power. So, in other words, it's the sum of all terms in the product where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, which suggests that perhaps it's considering the coefficient as a polynomial in \\(c\\), but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as 6, and the \\(c\\) terms are separate, so the answer is 6. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 64, so 384. But I'm not sure. Wait, perhaps I should check an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it's (a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c. The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is c + 1/c, and the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) is also c + 1/c. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is c + 1/c, which is a polynomial. Therefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, which suggests that perhaps the answer is 6.

    "text": " But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Wait, but actually, the entire expression is a product of two parts: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), right? Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, no, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot (1/c)^k\\), etc. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that we need to consider all the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out, so that the term is just a constant multiple of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, is that correct? Or is it that the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms? Hmm, I'm a bit confused now. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps they just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what happens with \\(c\\). But that seems a bit odd because the entire expression is a product, so each term would have some combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient would include all the terms from the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expansion. Hmm, but that might not be the case. Alternatively, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression, which would involve combining terms with the same powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), but varying powers of \\(c\\). Wait, but in that case, the coefficient would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make much sense. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. Perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, without considering the \\(c\\) terms. That is, treating the entire expression as a product, and looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) multiplied by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\). Wait, but that might not be correct either. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out to zero. That would make sense because then the term would just be a constant multiple of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. Let me try that approach. So, first, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), because when I multiply it by \\(a^2b^2\\), I want the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, since the two expansions are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), which gives 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20. When you multiply these together, the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would have a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. So, yes, that makes sense. Alternatively, if I were to expand the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by all the terms from the second expansion, but only the term where \\(c^0\\) would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. All other terms would have some power of \\(c\\), so they wouldn't be purely \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think 120 is the correct coefficient. Therefore, the answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " But wait, the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe the part involving \\(c\\) doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) expanded and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expanded, each term in the first will multiply each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), maybe the \\(c\\) terms just get multiplied by 1 in the coefficient? Or perhaps the entire second expression is a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, no, the second expression is in terms of \\(c\\), so when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems complicated because the second part is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, maybe the coefficient is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be a sum of terms, each of which would multiply the terms from \\((a + b)^4\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all terms in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that can't be, because then the coefficient would be a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), which isn't a constant. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, perhaps the expression is a product, and we need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a sum over all the terms in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each multiplied by 6. That doesn't make sense because then the coefficient would involve \\(c\\) terms. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that can't be right because the coefficient should be a constant, not a function of \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering that the entire expression is a product, so each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, the coefficients from the \\(c\\) part would just be summed up. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me check. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, when you multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is another expansion, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is just a scalar multiple for that term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I thought earlier, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient would be 384. Wait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., the constant term. Because if you have \\(c^k \\times c^{-k}\\), that would be 1, but I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". It doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so I think it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, regardless of \\(m\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). So, that would be 6 * (sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for m from 0 to 6). The sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from m=0 to 6 is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me check with a different approach. Let me compute the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) first. Using the binomial theorem, it's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when we multiply this by \\((a + b)^4\\), which has a term \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\), the entire coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the \\(c\\) expansion is multiplied by 6a^2b^2. But the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion is when we set \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

Wait, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply as well. So, if I have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\), which has a coefficient of 6, and then I multiply it by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then each of those terms will be multiplied by 6. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that the coefficients from the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me correct myself. The expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(a^k b^{4 - k} \\times c^m (1/c)^{6 - m}\\), which simplifies to \\(a^k b^{4 - k} c^{m - (6 - m)} = a^k b^{4 - k} c^{2m - 6}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\) and \\(4 - k = 2\\). So, that term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. Now, when we multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion will be multiplied by 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not quite right. Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a term like \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\). So, when we multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term becomes \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not correct because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me check my reasoning again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), perhaps I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms at all. Wait, no, because the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so when you expand it, each term will be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is being multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I calculated earlier, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. But wait, let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, giving 384. But let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). Now, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to terms like \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). So, when I multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times each coefficient in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), summed together. So, 6*(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6*64 = 384. So, that seems correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.

So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But wait, no. Because the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we would have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times each term in the second expansion. But that would result in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without considering the power of \\(c\\), then perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that can't be right because the problem is likely expecting a single numerical coefficient. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that's not correct because the second expansion is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so each term in the second expansion is a separate term when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be 6 times each term in the second expansion, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 36, and so on. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply that it's considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, but that's not how it works. Each term in the product has specific exponents for each variable. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's probably considering the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, but without any restriction on the exponent of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But that's not correct because the second expansion has different powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the product. That makes more sense. So, let me restate the problem: find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That seems more plausible because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial, not a single number. So, assuming that, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, to do that, I can treat the two parts separately. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I calculated earlier. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Once I have both coefficients, I can multiply them together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, multiplying the two coefficients together: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\)) gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 120. So, I think that's the answer. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, I expanded \\((a + b)^4\\) and found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) to be 6. Then, I expanded \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and found the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) to be 20. Multiplying them gives 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, if the problem was just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), which doesn't make much sense because \\(c\\) is part of the expression, but if that's the case, then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would be a polynomial, not a single number. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, I'm confident that the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the two coefficients:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe we can consider that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 multiplied by the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that can't be right because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) isn't a constant. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Oh, maybe the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you multiply out the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but the coefficient for each such term would be the same as the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not correct because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has different coefficients, so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term will have a different coefficient. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. That is, it's considering all possible terms where the product includes \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any combination from the second expression. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that makes sense because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Which is indeed 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but that's not specified. The problem just says \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think it's considering all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem, and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps it's just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a specific term in the second expression. But that doesn't make much sense because the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\). So, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6*64=384. Wait, but let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first polynomial, and the second polynomial is in \\(c\\), the exponents of \\(c\\) don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that's 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, regardless of the other terms. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes the second part.

Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the sum of coefficients is when we set \\(c = 1\\), which is 64, then 6 * 64 = 384. So, is 384 the correct coefficient? Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Maybe I should think differently. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

As I calculated earlier, the sum of coefficients is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. But let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve multiplying the two expressions.

So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by the other expression, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is present with coefficient 6, and it's multiplied by every term in the other expression, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient remains 6. Wait, but that seems conflicting with my earlier thought. Let me think again. If I have two polynomials, say, P(a,b) and Q(c), then the product P(a,b) * Q(c) would have terms where each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in P would be multiplied by each term in Q, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various k. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any k. But in reality, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in P and Q doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in Q, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q. Because each term in Q contributes a factor that multiplies \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in Q is Q evaluated at c=1, which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that's the answer. Wait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and when expanding, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be present in \\((a + b)^4\\) and would be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since the sum of coefficients is 64, as before, then 6 * 64 = 384.

So, in other words, when you expand the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient that includes the product of the coefficients from both expansions. Wait, but no, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). So, when you expand \\((a + b)^4\\), you get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), etc., each multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps the coefficient is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the second part, which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. Hmm, I'm confused now. Let me try to approach it differently. Let's consider the entire expression: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are numerical. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), without considering the other part. But that seems too simple, and the problem includes both parts. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering the multiplication with the other part. But since the other part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression in \\(c\\). Wait, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and since the other part doesn't affect it, the coefficient remains 6. But that seems too straightforward, and the problem includes both parts. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we're supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. Because otherwise, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\), which would make the coefficient not a single number. So, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0, respectively. That would make more sense. Let me assume that the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\) in the entire expression. So, let me proceed under that assumption. So, first, I'll find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I calculated before. Then, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Once I have both coefficients, I can multiply them together to get the final coefficient for the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, let's work on \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem for this. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, since the two parts are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 and 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. Wait, but the original problem didn't specify the \\(c^0\\) part, so maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number. So, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, if I take 6 * 64, that would be 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by other terms. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. I'm a bit confused now. Let me try to clarify. When you have two separate variables, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in one part, and \\(c\\) in the other, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a number. Therefore, I think the problem must have a typo or is missing some part, or perhaps I'm misinterpreting it. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering only the terms where \\(c\\) is raised to the power of 0, which would mean the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would involve \\(c\\), which isn't a coefficient but a term. So, I think the intended question is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120, as I calculated earlier. Therefore, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**  \n   Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**  \n   The term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), giving \\(k = 3\\).

    "text": " But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think about that. When you multiply two expressions together, the coefficients multiply. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) in the second part won't affect the exponent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, and the \\(c\\) terms are multiplied as a whole, maybe the coefficient is just 6 times whatever the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), the coefficient would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that might not be correct. Alternatively, maybe the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial can be found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Which, as I calculated, is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times each coefficient in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would give me a sum of all those products, which would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would involve powers of \\(c\\), which aren't specified. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That would mean the coefficient is 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me check that. So, first, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so 6 - 2m = 0. Solving for m: 6 - 2m = 0 \u21d2 2m = 6 \u21d2 m = 3. So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the constant term is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, that makes more sense because otherwise, if we consider all terms, the coefficient would be 384, but that would involve different powers of \\(c\\), which might not be intended. Since the problem just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any condition on \\(c\\), maybe it's 384. But perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(c\\), so 120. Hmm, I'm a bit confused now. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That would mean that when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all terms, which would include terms with different powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be a sum over all those terms, which would be 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought earlier. But wait, that would make the coefficient 384, but that seems too large. Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the constant term. So, that would be 6 * 20 = 120. Let me check both interpretations.\n\nFirst interpretation: The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would give a coefficient that is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying anything about \\(c\\), that would be the case. So, the coefficient would be 6 * \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because a coefficient should be a number, not an expression in \\(c\\). Therefore, maybe the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the same as \\(a^2b^2\\), in the product. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Let me confirm this approach. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, when multiplying these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. So, I think the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the coefficient might be 384, but that was when considering the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. But that would be the case if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), but that's not the case. The problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think it's referring to the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., the constant term. Therefore, 120 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try another approach. Let me think of the entire product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6a^2b^2. The second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply 6a^2b^2 by each term in the second polynomial, you get terms like 6a^2b^2c^6, 6a^2b^2c^4, ..., 6a^2b^2c^{-6}. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\( (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384, but that seems to contradict the earlier thought where I considered only the constant term. Wait, but in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second polynomial. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying \\(c\\), perhaps it's referring to the entire coefficient, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't seem right because usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term in a product, you might be considering the term in the product, which could have multiple variables. Wait, but in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is separate from \\(c\\), so perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not a numerical coefficient; it's an expression. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but the problem is written as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without any mention of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the intended answer is 384, considering all terms. Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. I'm a bit confused now. Let me think again.\n\nWhen you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables add up to that specific term. So, in this case, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not a single number; it's a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is miswritten, or perhaps I'm misinterpreting it. Alternatively, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is presented as a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is 120, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this by considering the entire expansion. Let me write out the product:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\left(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\right) \\times \\left(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\right)\n\\]\n\nNow, when I multiply these two, each term in the first sum is multiplied by each term in the second sum. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(k = 2\\) in the first sum, which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). Then, this is multiplied by each term in the second sum, which is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). But this is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire second polynomial. But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps it's intended to consider the constant term in \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But that would be if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), which isn't the case. Therefore, I think the correct approach is to consider the constant term in \\(c\\), leading to 120.\n\nBut let me check again. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = 64\\), so the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all powers of \\(c\\), would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems to be the case if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any mention of \\(c\\). Therefore, perhaps the answer is 384, but that seems odd because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of it differently. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a^2b^2. Then, when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion is a multiple of \\(c^k\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second polynomial. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying \\(c\\), which is a bit ambiguous. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is 120, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because coefficients are numerical. Therefore, I think the correct approach is to consider the constant term in \\(c\\), leading to 120.\n\nWait, but let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's intended to consider all powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.

Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial. But since the problem is presented in a way that expects a numerical answer, I think the intended answer is 120, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\).\n\nWait, but let me think of it in another way. If I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's only specifying \\(a^2b^2\\), not involving \\(c\\). So, perhaps the answer is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be 6 * (c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}), which is 6c^6 + 36c^4 + 90c^2 + 120 + 90c^{-2} + 36c^{-4} + 6c^{-6}. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is that entire expression. But that can't be, because a coefficient is a number, not a polynomial. Therefore, I think the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nTherefore, after all this thinking, I believe the correct answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, does that mean I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms? Or do I have to look for specific terms in the second expansion that might affect the coefficient? Wait, no, I think I might have misread. Let me check: the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get a product of two polynomials. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables independent of \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) will multiply the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), right? Wait, no, that can't be right because when you multiply by other terms, it might affect the coefficient. Wait, no, actually, when you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that's multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) will contribute to the coefficient. But wait, that doesn't make sense because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad. Wait, no, because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients combine. But in this case, since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a separate term, so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term would contribute to the overall coefficient. But wait, actually, no. Because in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too large. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second part, the variables don't interfere. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part with any term from the second part. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too straightforward. Wait, but let me verify. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2 respectively, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Because otherwise, if it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 times the entire expansion, which would be 6*64=384. But I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, let me try that approach. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply, \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) would give the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find that, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which means \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6*20=120. So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but earlier I thought it might be 384, but that was under the assumption that the problem didn't care about the \\(c\\) term, which is probably not the case. The problem likely wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but in reality, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, the coefficient would actually be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean 6 times 64, which is 384. But I'm confused now because both approaches seem possible. Wait, let me think again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) is determined by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But when the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient would be the sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms of the product of the coefficients from \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and in the second part, every term is multiplied by this 6, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. But that contradicts the earlier approach where I thought it was 120. So, which is correct? Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). If that's the case, then the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem doesn't specify the exponent of \\(c\\), so it's ambiguous. Wait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any condition on \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be the sum of all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems odd because usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term in a product, it's considering the term with specific exponents for all variables. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is indeed 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Let me see if there's a way to resolve this ambiguity. If I consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 384. But if it's asking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. Since the problem didn't specify the exponent of \\(c\\), I think the intended interpretation is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But to be thorough, let me check both possibilities. First, let's compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120, as I did earlier. Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any restriction on \\(c\\) is 384. Now, which one makes more sense? If the problem had specified \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), then it would be 120. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), it's more likely that they want the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have \\(a^2b^2\\) with any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient is 384. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about it differently. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum over all possible products of coefficients from each polynomial where the variables multiply to give \\(a^2b^2\\). Since the first polynomial is \\((a + b)^4\\) and the second is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think the answer is 384. But wait, I'm still a bit confused because in the problem statement, it's possible that they only want the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which would be 120. To resolve this, perhaps I should look at similar problems or think about how such questions are typically phrased. Usually, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) in a product involving other variables, they might be considering the term where the exponents of all variables are specified, but in this case, it's only \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe they don't care about \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 6*64=384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), so 120. Wait, maybe I can check by expanding a simpler version. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\), which is 2, so 2. But if I were to ask for the coefficient of \\(a c^0\\), that would be 1 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\((c + 1/c)\\), which is 1 (from the term 1/c^0). Wait, no, actually, in \\((c + 1/c)\\), the constant term is 2 when c=1, but the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 2? Wait, no, \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c, so the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 0, because there's no constant term. Wait, that's confusing. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a c^0\\) would be 1 times 0, which is 0. But that contradicts the earlier approach. Hmm, perhaps my initial assumption is wrong. Maybe the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384. I'm going to go with the interpretation that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120, because that seems more likely in the context of such problems, where they usually consider the term with specific exponents for all variables. So, to recap, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. But I'm still a bit unsure because the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\). However, given the structure of the problem, I think 120 is the intended answer.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each expansion:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " But the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect this coefficient? Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps we don't need to consider the terms from the second expression because they involve \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product of the two expressions. So, when you expand \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a separate expansion. Let me clarify: When you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply if the variables are the same. But in this case, the variables are different. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because then the coefficient would be 6 times something, but I think I'm misunderstanding. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem correct either because each term in the product would have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some term involving \\(c\\). So, actually, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad. Alternatively, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) (i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\)), then we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, that might make more sense. Let me check the problem again. It says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, maybe it's considering the entire product, but since \\(c\\) is another variable, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every possible term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because it would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but since it's not specified, perhaps it's just considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe it's actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, let me proceed under that assumption. Therefore, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, as I found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\) so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), it just asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, maybe I was wrong earlier. Let me think again. If the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is intended to consider only the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., the constant term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\) would be 6 times 20, which is 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(c\\) is separate, the coefficient would involve terms with \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem didn't specify any \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the intended answer is 120, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, without considering the other part. But that seems too simple, and the presence of the second part suggests that it's part of the problem. Therefore, I think the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which would make \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 would be 384, but that seems too high. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), meaning that for each term in \\((a + b)^4\\), we multiply by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, but that seems incorrect because it would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^{10}\\) or something like that, but as written, it's \\((a + b)^4 (c + 1/c)^6\\). So, to be precise, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since we're looking for a coefficient, which is a number, I think the problem expects us to consider only the constant term in \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is found by considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which happens at \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " But since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) because they won't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, but actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider how many ways \\(a^2b^2\\) can be formed when multiplied by terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that might not be necessary. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), right? Because the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, actually, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product will just be the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering any \\(c\\) terms. So maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that can't be, because the product will have terms involving \\(c\\) as well. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which would be a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is probably asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would include all possible terms from the product, but perhaps they just want the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve considering the entire expansion. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^k b^{4 - k} \\times c^m\\) or something like that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of the coefficients from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) for each term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2. Wait, but no, because when you multiply, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) only come from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), while the exponents of \\(c\\) come from the second part. So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by every possible term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then we can consider the product and find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 2^6, since each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), but when summed over all k, it's 2^6. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems high. Wait, let me think again. When you have two independent polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) are multiplied together, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. Since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), which would be 6, but that seems unlikely because the expression includes \\(c\\). So, perhaps the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the middle term when expanding. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the term where the exponent is 0 is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. But the problem just says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying \\(c\\), so perhaps it's considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Let me re-read the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, every term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{-m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of the coefficients of all terms where \\(k = 2\\) and \\(4 - k = 2\\), which is fixed, but multiplied by all possible coefficients from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem doesn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384. Wait, but that seems too large. Let me check again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. When you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But when we talk about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we usually mean the coefficient without considering other variables. So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. But to be thorough, let me consider the other approach where we're looking for the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. But since the problem doesn't specify \\(c^0\\), I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating, and the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and since the other part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient remains 6. But that doesn't seem right because the expression is a product, so the coefficient would be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would include all possible terms from both parts. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, I think the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let's think of it this way: When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first polynomial, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second polynomial contributes all possible terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial. The sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, yes, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. When multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n$\\boxed{384}$"

Wait, but that doesn't sound right. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would contribute to multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, thereby making the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product equal to the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of the coefficients from the other part. Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), right? Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives each term its coefficient without the variable. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of the entire expression, which would involve considering all possible combinations of terms from both expansions. But that might be more complicated. Wait, no, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps any term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, giving 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expression. Since the sum of the coefficients in the second expression is 64, as calculated before, then the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, meaning just 6, but that seems unlikely because the expression includes both parts. Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me try a different approach. Let me consider that when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, each term in the second part is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, I get terms of the form \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum over all \\(k\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\), because the coefficient from the first part is 6, and from the second part, each term contributes \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\). Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). But the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) from \\(k=0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\), so the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems consistent with my earlier calculation. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there a possibility that \\(a^2b^2\\) could come from other terms in the expansion? For example, could there be a cross term where some \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) come from one part and others from another? Wait, no, because \\((a + b)^4\\) only contains \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, while \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) only contains \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms. So, when you multiply them together, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are only from the first part, and \\(c\\) terms from the second part.

But that seems too simple. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it and the answer is just 6. But wait, no, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6*64=384. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me try another approach. Let's consider the entire expression: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I expand this, it's the product of two separate expansions. So, when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's equivalent to taking the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1, so \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. But wait, that seems a bit large. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering any \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the answer is just 6. But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply by the second expression, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expression, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expression, which is 64, leading to 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and when you multiply it by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion is a term in \\(c\\). So, the product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself, without considering \\(c\\), would be the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, multiplied by 6, giving 384. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would require considering all possible ways \\(a^2b^2\\) can be formed, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the first part, so the coefficient would just be 6 multiplied by the entire second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this, and the answer is simply 6, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient should be scaled by the number of terms in the second expression. Wait, but no, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the second part is being multiplied as a whole. So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion, but that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that it's 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. Hmm, I'm getting confused here. Let me try to think differently. Let's denote the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I expand this, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, the term from the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), multiplied by 6. But the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m\\) from 0 to 6 is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but that seems correct. So, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. When multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nSo, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. When multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient becomes 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"
