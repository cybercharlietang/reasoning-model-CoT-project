But no, because the second expansion only has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, any term from the second expansion would only affect the \\(c\\) part, not the \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) part. Therefore, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and multiply it by the \\(c^0\\) term from the second expansion. So, that confirms that the coefficient is 120. I think that's the correct answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. 1. Expanded \\((a + b)^4\\) and found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. 2. Expanded \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and found the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. 3. Multiplied them together to get 120. 4. Confirmed that there are no other contributions to \\(a^2b^2\\) from other terms. So, yeah, I'm confident the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the expansion of each part separately and then multiplying the relevant coefficients.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   - The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\) in the binomial expansion.\n   - Coefficient: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   - The term with \\(c^0\\) corresponds to \\(m = 3\\) in the binomial expansion.\n   - Coefficient: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients**:\n   - \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Wait, let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives 20 for \\(c^0\\). So, when you multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by 20 from the second part, resulting in 6*20=120. That seems correct. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Another way to think about it is that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, so when you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial multiplies each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), we can ignore all other terms in the second polynomial except the one that doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. So, that would be the constant term in the second polynomial. So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, if I were to write the entire product, it would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as I found earlier. Then, the corresponding term in the second sum must be \\(c^0\\), so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\). I think that's solid. Let me just check if I've made any calculation errors. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, correct. \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20, correct. 6 times 20 is 120, correct.
