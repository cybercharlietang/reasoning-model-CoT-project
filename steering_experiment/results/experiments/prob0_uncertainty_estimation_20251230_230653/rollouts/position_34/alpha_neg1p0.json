Wait, let me just double-check that. So, in the expansion, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and to get a term without \\(c\\), we need the \\(c^0\\) term from the second part. So, yes, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120.
