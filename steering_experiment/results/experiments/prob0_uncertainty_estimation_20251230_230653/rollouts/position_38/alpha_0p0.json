But wait, no, that's not correct either because the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\), so when you multiply, the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial, but since we're only interested in the coefficient, not the entire term, perhaps I need to consider that the second polynomial's terms don't interfere with the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial would be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which has various powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would appear for each \\(k\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) alone (without any \\(c\\) terms) would only come from the term where \\(k=0\\), because otherwise, there would be a \\(c\\) term attached. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial. So, that's 6 times 20, which is 120. Yeah, that makes sense. So, I think I did it right. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the final coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"
