The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Since these two terms multiply together to give the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, the overall coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will only multiply the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) in the second expansion to give a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms in the second expansion will have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they'll give terms like \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), which aren't the same as \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the only contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term and the constant term in the second expansion. So, yes, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. Wait, but let me think again. Is there any possibility that other terms in the first expansion could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by terms in the second expansion? For example, if I have a term like \\(a^3b\\) in the first expansion, and a term like \\(1/c\\) in the second, would that ever combine to give \\(a^2b^2\\)? No, because you can't get rid of an \\(a\\) or a \\(b\\) by multiplying with a term involving \\(c\\). So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and the \\(c^0\\) term from the second expansion. Therefore, my initial reasoning seems correct. So, the coefficient is 120. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, calculated as \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, calculated as \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. I think that makes sense. I don't see any errors in my calculations or reasoning.

So, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20.

Let me see. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the entire expansion as a product of two polynomials and look for the term where the exponents of a and b are 2 each, regardless of the c terms.

    "text": " Wait, let me double-check that. So, in the expansion, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\cdot c^{-m}\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). That seems correct. So, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the other expansion is 20. Since these two terms multiply together in the product, the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, is that right? Let me think again. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) as 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from the other expansion as 20. So, when you multiply these two, you get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Hmm, that makes sense because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, I think that's the correct coefficient.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I'm not making a mistake, let me consider if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe expanding both expressions fully and then looking for the term, but that seems tedious. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of two polynomials, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial and the constant term in the second polynomial. Since the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\), which is a different variable, the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) is to multiply by the constant term. Therefore, the coefficient would indeed be the product of the two coefficients. So, 6 times 20 is 120. I think that's correct.\n\nWait, another thought: when you have two separate variables, like \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), the exponents in each variable are independent. So, when you multiply two polynomials, the exponents add separately. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all, so the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part where the exponents match. So, yes, 6 times 20 is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check my binomial coefficients again. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Correct. For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent is 0 is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Correct. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I'm not missing anything, let me consider if there's any other term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get that term is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial by the constant term from the second polynomial. Any other term from the second polynomial would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) term, which would make the product have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), which has \\(k = 0\\). So, yes, only the constant term contributes, and that's 20. So, the final coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.
