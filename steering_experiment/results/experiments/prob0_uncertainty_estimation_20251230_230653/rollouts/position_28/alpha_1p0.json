Is there a possibility that other terms could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by terms from the second polynomial? For example, if I take a term with \\(a^1b^3\\) from the first polynomial and multiply it by a term with \\(c^{-1}\\) from the second, would that somehow result in \\(a^2b^2\\) when combined? No, because the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are determined solely by the first polynomial, and the exponents of \\(c\\) are determined by the second. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), their exponents don't interfere.

So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which means \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of 6 and 20, which is 120. Wait, is that right? Let me double-check. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient for \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when we multiply these two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we only consider the term where the second polynomial contributes a constant term, which is 20. So, the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being a product of two polynomials, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, but that doesn't seem right because the second polynomial has terms in \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, when you multiply by a polynomial in \\(c\\), each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, but only the constant term would result in a term that's \\(a^2b^2\\) times a constant, which is what we want. All other terms would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so they wouldn't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term without \\(c\\). So, yes, it's just 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's correct.

So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient should be 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, in the first expansion, \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs at \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is 20. Multiplying them gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can think of it another way.

The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6a^2b^2. The term we need in the second part is the constant term, which is 20. So, when we multiply 6a^2b^2 by 20, we get 120a^2b^2. All other terms from the second polynomial would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) term, so they wouldn't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120.
