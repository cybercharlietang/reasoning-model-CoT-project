So, let's tackle the second part: finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\).

First, I correctly identified that I needed the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, I correctly determined that to get a term without \\(c\\) (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) in the second polynomial, I needed \\(m = 3\\), giving a coefficient of 20. Multiplying them together gives 120.
