    "text": " Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120. Wait, but let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2. The term \\(c^0\\) from the second polynomial is 20. So, when you multiply them, you get 6 * 20 * a\u00b2b\u00b2 * c^0, which is 120a\u00b2b\u00b2. So, yes, the coefficient is 120. I think that's correct.

I think that makes sense. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. We have two separate polynomials multiplied together: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). We're looking for the coefficient of a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), specifically \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the only way that term can appear in the product is if we take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and multiply it by the constant term (which doesn't involve \\(c\\)) from the second polynomial. So, the coefficients multiply together, giving 6 * 20 = 120. I don't see any mistakes in this reasoning.
