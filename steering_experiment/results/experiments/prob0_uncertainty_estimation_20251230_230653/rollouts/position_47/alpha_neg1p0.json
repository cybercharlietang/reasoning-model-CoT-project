Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. We have two separate polynomials being multiplied together: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in \\(c\\). Since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way this term can appear in the product is if we take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiply it by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second polynomial.

I think that makes sense. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem. Alternatively, I could consider that when multiplying the two polynomials, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part and the constant term in the second part, as any other term would introduce \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, yeah, I think 120 is the correct coefficient. I don't think I made any mistakes in my calculations. The binomial coefficients were calculated correctly: 6 choose 2 is 15? Wait, no, wait.

    "text": " Therefore, the coefficient should indeed be 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), which is correct. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\), and we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), which is correct. So, 6 times 20 is 120, so the coefficient is 120. I think that's the right answer. Let me just visualize the multiplication to be thorough. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). Now, when you multiply these two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial will multiply each term in the second polynomial. However, only the constant term (20) in the second polynomial will result in a term that doesn't have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, \\(a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 20a^2b^2\\). All other terms would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) component, which we don't want. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 20 times 6, which is 120. Wait, no, wait a second. Wait, in the first polynomial, the coefficient is 6, and in the second, it's 20. So, when you multiply, it's 6 * 20 = 120, correct. So, yes, 120 is the coefficient. I think that's correct.
