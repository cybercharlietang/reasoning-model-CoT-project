    "text": " Let me think again. Suppose I expand both expressions fully. The first expansion has terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). The second expansion has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^5 \\times (1/c) = 6c^4\\), \\(15c^3 \\times (1/c)^2 = 15c\\), \\(20c^2 \\times (1/c)^3 = 20\\), and so on. Wait, actually, when I expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponents go from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\) in steps of 2. So, the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which is at \\(m = 3\\), as I found before, and the coefficient is 20. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the only way to get a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by the \\(c^0\\) term.

So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second expansion.

All other terms would have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so they wouldn't be part of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, I think my initial conclusion is correct: the coefficient is 120.

We're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\).
