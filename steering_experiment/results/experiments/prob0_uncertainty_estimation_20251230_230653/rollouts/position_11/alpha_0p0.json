    "text": " Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is only in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). However, the entire expression's coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, maybe I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms at all? Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, actually, the problem is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so when we multiply the two expressions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the term in \\((a + b)^4\\), the rest of the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a numerical value, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, no, actually, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes only from the first part, the second part can be any term, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's not right because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a separate term, so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, actually, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the question is probably expecting a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, when you multiply the two expressions, you'll have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., and the coefficient for each of these would be 6 times the corresponding coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think refers to the coefficient when considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term, and when multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\), it becomes different terms. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's not exactly right because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). However, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then perhaps it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high, and I'm not sure if that's the right approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since the two expressions are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the second part is just a separate factor. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when the entire expression is expanded, considering all variables. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's not correct because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a separate term, so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes a separate term in the product. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times each coefficient from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. Therefore, the coefficient is 6.\n\nWait, but that seems too simple. Let me check again. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, you get terms like \\(a^4b^0c^6\\), \\(a^4b^0c^4\\), etc., up to \\(a^0b^4c^{-6}\\), each multiplied by the corresponding terms from \\((a + b)^4\\). But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and its coefficient is 6. The other part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each of these terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6 * 1 = 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 6 * 6 = 36, and so on. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's actually 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be 6 * (c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6). But that's a polynomial, not a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a separate factor, so the coefficient remains 6.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. That is, the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). So, in that case, we would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let's find that.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering only the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), would be 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, that makes sense because the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when the entire expression is considered as a product, but only the constant term with respect to \\(c\\) is considered. So, the coefficient is 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)), giving 120.\n\nLet me verify this. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. Therefore, when you multiply these two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, giving a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120 for \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nI think that's the correct approach. So, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives us 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives the coefficient as 120.\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. But wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that mean I need to consider the other part as well? Hmm, because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it. So, when I multiply the two expansions together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the second part can have any term, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, the second part doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, that might not be right. Let me think again. The entire expression is the product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when we multiply them, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only appears in the first polynomial. The second polynomial, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms involving \\(c\\) raised to different powers, but since \\(c\\) is a different variable, multiplying by any term from the second polynomial won't affect the exponent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, no, that's not quite accurate. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of the corresponding terms. But in this case, since the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is in the first polynomial and the second polynomial doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, effectively scaling it by each coefficient in the second polynomial. So, to clarify, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is (coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by (sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, first, let me compute the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients in the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but let me double-check that reasoning because sometimes when variables are involved, especially with negative exponents, the sum of coefficients might not just be plugging in 1. But in this case, since \\(c\\) is a variable and \\(1/c\\) is another term, setting \\(c = 1\\) should give the sum of the coefficients because each term becomes 1. For example, if I have a term like \\(c^k\\), when \\(c = 1\\), it's 1, and similarly, \\((1/c)^k = 1\\) when \\(c = 1\\). So, the entire expression when \\(c = 1\\) is indeed the sum of the coefficients. Therefore, the sum is 64, as I thought. So, putting it all together, the coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384. Hmm, but wait, let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first expansion, and it's multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. That makes sense because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the sum of coefficients. So, the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I set \\(c = 1\\), then each term becomes \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), and raising that to the 6th power gives 64, which is correct. So, the sum of the coefficients is indeed 64. Therefore, multiplying by 6 gives 384. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, since the variables in the two polynomials are different (\\(a, b\\) in the first and \\(c, 1/c\\) in the second), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiply it by any term from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me just go through it again step by step to make sure I didn't skip anything. So, first, the problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). We need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms like \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, 1, 1/c^2, 1/c^4, 1/c^6\\), each with coefficients. The sum of these coefficients is found by plugging \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, when we multiply the two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes only from the first polynomial, and the second polynomial's terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (the sum of coefficients from the second part). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to approach it is to consider that when you have two independent variables, the coefficients multiply when you take the product of the polynomials. So, since the variables \\(a, b\\) and \\(c, 1/c\\) are independent, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the product of the coefficients in each respective part. So, since in the first part, the coefficient is 6, and in the second part, the sum of coefficients is 64, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that confirms it again.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think if there's any other way this could be interpreted. For example, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), then we would have to consider the specific term in the second polynomial that has \\(c^k\\). But in this case, it's only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that means we have to consider all possible terms from the second polynomial, each multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed the product of the two coefficients as I calculated before. So, I think I'm confident that 384 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. So, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, correct? Because 4! is 24, 2! is 2, so 24/(2*2) is 6. Yep, that's right. And \\(2^6\\) is 64, that's correct. So, 6 times 64 is 384. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nI think I've considered it from multiple angles and each time I arrive at the same conclusion. So, I think the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), yielding \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these results gives the coefficient as \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n$\\boxed{384}$"

Alternatively, perhaps it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, because \\(c^0\\) is the term that doesn't change the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, that might make more sense. Let me think: when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term from the second expansion, say \\(c^k\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\).

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me clarify: the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that multiplies \\(a^2b^2\\).

But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so each term would have a different power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion. That makes more sense. So, let me proceed with that approach.\n\nFirst, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already found to be 6.\n\nNext, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand this using the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from the first expansion) multiplied by 20 (from the second expansion). So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from the second part with coefficient 20. When you multiply these two terms together, you get \\(6 \\times 20 \\times a^2b^2c^0\\), so the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I think that's not what the problem is asking because it specifically mentions \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion, giving 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me confirm by expanding both expressions. Let me write out \\((a + b)^4\\) as \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6.\n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded as \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15\\dfrac{1}{c^2} + 6\\dfrac{1}{c^4} + \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\). So, the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) is 20.\n\nTherefore, when we multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Wait, but that's not correct because each term in the product will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's actually asking for the sum of all coefficients where the term is \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any integer \\(k\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives a term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) with coefficient equal to the product of the two coefficients.\n\nSo, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but this contradicts my earlier conclusion. Hmm, now I'm confused. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be the sum of all terms of the form \\(6 \\times \\text{coefficient from the second expansion}\\) because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). So, if we're just interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought it was 120 when considering only the \\(c^0\\) term. So, which is correct?\n\nLet me check with a small example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it's \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the first part is 1. The sum of coefficients in the second part is 2 (since \\(c + 1/c\\) evaluated at \\(c=1\\) is 2). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. But if I expand it, the terms are \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 for \\(ac\\) and 1 for \\(a/c\\), so total coefficient is 2, which matches 1 * 2. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is indeed the coefficient in the first part times the sum of coefficients in the second part.\n\nSimilarly, if I were to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given problem, it would be the coefficient in the first part times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, in my initial approach, I thought it was 120 because I was considering only the \\(c^0\\) term. But in the small example, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, which is the sum of coefficients from the second expansion times the coefficient from the first. So, perhaps I was wrong earlier, and the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's indeed 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without mentioning \\(c\\). So, it's ambiguous. But in the context of polynomial expressions, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\), it's usually in the entire product, considering all possible powers of other variables. So, in this case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so it's likely that it's considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), meaning the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the \\(c\\) term. Therefore, the answer should be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut now I'm confused because earlier I thought it was 120. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, 1, 1/c^2, 1/c^4, 1/c^6\\). Each of these multiplications results in a term like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of the coefficients of all these terms. Therefore, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second part (which is 64). So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, in the small example, when I had \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) was 2, which is the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first part (1) times the sum of coefficients in the second part (2). So, that supports the idea that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another approach. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) contributes a coefficient that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives a term in the product with \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut since the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying \\(c\\), I think it's 384.\n\nWait, but let me check the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the problem is considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nBut I'm still a bit unsure because sometimes in such problems, the coefficient is considered for the term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) and no other variables, but in this case, the expression includes \\(c\\), so it's possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. But since it's not specified, I'm not sure. Let me see if there's another way to interpret it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), which would be 384. But I think that's more likely because if it was asking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would have specified.\n\nWait, but in the context of polynomial expressions, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\), it's often in the ring of polynomials, meaning that you consider the coefficient regardless of other variables. So, in this case, it would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nBut I'm still a bit confused because in the small example, when I set \\(c = 1\\), I get the sum of coefficients, which is 64, and multiplying by 6 gives 384. But if I think of the product as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 384, because each term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but let me try to compute it more carefully. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which has coefficients 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1 for \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, 1, 1/c^2, 1/c^4, 1/c^6\\) respectively. So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(15a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(20a^2b^2\\), \\(15a^2b^2 \\times 1/c^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 1/c^4\\), and \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1/c^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all these coefficients: 1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64. Then, multiplying by the coefficient from the first expansion, which is 6, gives 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384.\n\nBut wait, in my earlier approach, I thought of it as 6 * 64, but actually, it's 6 multiplied by each coefficient from the second expansion, and then summed up. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, no, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients from each expansion. So, since \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion has a coefficient of 6, and each term in the second expansion has coefficients 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6*(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6*64 = 384.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to compute the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6*(sum of coefficients in the second expansion) = 6*64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   To find the sum of all coefficients, set \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n   This means the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64.\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficient from the first expansion and the sum of coefficients from the second expansion:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). Okay, so the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait a second, actually, I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second part of the expression, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\). So, when I multiply the two expressions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right. Because if I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then I don't actually need to consider the \\(c\\) terms at all. Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{something with } c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only considering the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, the coefficient would be 6 times whatever the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is. Wait, that might not be correct. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each factor. But in this case, the first factor is \\((a + b)^4\\) and the second is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms in the product will be combinations where each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, for example, a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first expansion times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second expansion that don't involve \\(c\\). But wait, the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so there are no constant terms. Therefore, when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) is if you multiply by the constant term, but since \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) doesn't have a constant term, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be zero. Wait, that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient, so maybe I'm misunderstanding something. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's not correct because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\), the second part becomes 64, so the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that's not correct because when you have variables, you can't just substitute like that. Let me try to clarify. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first factor, and when you multiply it by the second factor, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the result will be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But that's only if we're considering the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, setting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me think again. Is that the correct approach? Because if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then yes, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), that would be different, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's 384. Wait, but let me check that again. Let me consider the expansion more carefully. The first expansion is \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's compute that using the binomial theorem: \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the terms are \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when we multiply the two expansions, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself (without any \\(c\\) terms) would be 6 times the constant term in the second expansion. Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. Because the constant term in the second expansion is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, so earlier I thought it was 384, but now I'm thinking it's 120. Which one is correct? Let me clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. If we consider the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives a term with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself (without any \\(c\\)) would be the coefficient when \\(k = 0\\), which is the constant term. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, that's not correct because the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is 64, as I calculated earlier. So, 6 * 64 = 384. But that would mean that in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high. Alternatively, if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, in reality, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one variable is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, you're effectively scaling \\(a^2b^2\\) by each coefficient in the second polynomial. So, yes, the coefficient would be 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second polynomial). The sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, earlier I thought that the constant term in the second expansion is 20, so if I'm only considering the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, then the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. So, which is it? I think the confusion arises from whether the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\) or specifically the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\). If it's the former, then it's 384. If it's the latter, then it's 120. Let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It just says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any power of \\(c\\). So, in the context of polynomials with multiple variables, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term, it's usually considering all possible powers of the other variables. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think of it another way. Suppose I expand the entire product. The first part is a polynomial in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\). When I multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 6*6=36, and so on. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's the sum of all these coefficients, which would be 6*(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6*64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6*20 = 120. So, I think the key here is understanding what the problem is asking. Since it just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying any power of \\(c\\), I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6*64=384. But I'm still a bit unsure because sometimes in such problems, they might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but the problem doesn't specify. To confirm, let me consider the problem again: it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, it's in the product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). When you multiply them, each term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial. Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, you get terms with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial times 6. Since the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, the coefficient is 6*64=384. Therefore, I think the correct answer is 384. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 120. Let me make sure. Let me compute the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When \\(c = 1\\), this becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6*64=384. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, if I were to compute the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384. Therefore, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient from the \\((a + b)^4\\) expansion, which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients from the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion, which is 64. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " Let me compute that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms? Or do I? Hmm, let me think. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term from the first part, we need to consider how it interacts with the second part. However, the \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), right? So, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it will just add some coefficient to \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think we can consider that the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients from both parts. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the \\(c\\) terms might contribute a factor that affects the coefficient. Let me clarify: The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will accumulate all those coefficients. Wait, no, that's not correct because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expression, you're effectively creating terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), each with their own coefficients. But the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps we need to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you expand, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Alternatively, perhaps it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second expression, but since the second expression is multiplied as a whole, the coefficients get multiplied. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{2}b^{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{m - (6 - m)}\\) or something like that. Wait, no, more accurately, each term in the first expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{2}b^{2}\\) and each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{m} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{6 - m} = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{m - (6 - m)} = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{2m - 6}\\). So, when you multiply these together, you get terms like \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^{2}b^{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{2m - 6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Wait, no, that's not correct because the sum would be the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times 64 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, but that can't be right because the second part is being multiplied, so every term in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. So, that would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all the terms in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 times 64, giving 384. But wait, let me confirm this. Alternatively, maybe the second part is being multiplied, so each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. So, that would be 6 times 64, which is 384. So, I think the answer is 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake. Let me think differently. Let me consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\). So, when expanding, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all these coefficients, which is 1 times 1 (from \\(c^6\\)), 6 times 1 (from \\(c^4\\)), 15 times 1 (from \\(c^2\\)), 20 times 1 (from the constant term), 15 times 1 (from \\(c^{-2}\\)), 6 times 1 (from \\(c^{-4}\\)), and 1 times 1 (from \\(c^{-6}\\)). So, adding these up: 1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64. Wait, that's the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is indeed 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6 times 64 is 384. So, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expression. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that's not correct because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think of it another way. Let me compute the entire expansion step by step. First, expand \\((a + b)^4\\):\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6.\n\nNow, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{0} = 1\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{1} = 6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{2} = 15\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), and then it decreases symmetrically: 15, 6, 1.\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6 \\times 6 a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(6 \\times 15 a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2\\), and so on. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the sum of all these coefficients. Specifically, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that can't be right because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me consider a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). So, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the first part is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the product would be 1 times 2 = 2. But if I expand it, it's \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 times (c + 1/c), which is not a constant. Wait, but in this case, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

So, I guess the next step is to expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as well. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).

The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, but in the expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we're dealing with variables \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), which are different from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, does that mean that when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) terms are in the second part? \n\nSo, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only present in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, it would just be \\(6a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I need to consider how the two expansions interact. \n\nWait, no, actually, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second part.

But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the second expansion has multiple terms. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the question is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is present only in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by the entire second part, it would result in \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is not a single number but a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. That is, the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, the problem statement is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" \n\nSo, perhaps the question is to find the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't seem right because usually, when asking for a coefficient, it's in terms of a specific term, which would include all variables. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. \n\nSo, let me assume that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, I need to find the term in the expansion where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. So, to do that, I need to consider the product of the two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nFirst, as I did before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I'm effectively multiplying each term in the first expansion by each term in the second expansion. \n\nSo, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because \\(c^0 = 1\\), so we need to find the term in the second expansion where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. \n\nSo, let's set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) and solve for \\(m\\). \n\n\\(6 - 2m = 0\\)\n\n\\(2m = 6\\)\n\n\\(m = 3\\)\n\nSo, when \\(m = 3\\), the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Since these two coefficients are multiplied together when taking the product of the expansions, the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is indeed \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make a mistake, let me go through it again. \n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). \n\nNext, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\) from the second expansion, which has a coefficient of 20. So, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. Therefore, the answer should be 120. \n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me consider another approach. Maybe using multinomial coefficients or generating functions. But in this case, since the variables are separate, I think the approach I took is correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a coefficient, implying a numerical value. So, I think the correct interpretation is that they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nSo, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term from the first part, and since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire second expansion. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would just be the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient would be the same as in the first part, because all the terms from the second expansion are just multiplied by that coefficient. Wait, that can't be right because the entire product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply that we're considering \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion, which is when the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., when \\(k = 3\\) because \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will have terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 6 - 2k, right? Wait, no, let me correct that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponents of \\(c\\) will be 6 - 2m for m from 0 to 6. Now, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero (i.e., the constant term) occurs when 6 - 2m = 0, which is when m = 3. So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). Therefore, when we multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term (which has a coefficient of 6) by the constant term from the second expansion (which is 20), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but is that correct? Because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, if we're looking for terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), then the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire second expansion. But that can't be, because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product, and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But that can't be right because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the entire second expansion, which would include terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, which would be 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the \\(a^2b^2\\) term without any \\(c\\) terms, so it's 6 times the constant term from the second expansion, which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just multiplied as a whole, so the coefficient remains 6. But that seems unlikely because the second part is a binomial raised to a power, so it's not a constant. Hmm, maybe I should think of it differently. Let's consider the entire expression: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanded, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means we need to find all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for each \\(m\\), but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that includes all possible powers of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a numerical value, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, if that's the case, then we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, if the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but that doesn't seem right because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient. So, I think the intended interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion, which is 20, so the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check this. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply the two expressions, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), \\(1/c^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all these terms multiplied by 6. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's ambiguous whether it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\) or just the constant term. However, in standard problems like this, when they ask for the coefficient of a specific term, they usually mean the constant term unless specified otherwise. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the constant term from the second expansion, which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 times the entire second expansion, which would be a polynomial, but that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical answer. Therefore, I think the correct approach is to consider the constant term, so the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which in the context of the entire product would imply that we're looking for the coefficient when \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial. But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my earlier reasoning. Let me correct it.\n\nThe correct approach is to recognize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But since the second expansion is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually a polynomial, not a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a factor that's being multiplied as a whole. But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire product.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial. But that seems odd because the problem is likely expecting a numerical answer. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a multiplier, so the coefficient remains 6. But that can't be right because the second part is a binomial raised to a power, so it's not a constant.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering that the entire product is a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), consisting of all the terms from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial. But that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical answer. Therefore, I think the intended answer is 120, considering only the constant term.\n\nWait, but to be thorough, let me consider both interpretations.\n\nFirst interpretation: The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. In this case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But this seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient.\n\nSecond interpretation: The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion. In this case, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nGiven that, I think the intended answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we first consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\) in the expansion, giving a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) occurs when \\(m = 3\\), giving a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of these two coefficients: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I guess the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is just a part of the first expansion, and then it's multiplied by the entire second expansion. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Wait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term only comes from the first part, right? Because the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by anything from the second expansion, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times some terms involving \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents, maybe the coefficient remains the same as in the first part. Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. When you have a product of two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes only from the first expansion, and the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the same as in the first part. So, that would be 6. Wait, but that seems too simple. Let me check if I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is more complex, and I'm supposed to consider the entire expansion, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, their exponents aren't affected by the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed just be 6, and the rest of the terms would involve \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but those don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. Therefore, the coefficient remains 6. Hmm, maybe I should verify this by considering the entire expansion, but I think that's unnecessary because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part. So, yes, the coefficient is 6.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is determined by expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. Since the second part of the expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), does not contain \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it does not affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).

So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how the multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait a second, does the second part of the expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\), right? So, when we multiply two expressions together, the terms in each expression don't interfere with each other in terms of variable exponents. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means the coefficient in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part. Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and I multiply it by any term from the second part, the resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would mean the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out, so that the term is just a constant multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in other words, we need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) because when you multiply it by \\(a^2b^2\\), it will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. \n\nSo, let me first find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the constant term from the second part. So, that's 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 times 20 is 120. \n\nWait, let me just double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. When I multiply these two parts together, any term from the first part gets multiplied by every term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider how the terms from the second part affect the variables. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the only way the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is affected is by multiplying it by the constant term from the second part. Because if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term that has a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that term will have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), which are not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the constant term from the second part will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nWait, another way to think about it: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms that multiply together to give that specific term. In this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the other, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by the constant term from the second part.

The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a single number. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which should be a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Wait, no, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I thought earlier, the sum of the coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, let me check that. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, when I multiply the two expressions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. That seems plausible. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem, and it's actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the constant term in \\(c\\). That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial. So, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That would make the coefficient a single number. \n\nIf that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I found earlier. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me compute that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, the problem is probably asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, if it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384, but that seems unlikely because it would be a very large coefficient, and usually, such problems ask for specific terms. So, I think the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nLet me verify this. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, when we multiply these two parts, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), we take the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, if I consider the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would mean summing all the coefficients from the second part, which is 64, and then multiplying by 6 to get 384. But I think that's not the intended interpretation because usually, in such problems, they specify the term they want, including all variables. So, I think the correct answer is 120. \n\nLet me see if there's another way to approach this. Maybe I can consider the entire expression and look for the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has coefficient 6, and in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(c^0\\) has coefficient 20. Therefore, when multiplying these two parts, the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would have coefficient 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, if I were to expand the entire expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that would mean that the coefficient is 384, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nTo confirm, let me think about how the multiplication works. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is not just 6, but 6 multiplied by each of the coefficients from the second part. But if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. However, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think the key here is to interpret the problem correctly. The problem says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so it's possible that it's asking for the coefficient regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut I'm a bit confused because usually, when variables are present, they are specified. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. To resolve this, let me think about the structure of the problem. The expression is a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When you multiply them, the variables are independent, so the terms are of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) ranges from -6 to 6 in steps of 2. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each \\(c^m\\) term, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would be 6 * 20 = 120. Since the problem doesn't specify the \\(c\\) term, I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384. \n\nWait, but that seems counterintuitive because the coefficient should be a single number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nLet me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't mention \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that's a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is miswritten, or I'm misinterpreting it. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nTo be safe, I think the intended answer is 120, as that makes sense when considering specific terms. So, I'll go with 120 as the coefficient.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, the coefficient is 6.\n\nNow, the expression also has another part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the problem is about \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, does that mean I can treat the two parts separately? Like, the coefficient I found in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and then I have to multiply it by whatever the coefficient is in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? But wait, no, because the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking about the term involving \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe I can just consider the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if I'm looking for \\(a^2b^2\\) times something, but I don't care about the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the coefficient of the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think again. So, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When you multiply them together, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find all the terms in the second polynomial that are constants (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) because multiplying by a constant won't introduce any \\(c\\) terms, so the product will still have \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's apply the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). That seems correct. Then, for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I found the constant term by setting the exponent to 0, which gave me \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). That also seems correct. Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120, so that should be the coefficient. I think that makes sense because each part is independent, so their coefficients multiply when you take the product of the two expressions. So, yeah, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by expanding each part separately and then multiplying the relevant coefficients. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**  \n   Using the binomial theorem, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**  \n   The constant term (where exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) is found when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\).

I notice that this part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when I multiply the two expressions together, the coefficients from \\((a + b)^4\\) will multiply the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms unless they affect the exponent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).

But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), if I set \\(c = 1\\), I get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but that seems a bit high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product of the two expressions. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, as I found earlier. So, 6 * 64 is indeed 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I can consider that the coefficient is 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because each term in the second expansion would contribute to different powers of \\(c\\). But the problem isn't asking about a specific power of \\(c\\), just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would indeed be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by terms from the second expansion, you can get different powers of \\(c\\). But the problem didn't specify any power of \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. That can't be right because the question is asking for a coefficient, which should be a numerical value. Therefore, I must have made a mistake earlier. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the constant term in \\(c\\), meaning \\(c^0\\). Let me check that possibility. \n\nIf that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the constant term. To find that, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the exponent to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so I'm confused. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It just says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without mentioning \\(c\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term from the second expansion, each of which has some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all those products, which is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, if I consider the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the product, and its coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. So, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so maybe I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), meaning that it's the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). Because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps the intended interpretation is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I'm not sure. Let me check both possibilities. \n\nFirst, if we consider all powers of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nIf we consider only the constant term in \\(c\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nHmm, which one makes more sense? The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without mentioning \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) depends on the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would include all terms where \\(k=2\\), regardless of \\(m\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 64, so 384. \n\nBut that seems odd because the coefficient would then be a polynomial. Wait, no, actually, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. \n\nWait, maybe I should look for similar problems or think about how the problem is structured. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests that it's considering the term without any \\(c\\) factors, or perhaps it's considering the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. \n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify, so maybe I should proceed with the assumption that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. If I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, each of which is a power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, meaning that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0, respectively. In that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). \n\nTo do that, I can consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from the second part with coefficient 20, as I found earlier. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nBut the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I'm still confused. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It just says \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering the entire product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. \n\nWait, maybe I should think about how the problem is written. It says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so perhaps it's implying that \\(c\\) is being treated as a separate variable, and the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the intended interpretation is that we are to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) have exponents 2 and 2, and \\(c\\) has exponent 0. \n\nIn that case, the coefficient would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), giving 120. \n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Let me try to confirm by considering how the product works. \n\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, each term in the product will be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), where \\(k\\) is the exponent from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all \\(k\\) of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible \\(k\\), so the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient is 384, regardless of \\(c\\). So, perhaps that's the answer. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would be 120. \n\nI think I need to decide which interpretation is correct. Since the problem didn't specify any power of \\(c\\), I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so the answer would be 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. If the problem had said \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)\", it would have been 120, but since it didn't specify, maybe it's 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the terms where \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., \\(c^0\\), which would make the coefficient 120. \n\nWait, perhaps I should check the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), without any mention of \\(c\\). Therefore, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all \\(c\\) terms multiplied by 6. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but that seems too large. Let me think about a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 2, so 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) would also be 2. But if I were to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^0\\), it would be 1 * 2 (from \\(c^0\\)), which is 2. \n\nWait, but in that case, if I have \\((a + b)^1 (c + 1/c)^1\\), the expansion is \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^1\\) is 1, and the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^{-1}\\) is 1, and similarly for \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 + 1 = 2, considering both \\(c^1\\) and \\(c^{-1}\\). Therefore, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is indeed 2, which is 1 (from the first part) times 2 (sum of coefficients in the second part). \n\nTherefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but that seems high, but considering the expansion, it might make sense. Let me try to compute it step by step. \n\nFirst, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nThe sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). \n\nTherefore, when you multiply the two expansions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nSo, I think that's the answer. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. \n\nWait, but let me check once more. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 384. \n\nYes, I think that's correct. So, the final answer is 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, so 120. \n\nBut without more context, it's hard to tell. However, given the problem statement, I think the intended answer is 120, considering the constant term in \\(c\\). \n\nWait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think carefully. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so in the product, each term is \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\), where \\(k\\) is from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) is from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^m\\). But the problem is asking for a single numerical coefficient, which suggests that it's considering all possible \\(m\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nBut since the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), I think the answer is 384. \n\nWait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about how the problem is presented. It says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which suggests that it's considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 64, so 384. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 384. \n\nBut to be thorough, let me compute the product step by step. \n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). \n\nSecond, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWhen I multiply these two, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}\\), which is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nSo, that confirms it. The coefficient is 384. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 120, but that's only if we're considering the constant term in \\(c\\). Since the problem didn't specify, I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which is 384. \n\nTherefore, I conclude that the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, since the problem doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), we consider the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{384}"

    "text": " Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, right? Because 4 choose 2 is 6. So, the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I have to consider both parts. But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not involving \\(c\\). So, maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, but wait, actually, the entire expression is a product of two expansions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will multiply every term in the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we are only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the \\(c\\) terms are just constants as far as \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are concerned. Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. \n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, in this case, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), it's like scaling the entire \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part by that coefficient.\n\nWait, so maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 (from the first part) times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. But how do I find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first polynomial, and it's being multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part adds to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product being the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in each part, but since the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), maybe it's just 1 for each term, so the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, so it's 6 times 64. That seems right.\n\nWait, let me try another approach to confirm. Let's think of the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and it's multiplied by the entire second part. So, when you look at the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part. So, yes, 6 times 64 is 384.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm wrong because the second part doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second part, the \\(c\\) terms are separate. So, actually, each term in the second part is just a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those terms, each of those products would be a term in the final expansion, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would just be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part adds to the coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, perhaps another way to see it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), effectively scaling it by each coefficient, and then the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all those scaled coefficients.\n\nSo, I think that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384. So, I think the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me just double-check my steps. First, I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) correctly as 6. Then, I found the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives 2^6 = 64. Then, multiplying these together gives 6 * 64 = 384. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present only in the first part, and the second part doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only looking for the coefficient, it's 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose variables add up to that term. But in this case, since the second polynomial doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiplying it by the constant term (in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)) from the second polynomial. But wait, no, the second polynomial doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so every term in the second polynomial is a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But since we're only looking for the coefficient, it's the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm confusing something here. Let me think again: the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, each of these terms is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, I get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not involving \\(c\\). Wait, that's a different question. Wait, actually, no, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". But in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term from the second part, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself isn't present unless we have a term in the second part that's a constant, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, maybe I was wrong earlier. Let me correct that.\n\nWait, that's a crucial point. The problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the product, each term will be a combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) terms. So, if I'm looking for the term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, that would mean that in the second part, I need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term from the second part, you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant, which is a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and no \\(c\\).\n\nSo, in that case, I was wrong earlier. I should not be multiplying by the sum of all coefficients, but rather by the coefficient of the constant term in the second part. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nOkay, so let's correct that. Let me first find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do that, I can use the binomial theorem again. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, so earlier I thought it was 384, but now I realize it's 120 because I was considering the sum of all coefficients, but actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, so only the term where the second part contributes a constant. So, that makes more sense.\n\nLet me double-check this. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. Then, in the second part, the term that doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents is the constant term, which is 20. So, when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by 20, you get \\(120a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient is 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. I think I made a mistake earlier by considering the sum of all coefficients, but actually, the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, so only the constant term from the second part contributes to that.\n\nTherefore, the correct coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**  \n   Using the binomial theorem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**  \n   The constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) is found by solving \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), giving \\(k = 3\\).

So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of these two expansions. Wait, but actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all different variables, when I multiply these two expansions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion.

Let me clarify.\n\nWait, no, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would mean that the coefficient is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all the coefficients from the second part. Because each term in the second part has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, perhaps I need to compute the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then multiply that by 6.\n\nWait, but how do I find the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial? The sum of the coefficients is found by evaluating the polynomial at \\(c = 1\\). So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, let me check if that makes sense. So, if I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a sum of coefficients equal to 64 when \\(c = 1\\). So, when I multiply these two, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, effectively scaling its coefficient by the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion. Therefore, 6 times 64 is 384. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach it another way. Let me consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, as I found earlier. So, 6 times 64 is indeed 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When I multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so in the product, it would be \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would mean that the coefficient is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those terms has a coefficient, and each contributes to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, adding all those up gives 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the product of two polynomials is such that the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term from the second polynomial that has a \\(c\\) term would not affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is a different term. So, actually, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product would only come from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial multiplied by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) in the second polynomial. Because any other term in the second polynomial would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, which would make the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I was wrong earlier, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is not 6 times 64, but just 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, that's a different approach. Let me see. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, it's only the term where the \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second part. Because any other term would involve \\(c\\) raised to some power, which would change the term. So, perhaps I was incorrect before when I thought it was 6 times 64. Instead, it's 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's compute that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, so now I'm confused because I got two different answers: 384 and 120. Which one is correct?\n\nLet me try to clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, which would make the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and \\(c^0\\) in the second part.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but that was when I considered multiplying by all terms, which would be incorrect because that would give terms involving \\(c\\), which are not part of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the correct approach is to only consider the term where \\(c^0\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), resulting in 120.\n\nLet me double-check this with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Now, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded as \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when I multiply the two expressions, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by 20 from the second expansion, giving \\(120a^2b^2\\). Any other terms would involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so they don't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, so where did I go wrong earlier when I thought it was 384? I think I confused the concept of the sum of coefficients with the specific coefficient of the constant term. The sum of coefficients is when you set all variables to 1, which gives the total sum of coefficients, but in this case, I only want the coefficient of the constant term in the second expansion, not the sum of all coefficients. So, that was my mistake. I thought that multiplying by the sum of coefficients would give me the correct result, but actually, it's only the constant term that affects the \\(a^2b^2\\) term when multiplying, because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) component. So, the correct coefficient is 120.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term), which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), i.e., \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), right? So, maybe I don't need to worry about the second part because it's multiplied by the first part, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second part evaluated at some term. Wait, that might not make sense. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term would come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part and any term in the second part. But since the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a separate variable, maybe the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is independent of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6, and the other part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\), which don't interfere with the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, let me check. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps I can treat the two parts separately. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), when expanded, gives terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, gives terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the multiplication of these two expressions would result in terms that are products of terms from each part. So, for example, a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term from the second part, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's considering only the part that doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, that might not make sense because the entire expression is a product, so unless the second part has a term that's a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), then that term would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I need to find the constant term in the second part and then multiply it by the coefficient from the first part.\n\nLet me try that approach. So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the constant term, which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let's expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} \\times 1\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term in the second part is 20.\n\nNow, since the entire expression is the product of the two parts, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, in the product, any term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part with a term from the second part that doesn't involve \\(c\\), i.e., the constant term. Therefore, the coefficient would indeed be 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. So, I think that's the correct approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and when expanding, each term in the expansion would be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{2}b^{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to sum over all terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which only happens when \\(m = 3\\), as we found earlier. Therefore, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. So, that confirms my earlier calculation.\n\nI think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\) in the expansion.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Coefficient} = \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   We look for the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0).

So, I think I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the multiplication would just be distributing each term in the first expansion across each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to consider all the terms in the second expansion. Instead, I can just take the coefficient from the first part and multiply it by the entire second part, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me think.

So, actually, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so when we multiply, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe it's considering the entire expression as a product, and the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\), so unless we're combining terms, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. It says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the entire expression. But in the entire expression, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that's multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, actually, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), perhaps that's not the case. Wait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because otherwise, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each power of \\(c\\), so it's not a single term. Hmm, that might make more sense. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be the constant term in the second expansion. So, let me check that.\n\nSo, if that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That would give me the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let me proceed with that approach.\n\nFirst, as I found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find that, I can again use the binomial theorem. Let's expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, this would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which means \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we can consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion, which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\) in the second part) gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second part. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that's separate from \\(c\\), so it would just be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would involve \\(c\\) terms, which isn't a single number. So, I think that's the correct interpretation.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, so when you multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. But that can't be right because \\(a^2b^2\\) would be part of a larger expression that includes \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's just written as \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, perhaps I should re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, maybe the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that it's considering all possible terms where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, each multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part, as I calculated earlier: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) separately and then multiply them. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, and in the second expansion, the constant term is 20. So, when you multiply them, you get 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 * 20 = 120a\u00b2b\u00b2. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed 120. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to consider all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that's not what the problem is asking for; it's asking for a numerical coefficient, so it must be considering only the constant term in \\(c\\). Therefore, I think 120 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me think of another approach. Let's consider the entire expression as a product of two polynomials. The first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the terms in the product will be combinations of the terms from each polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial by any term from the second polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering all possible terms where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which again doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my initial approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(c\\) is separate, the coefficient would indeed be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that's not what the problem is asking for; it's asking for a numerical coefficient, so maybe it's a misinterpretation on my part.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), meaning that we need to find the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a single number. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. So, that's the term I should be focusing on.\n\nTherefore, as I calculated earlier, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me think of it another way. Suppose I set \\(c = 1\\). Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Then, the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 * 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that's different from 120. Hmm, that suggests that my earlier approach might be incorrect.\n\nWait, but why is that? If I set \\(c = 1\\), I'm essentially evaluating the expression at \\(c = 1\\), which would give me the sum of all coefficients multiplied by 1. But the problem isn't asking for that; it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which might involve considering the expansion in \\(c\\) as well. So, perhaps I need to consider the entire expansion and find the specific term where \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is present.\n\nWait, so if I set \\(c = 1\\), I get the sum of all coefficients, which is different from just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, that approach might not help. Let me try another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can treat the entire expression as a product and find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which again doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) separately. The first expansion has terms up to \\(a^4b^0\\) and \\(a^0b^4\\), while the second expansion has terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\). When I multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a single number. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, and thus the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check using another method. Let's consider the multinomial theorem. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me think of this as a product of two independent expansions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient is the product of the two coefficients, which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem, which is 6. Next, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found to be 20. Multiplying these coefficients gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   To find the constant term (\\(c^0\\)), set the exponent equal to 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both expansions:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Let me compute that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. Since the two parts of the expression are multiplied together, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means we don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second. But since we are only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term would be \\(a^2b^2\\) times a term involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which seems incorrect because the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the \\(c\\) terms are separate. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, when we multiply the two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes part of the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Wait, but that seems like the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of the coefficients would be \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me verify. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) is only one term, and the rest of the expression involves \\(c\\), so the coefficient would just be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), meaning that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number. So, perhaps I was correct the first time. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem doesn't specify \\(c\\), so I think it's just 384. Wait, let me think again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges based on the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every possible term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're just asked for the coefficient, and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think the answer is 384. Wait, but let me double-check. Let me compute the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. So, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   Since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6 and the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

Because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are powers of \\(c\\).

But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that gets multiplied by 6 and then attached to \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.

Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and the second part is independent, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion.

Now, the expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so the entire expression is the product of two expansions: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part. Wait, but does the second part affect this coefficient? Let me think. When you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), not involving \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms in \\(c\\) raised to various powers, but since we're looking for a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion? Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me clarify: The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that would mean that the term from the second expansion must be 1, because any term with \\(c\\) raised to a power would make the term have \\(c\\) in it, which we don't want. So, perhaps the only term from the second expansion that contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is the constant term, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The exponent of \\(c\\) here is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the exponent to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 * 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, and it's multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion, which is 20. So, the overall coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense. Alternatively, if I think of the entire expression as the product of two polynomials, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion that don't involve \\(c\\), which in this case is just the constant term, 20. So, yeah, 120 seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that would mean that the coefficient is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that's not right either because each term in the second expression is a power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expression, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would require that the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, actually, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because that's the only term that would multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) to give a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the overall coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me make sure I understand that correctly. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanded, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, as we found earlier. Now, when we multiply this by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we'll get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(6a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), meaning that the power of \\(c\\) must be zero. So, we need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That is, the constant term. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is what we need. Let me compute that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which means \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Let me compute it correctly. \\(6! = 720\\), \\(3! = 6\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Yes, that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) times 20 (from \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Let me double-check my reasoning to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First, I expanded \\((a + b)^4\\) and found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, I considered the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and found the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, their exponents don't interfere with each other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. Yes, that makes sense. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."
