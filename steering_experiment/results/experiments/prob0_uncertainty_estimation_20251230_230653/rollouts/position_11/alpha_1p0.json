    "text": " Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nWait, but the original expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that mean I need to consider the expansion of both parts and then multiply them together? Hmm, maybe. But the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). Let me think. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), then it must come from a term in \\((a + b)^4\\) that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\) because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we found to be 6. \n\nOkay, so now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem for this. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient is 20.\n\nNow, since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part with coefficient 6 and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from the second part with coefficient 20, the combined coefficient when multiplying these two terms together is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when expanding, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only need the constant term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. \n\nHmm, let me just cross-verify. If I were to fully expand the expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from the first part, and the second part would contribute the constant term. So, yes, multiplying them together gives the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. This corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n\\[\n6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n\\]\nThe coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nSince the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part with coefficient 6 and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from the second part with coefficient 20, the combined coefficient is:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that comes only from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). The \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), right? It only affects the exponents of \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms because they won't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and I multiply it by any term from the second part, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't change. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, that doesn't seem right because the second part is a separate expansion. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach. The entire expression is the product of two binomial expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the variables are different (a, b, c), the multiplication will result in terms that are products of terms from each expansion. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I only need to consider the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and any term from the second part, because multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion will result in a term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) and some powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. Actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficients add up. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. Let me check that. The sum of the coefficients in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), because that makes each term equal to its coefficient. So, when \\(c = 1\\), \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients in the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but is that correct? Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. In this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first part, and the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by any term from the second part. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded will have terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), etc., but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it will just add different powers of \\(c\\) to \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms is indeed the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient from this part is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of the coefficients from the second part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

Since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the second part doesn't affect that term? Wait, no, because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second. But if we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then the second part must not affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). That is, the second part must be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) without changing the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, that means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second part evaluated at its constant term, because the second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't interact with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, but actually, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the other terms in the second part would be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), but since they involve \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), they don't contribute to the exponent of \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all terms in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each of those terms will have their own coefficients, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the entire coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) isn't a constant; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, actually, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term will have a coefficient, and those coefficients will add up when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but is that correct? Let me think again. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients combine. So, if I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\) which has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), and then I multiply it by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), then each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will multiply the entire \\( (a + b)^4 \\) polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the \\(6a^2b^2\\) term, when multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion, so the coefficient would be \\(6\\) times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which as I calculated before is \\(64\\). So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me check this another way. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in each part, but that doesn't make sense because the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second part, because the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a constant. That can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by any term from the second part. But since the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second part, each of which has its own coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), and their coefficients add up. So, as I calculated earlier, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but let me verify this because I'm a bit confused. Let me consider a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{2}{2} = 1\\) from the first part, and the second part is \\(c + 1/c\\). So, when I multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be 1*(1 + 1) = 2, because when I set \\(c = 1\\), the second part becomes 2, which is the sum of its coefficients. Similarly, in the original problem, the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6*64 = 384. So, yes, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64=384.\n\nWait, another way to see it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, since the second polynomial doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a constant. That doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, no, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire second part, because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6*(c + 1/c)^6, which is a polynomial, but the problem is asking for the coefficient, which should be a constant. So, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all variables. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) because otherwise, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) could be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but the problem just says \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. That would make the coefficient a constant, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I misinterpreted the problem earlier.\n\nSo, let me try that approach. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, to do this, I can consider the product of the two expansions. So, first, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) as before, and then expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nFrom \\((a + b)^4\\), the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\), as before.\n\nFrom \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), because we want the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, earlier, I thought the problem was just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), but perhaps it's actually asking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would make the coefficient a constant. So, that would mean the correct answer is 120.\n\nBut let me double-check. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would make it a constant. So, perhaps the intended interpretation is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\).\n\nGiven that, the answer would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I don't consider \\(c\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, so the coefficient would be a polynomial, not a constant. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a number, so perhaps the intended interpretation is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial, but that seems unlikely because coefficients are usually constants. So, perhaps the problem is intended to find the constant term, i.e., the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\).\n\nTherefore, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me go through the steps again to make sure.\n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nNext, expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, but that's not a constant. So, that can't be the case because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a constant.\n\nTherefore, the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\n3. Multiply these coefficients together to get 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the product of the coefficients from each part of the expression where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) match the desired term.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):** Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):** The term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. This happens when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term doesn't involve \\(c\\), does that mean we're only looking at the part of the product where the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms? Wait, that might not be accurate. Let me clarify: when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. However, in our case, the first polynomial is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in terms of \\(c\\). So, when we multiply them, the resulting terms will have both \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) parts. But the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, does that mean we're considering all the possible coefficients from the second part? Wait, no, that might not be the case. Actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part isn't a single term. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but it's in the product of two expressions: one involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other involving \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are separate from the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's actually the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expression. But that doesn't seem right because the second expression has multiple terms. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that the term doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all. But the problem didn't specify \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. Hmm, that can't be right because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a number. So, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all possible terms, but since \\(c\\) is another variable, maybe the coefficient is a term that includes \\(c\\). But that seems odd because coefficients are usually constants. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the entire expression is a product, and I'm to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, that might make sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply by each term in the second polynomial, you're effectively scaling the coefficient from the first part by each term in the second. But wait, no, that's not exactly correct. Let me think again: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. In this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product can only come from the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by any term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second polynomial. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are constants. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting me to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when the entire expression is expanded, but considering that \\(c\\) can take any value, so we might need to evaluate the coefficient in a different way. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because if you think about it, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, since each term in the second part would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But wait, that's not quite accurate. Let me try to formalize this. Let\u2019s denote \\(P = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(Q = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, the product is \\(P \\times Q\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P \\times Q\\) is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\). Because when you multiply \\(P\\) by \\(Q\\), each term in \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\(P\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\), effectively scaling it by each coefficient in \\(Q\\). Therefore, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from \\(P\\) times the sum of coefficients in \\(Q\\). So, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P = (a + b)^4\\), which we already determined is 6. Next, we need to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by evaluating the polynomial at \\(c = 1\\). So, let's compute \\(Q\\) at \\(c = 1\\): \\(Q(1) = \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\) is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\(P \\times Q\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but let me double-check that logic because I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(Q\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. So, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from \\(P\\) times the sum of coefficients from \\(Q\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Evaluating the second expression at \\(c = 1\\) gives 64, so the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I think I need to consider the expansion of both parts separately and then multiply them together. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the second part doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is in the second part for the terms that don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Wait, but actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the second part, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product would come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part and any term in the second part, right? Wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply it by any term in the second expression, which involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\). So, that means we're looking for terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., where the power of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in other words, we need to find the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when we multiply it by \\(a^2b^2\\), it will contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the constant term in the second part. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to find that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me double-check that. So, the first part gives me 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part, when expanded, has a term with \\(c^0\\) which is 20. So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by that constant term, the coefficient becomes 6 times 20, which is 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Hmm, that seems right, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives me \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Then, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives me terms with various powers of \\(c\\), and the constant term is 20. So, when I multiply these two expansions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but only the constant term in the second expansion will result in a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, yes, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120. So, I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in that reasoning.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

I'm being asked about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but the second part of the expression involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Wait, does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, maybe not directly, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) is in the second part.

But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they won't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).

Wait, no, I think I'm overcomplicating. Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Oh, wait, maybe the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but perhaps it's more about the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Or maybe the problem is just considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), so it's just 6, as I thought earlier. But that seems too simple. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider the entire product, but only the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), i.e., the constant term in the second part. Because if the second part has a term with \\(c^0\\), then when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the expansion would have terms with various powers of \\(c\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, perhaps I need to find the constant term in the second part, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that would be the only term that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, that might be the case. \n\nLet me try to think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand the product, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part, which are terms involving \\(c\\) raised to some power. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of the products of the coefficients from the first part and the coefficients from the second part, but only for the terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because if the exponent of \\(c\\) is non-zero, then the term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), which would not be just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, which is 6. \n\nSo, first, let me find the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The expansion would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the term where \\(k = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the constant term from the second part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the first part's coefficient is 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part's constant term is 20, so when you multiply them together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, giving a coefficient of 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but only the constant term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, that would be correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of the entire product as a product of two independent expansions, and when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each expansion. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nWait, but let me think again: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms that multiply together to give that specific term. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be obtained by multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part with any term from the second part, but only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero would result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nI think that's the correct approach. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

We want the term where the exponent is 0, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\).

    "text": " Let me compute that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nWait, but the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider both expansions. The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me try to expand that as well using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. \n\nNow, the original expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply these two expansions together, I'm essentially multiplying each term from the first expansion by each term from the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think I can focus on the terms from the first expansion that have \\(a^2b^2\\) and then multiply them by the entire second expansion, because the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), only \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Wait, that makes sense because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\) when multiplying. \n\nSo, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that can't be right because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients combine in a certain way. Wait, but in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, but the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term of the second expansion. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the first part, and the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), then perhaps the coefficient remains the same as in the first part, multiplied by the entire second expansion? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is a separate part. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not any term involving \\(c\\). Wait, but that can't be, because the entire expression includes both \\(a, b, c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\)? Or maybe it's a typo, but the problem says \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that seems a bit odd because \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would actually be a sum over all possible terms from the second expansion. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, that might make sense.\n\nWait, so let me clarify. If I have two expressions multiplied together, say \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\), then the coefficient of a specific term like \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\), because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible \\(c\\) terms would be the product of the two coefficients.\n\nWait, so in this case, \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(P(a, b)\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(Q(c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). So, first, let's compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\), which we already found to be 6. Then, we need to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\), which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\). So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\) into \\(Q(c)\\), I get \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but let me verify that because I might have made a mistake. So, if I have \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\), then each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\(P(a, b)\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\), each with their respective coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by each of the coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\), but since \\(Q(c)\\) is multiplied as a whole, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all terms involving \\(c\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of the coefficients of \\(Q(c)\\). \n\nWait, but that seems a bit counterintuitive. Let me think differently. Suppose I consider that the entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then that would indeed be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's correct because when you multiply polynomials, the coefficients don't just add up like that. Let me take a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion would be \\(a c + a \\times 1/c + b c + b \\times 1/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) in this product would be \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a term, not a coefficient. But coefficients are constants, so in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 1 multiplied by the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\), which is 2, so the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 2. But in reality, the expansion has terms like \\(a c\\) and \\(a \\times 1/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) is not just 2, but each term has a coefficient that depends on \\(c\\). So, maybe I was wrong earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's not specified. But in the problem statement, it's only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering \\(c\\) as a separate variable, and the coefficient would involve all the terms from \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a numerical factor, not a polynomial in \\(c\\).\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 (c + 1/c)^6\\).\" Hmm, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\((c + 1/c)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right because coefficients are supposed to be constants.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. Perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering only the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., where the exponent is zero. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\) would be the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the entire product. \n\nSo, that would mean I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply those two coefficients together. That makes more sense because then the coefficient would be a constant, not a polynomial.\n\nSo, let me try that approach. First, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Now, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in the expansion \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\), we need the term where \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 - 2m = 0 \\Rightarrow m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, that seems more reasonable. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. That would make the coefficient a constant, 120.\n\nBut let me check again. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the product would have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{6 - 2m}\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from \\(k = 2\\) in the first expansion, and then it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which would give \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, as we found earlier. So, 6 times 64 is 384.\n\nBut if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 6 times 20, which is 120. So, which interpretation is correct?\n\nLooking back at the problem statement: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" The way it's phrased, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, in the context of polynomials, when you have multiple variables, the coefficient of a specific term is the constant factor in front of that term, considering all other variables as part of the term. So, in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term, and the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that's not typical because coefficients are usually constants, not polynomials. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is implicitly asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient is a constant, which is 120. \n\nWait, maybe I should look at the problem again. It says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems odd because coefficients are constants. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that we're considering \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), and the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Let me try both approaches and see which one makes more sense.\n\nFirst approach: Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nSecond approach: Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 times 20 = 120.\n\nWhich one is correct? Let me think about how coefficients are defined. In a polynomial, the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) is the constant factor in front of that term. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying \\(c\\), it's ambiguous. But in the context of multiple variables, it's possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, perhaps the intended answer is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is considering \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) as the only variables and \\(c\\) as a constant, then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a constant. Therefore, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be a constant, 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but it's written as \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, let me check the original problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\"\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is written correctly, and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, giving 384.\n\nBut I'm still confused because in standard terminology, the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) in a polynomial with multiple variables would be a polynomial in the other variables. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6, which is 6\\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a constant.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be a constant. So, to clarify, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then the answer is 120. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then the answer is 384.\n\nBut given that the problem is written as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying \\(c\\), it's ambiguous. However, in the context of multiple-variable polynomials, it's more likely that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering \\(c\\) as a separate variable and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would be a polynomial, not a constant.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for similar problems or think about how coefficients work in multiple variables. For example, in the product of two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of a specific combination of variables would be the product of the coefficients of those terms in each polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial. So, that would be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, that makes sense because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the first polynomial, and the term \\(c^0\\) can only come from the second polynomial. So, their product would be \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), and the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct answer is 120.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. If I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c), then the product P(a, b) * Q(c) would have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{6 - 2m}\\) for various k and m. So, the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would come from k = 2 and m = 3, as we found earlier. So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3}\\) = 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), considering that \\(c\\) must be raised to the zero power, then the answer is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in Q(c), which is 64, giving 384. But in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are constants. Therefore, the problem is likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nSo, to sum up, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, then multiplying them together.\n\n1.

The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. Multiply the two coefficients:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nWait, but the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I might have to consider the second part as well. But hold on, the term we're looking for is \\(a^2b^2\\). The second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when we multiply the two expressions together, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think we can ignore the terms involving \\(c\\) because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(c\\) isn't involved in that term, maybe we don't need to consider the second part? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. So, each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the total coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because each term in the second expansion is a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. But wait, that can't be right because that would make the coefficient depend on the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a binomial expansion is found by setting the variable to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, no, I think I'm making a mistake here. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression will be multiplied by each term in the second expression, which includes different powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression multiplied by the entire second expression. But since the second expression is a polynomial in \\(c\\), each term in the product will have a term involving \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), where \\(k\\) is some exponent. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expression, you're effectively adding up all the coefficients from the second expression and multiplying by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expression is indeed 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the second expression is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which can be expanded using the binomial theorem as \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when we multiply this by the first expansion, which has terms like \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\), the product will have terms \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} \\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means we need to find all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), which we already found gives \\(k = 2\\). So, for each \\(m\\) from 0 to 6, we can pair it with \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because for each \\(m\\), the term in the second expansion is multiplied by the term in the first expansion, so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum over all possible \\(m\\). So, the total coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But wait, \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\), so the total coefficient would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. So, that seems to confirm my earlier thought.\n\nBut wait, that feels a bit counterintuitive because the second expression is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, we're treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can consider all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of what \\(c\\) is doing. So, the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first expansion for \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, that would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Let me think about it another way. Suppose I set \\(c = 1\\). Then the expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times (1 + 1)^6 = (a + b)^4 \u00d7 64\\). In this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384, which matches what I found earlier. So, that seems to confirm that the coefficient is indeed 384. Alternatively, if I didn't set \\(c = 1\\), but instead considered each term, I would still end up with the same result because each term in the second expansion is contributing its coefficient to the product when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the total coefficient is the product of the coefficients from each expansion, summed over all possible terms in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but another way to look at it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. In this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first polynomial and \\(c\\) is in the second, the variables don't interfere with each other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that's another way to see that the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which includes the second part with \\(c\\). But since \\(c\\) is a different variable, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself is just the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first expansion. So, yes, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would have to find the product of the coefficients from both expansions for that specific \\(k\\). But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), we sum over all possible \\(k\\), which is the same as summing over all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because in the first part, the expansion is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables are separate. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in the first part, and when multiplied by each term in the second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion. Because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, to put it another way, if I denote the first expansion as \\(P(a, b) = (a + b)^4\\) and the second expansion as \\(Q(c) = \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then the product \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\) will have terms where each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), you're effectively adding up all the coefficients from \\(Q(c)\\) and multiplying by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that's why the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me just check that by actually expanding both expressions. Let's take the first part: \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Now, the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nSo, the terms are:\n\n- \\(m=0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1 \\times c^6 = c^6\\)\n- \\(m=1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^4 = 6c^4\\)\n- \\(m=2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^2 = 15c^2\\)\n- \\(m=3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\\)\n- \\(m=4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(m=5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(m=6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the coefficients are 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1. The sum of these coefficients is 1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64, which confirms that the sum is indeed 64.\n\nNow, when we multiply the two expansions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which has coefficients 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6 \\times (1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1)\\), which is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me think about it differently. If I were to collect like terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) would be \\(6 \\times 1 = 6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) would be \\(6 \\times 6 = 36\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 15 = 90\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (since \\(c^0\\)) would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\) would be \\(6 \\times 15 = 90\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{-4}\\) would be \\(6 \\times 6 = 36\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\) would be \\(6 \\times 1 = 6\\). So, each of these terms has a different power of \\(c\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would just be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, if we're just looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then we have to consider all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, each multiplied by a different power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first expansion. But if we're only looking for the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\), then the coefficient is just \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, which interpretation is correct?\n\nLooking back at the problem statement: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" The way it's phrased, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which includes all powers of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that we're considering all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first expansion, which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, that seems to contradict the earlier thought where I considered only the term where \\(c^0\\). So, I'm confused now. Let me try to clarify. If the problem had specified a particular power of \\(c\\), like \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then the coefficient would be 120. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on \\(c\\), I think it's asking for the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would be 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). So, expanding this, we get \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The product would be \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). Now, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in this case, there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term because the first expansion only goes up to \\(b^2\\), and the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Wait, that's a bad example because in this case, there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term at all. Let me think of another example.\n\nSuppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). So, that's \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). Expanding, we get \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). Now, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\), it would be \\(c + 1/c\\), because \\(a\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion, which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). Wait, but in reality, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible terms, meaning that we treat \\(a^2b^2\\) as a monomial and find its coefficient regardless of the other variables. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each expansion, but since the variables are separate, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. So, that would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nBut in my earlier example, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps in the problem, since they're asking for a coefficient, which is a number, they must be considering terms where the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out, but that doesn't make sense because \\(c\\) is a separate variable.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me go back to the problem statement: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(\\text{term from first expansion} \\times \\text{term from second expansion}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes different powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient to the product when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in my earlier example, when I set \\(c = 1\\), I got the coefficient as 6 \u00d7 64 = 384, which seems to support that approach. So, perhaps that's the correct method. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384.\n\nBut let me double-check. If I consider the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present in the product with coefficients from each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6 \u00d7 1 = 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 6 \u00d7 6 = 36, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^2\\) is 6 \u00d7 15 = 90, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\) is 6 \u00d7 15 = 90, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{-4}\\) is 6 \u00d7 6 = 36, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\) is 6 \u00d7 1 = 6. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I have to add all these coefficients together: 6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6. Let me calculate that:\n\n6 + 36 = 42\n\n42 + 90 = 132\n\n132 + 120 = 252\n\n252 + 90 = 342\n\n342 + 36 = 378\n\n378 + 6 = 384\n\nSo, that confirms it. The total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but in my earlier thought process, I was confused because I thought maybe only the term where \\(c^0\\) would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\), but now I see that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so we have to sum all the contributions from each power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the correct coefficient is 384.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem, which gives terms with coefficients 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1.\n\n3. The sum of these coefficients is 64.\n\n4. Multiply the coefficient from step 1 (6) by the sum from step 3 (64) to get the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is 384.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6 using the binomial theorem. Then, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is calculated by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{384}\n\\]"

So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That suggests that maybe the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so perhaps we just need to consider the coefficient from the first part and then multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient, maybe it's just the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right because the second part is a separate expression. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. That is, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you get a product where each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are determined only by the first expansion. So, when you multiply by the second expansion, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) remain the same, but you get additional factors involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present in the product, and its coefficient will be the coefficient from the first expansion times the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion. Wait, no, that's not quite right because each term in the product is a product of terms from each expansion. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the second part doesn't affect it because the variables are different. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me try to clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, we're looking for the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m\\) or something like that. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't sound right because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is not the same as the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial. Wait, let me think again.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But is that correct? Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if you have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part with coefficient 6, and then you multiply it by each term from the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the second part has its own coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term from the second expansion contributes its own coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), right? Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives the sum of the coefficients. So, let's compute that.\n\nSo, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) evaluated at \\(c = 1\\) is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems too high. Let me check my reasoning again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think differently. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by each term from the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times each term from the second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion, which is not possible because the variables are different. Wait, no, perhaps the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire second expansion, but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), the coefficient would actually be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term on its own, and the second expansion contributes to the coefficients of \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest is part of the other terms involving \\(c\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because when you multiply, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times each coefficient from the second expansion, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), perhaps we need to consider that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But that seems to be the case because when you multiply, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^m\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^m\\) in the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), perhaps we need to sum over all possible coefficients in the second expansion, which would give us 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems high, and I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing the terms. Let me try to write it out more formally. Let me denote the first expansion as \\( (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\), and the second expansion as \\( \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m} \\). So, when we multiply these two expansions together, we get:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\right) \\left( \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m} \\right)\n\\]\n\nSo, each term in the product will be of the form \\( \\dbinom{4}{k} \\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m} \\). Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need to find all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, which occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), which happens when \\(k = 2\\). So, for each such term, the coefficient is \\( \\dbinom{4}{2} \\dbinom{6}{m} \\) multiplied by \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum over all possible \\(m\\) from 0 to 6. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\n\\]\n\nWait, that makes sense because for each \\(m\\), the term \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) has a coefficient of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), and since we're summing over all \\(m\\), the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\) is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\), so the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but that seems a bit counterintuitive because I thought the coefficient would just be 6, but I guess that's not the case because when you multiply by the second expansion, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct by considering a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\) would expand to \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), but if I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then I would have to sum over all the coefficients from the second expansion. Wait, but in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is not a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps my approach is incorrect because when variables are involved, you can't just sum the coefficients. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the question. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). In that case, the exponent of \\(c\\) must be zero, which would require \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), so the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). But the problem didn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so I'm not sure if that's the case.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without any mention of \\(c\\). So, perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), meaning that we need to sum over all possible coefficients for \\(c\\). But in the example I did earlier, that approach led to a non-integer coefficient, which doesn't make sense because coefficients should be integers. Therefore, perhaps my initial approach was wrong, and the correct way is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest of the expression is separate. But that doesn't seem right either because when you multiply, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficient would actually be 6 times the entire second expansion, which would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). In that case, we need to find the coefficient where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which would require \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), so the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). That seems more reasonable because it's a single number, and it's an integer. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe I'm supposed to consider all possible powers of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But in the example I did earlier with \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which isn't a number, so perhaps the problem is intended to have \\(c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. So, maybe the problem expects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6, as that's the coefficient from the first expansion, and the second expansion doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that seems inconsistent with the problem statement because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients get multiplied as well. So, perhaps the correct answer is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 384. But I'm not entirely sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for a different approach. Let me consider that when you have two independent variables, \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient, perhaps it's 6 times the entire second expansion, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be a number. So, in that case, we need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which requires that the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, in the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 120, assuming that the problem is asking for the coefficient where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But given that the problem didn't specify the power of \\(c\\), I think the intended answer is 120, as it's more likely that they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when combined with \\(c^0\\).\n\nWait, but let me check again. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms like \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, c^0, c^{-2}, c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\). So, when I multiply each term from the first expansion by each term from the second, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each of these \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be \\(6 \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20c^0 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\right)\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^2\\) is 6 \u00d7 15 = 90, and so on. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's not a single number, but rather a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, since the problem is asking for a coefficient, it's more likely that they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6, but that seems unlikely because when you multiply by the second expansion, the coefficients get multiplied as well. Therefore, I think the correct answer is 120, as that's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But that would mean that the coefficient is 384, and that's the number I should provide. But I'm confused because when I think about the variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is separate from \\(c\\), so the coefficient should just be 6, but that doesn't account for the multiplication by the second expansion. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to look for an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1 = a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is not a number. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^0\\) would be 0 because there's no constant term in \\(c + 1/c\\). Wait, but in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^0\\) is zero, but the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial. So, perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), and if the problem is asking for the coefficient as a number, then it's expecting the coefficient when combined with \\(c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the variables separate, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest is part of the other variables. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, the coefficients multiply as well. Therefore, I think the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely confident because in the example I did earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) was a polynomial, not a number, which suggests that the problem is asking for a specific term where \\(c\\) is also at a certain power.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c)^4\\), but that's just a guess. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Given that, I think 120 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, let me compute \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) to confirm. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term where \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) is when \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when we multiply by the coefficient from the first expansion, which is 6, we get 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. Since the problem didn't specify the power of \\(c\\), but it's common in such problems to assume the term where the variables cancel out, I think the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me consider both interpretations:\n\n1. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\n2. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nGiven that the problem didn't specify \\(c\\), it's ambiguous, but I think the intended answer is 120, as it's more likely that they want the term where \\(c\\) cancels out.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it's written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, perhaps the variables are separate, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest is part of the other terms. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number, which contradicts the problem's phrasing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in the example I did earlier with \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as a number, it must be referring to the coefficient when combined with a specific power of \\(c\\), probably \\(c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify \\(c\\), so perhaps the intended answer is 120, as that's the coefficient when \\(c\\) is at power zero. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, and the second part is meant to be multiplied by \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), but as it stands, I think the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but I'm still unsure. Let me try to see if there's another way to approach this. If I treat the entire expression as a product of two polynomials, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all possible products where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). But since the exponents of \\(c\\) are independent, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be the coefficient from the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in the example I did earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) was a polynomial, not a number, which suggests that when variables are involved, the coefficient can't be a single number unless you specify the power of the other variables. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to have \\(c^0\\), making the coefficient 120.\n\nI think I need to make a decision here. Given that the problem didn't specify \\(c\\), but it's common in such problems to consider the term where the other variables cancel out, I think the intended answer is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but I'm still confused because in the expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, leading to coefficients involving \\(c\\). So, unless the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120, the answer would be a polynomial. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for 120.\n\nWait, but let me check with another example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, I get \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2ab c + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0c^0\\) is 0. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 0. The coefficient of \\(a^1b^1c^0\\) is 2. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^1c^0\\) is 2, which is the product of the coefficients from each expansion where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out.\n\nTherefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120, which is the product of 6 (from the first expansion) and 20 (from the second expansion where \\(c^0\\) is considered). Therefore, the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but I'm still not entirely sure. Let me try to compute the entire product to see if that's the case. But that might take too long, but perhaps I can compute specific terms. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the multinomial theorem or generating functions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a product of two independent polynomials, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. However, in the example I did earlier, that approach led to a non-integer coefficient when variables were involved, which suggests that it's not correct. Therefore, I think the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120, which is the intended answer.\n\nAfter all this thinking, I believe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. \n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. Next, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20. Multiplying these coefficients gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. But wait, the original expression is the product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply these two together, the terms from each expansion will multiply each other. But since the problem is asking only for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think I don't need to consider the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, that's not right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, to get a term that only has \\(a^2b^2\\), I would need to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion by a term that has \\(c^0\\) (since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\)) in the second expansion. So, the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponents of \\(c\\) will be \\(6 - 2m\\), where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. Now, to get a term with \\(c^0\\), which is 1, we need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(2m = 6\\), which means \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\), which is just \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} \\times 1 = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, when I multiply the two expansions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion (which has coefficient 6) is multiplied by the 20 from the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two terms together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is multiplied by 20, giving 120 as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Hmm, that seems right. Let me double-check the binomial coefficients. For the first part, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, correct. For the second part, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20, correct. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. I think that's the answer. Wait, but let me consider if there are any other terms that might contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). For example, could there be a term from the second expansion that has \\(c\\) raised to some power, but when multiplied by another term, still results in a term without \\(c\\)? But no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so it can only come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by the constant term from the second expansion. So, yeah, I think 120 is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20.

Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product.

Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, when you multiply the two expressions, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\), but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that can't be right because the coefficient is a number, not a polynomial. Wait, perhaps the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems a bit odd because usually, when you're asked for a coefficient, it's in terms of all variables, but maybe it's just the numerical coefficient, ignoring the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me try to clarify. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanded, it will have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) and similar terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But if the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems complicated, and I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), or perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be the constant term. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make much sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial, not a single number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), that is, the constant term in \\(c\\). That would make more sense because then the coefficient would be a single number. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the product. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, it doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems too broad. Alternatively, maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then the second part is multiplied as a whole, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical answer. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. Since the variables \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\) are separate, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the expansion of the second part. But that doesn't seem right because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), that is, the constant term in \\(c\\). So, to find that, I would need to compute 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me check that approach. So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. Then, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the exponent \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(6 = 2m\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term in the second part is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 times 20, which is 120. So, the answer would be 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm interpreting the question correctly. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems odd because the problem is likely expecting a numerical answer. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), which would be 120 as I calculated. That seems more reasonable. So, to confirm, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the constant term of the second part, which is 20, giving 120. Alternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, then it would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would result in a polynomial, not a single number. Since the problem is presented as a single answer, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), which is 120. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{120}"

Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the term \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, right? Because the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables from \\(c\\), the product terms will have \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) parts. However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means we're only interested in the part of the product where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the same as the coefficient in the first part, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, it will just append the \\(c\\) terms, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we don't care about the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, it's actually the sum of all the coefficients from the second part multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. Wait, no, that's not correct either. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and when you multiply it by any term from the second part, you get \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) (something with \\(c\\)). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean we are considering the coefficient in the entire expansion, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all the terms from the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from the second part. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is a separate variable. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me approach it differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). We need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, when we multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that we are looking for the part of the expansion where the variables are exactly \\(a^2b^2\\), and the rest are other variables. But wait, that's not possible because the second part introduces \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would have those \\(c\\) terms attached. Therefore, unless the second part also has a term with \\(c^0\\), which is 1, then \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by 1, giving just \\(a^2b^2\\), and its coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. Wait, that makes sense. So, if the second expansion \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, then that term is 1, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would give \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the final answer should be 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, first, I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) correctly as 6. Then, I realized that to get the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, it must be multiplied by the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, I correctly found that the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in that expansion is 20. Multiplying 6 by 20 gives 120, which seems correct. Yeah, I think that's right.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The term \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient of 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I suppose that when we multiply the two expressions together, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is part of the first expansion, perhaps the second expansion doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). Wait, that might not be the case. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and then when multiplied by any term from the second part, which is in terms of \\(c\\), it would just add an exponent of \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\) to the term.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficients would add up when the variables match. But in this case, the variables are different. The first part has \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part has \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, but since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are distinct variables, the only way a term could have \\(a^2b^2\\) is if it's multiplied by \\(c^k\\) or something, but \\(a^2b^2\\) itself doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms. So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion? Wait, that doesn't sound right because the second expansion is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so when you multiply, each term in \\(a + b\\) expansion is multiplied by each term in \\(c + 1/c\\), but \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be a term in the product, but it's not combined with any \\(c\\) terms, so perhaps the coefficient remains as 6. Wait, but that seems too simple. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But wait, no, that's not correct either. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second polynomial. But that's not possible because the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\), so it's a separate variable. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that can't be right because the product would have terms in both \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would just be the sum of all the coefficients from the second part multiplied by 6. Wait, that makes more sense. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term would have a coefficient, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, when you expand the entire product, you can have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients is indeed found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives 2^6 = 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me check this again because I might be making a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is not asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), but just \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But I'm not entirely sure if that's the correct interpretation. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you have two separate variables, the coefficient of a term in one variable doesn't depend on the other variable's expansion. So, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one variable is multiplied by the entire expansion of the other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Since the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64, as calculated before, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with a different approach. Let's consider the entire product: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply by each term in the second polynomial, you're effectively scaling the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by each coefficient in the second polynomial. So, the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is indeed 2^6 = 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, without considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would just be 6, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that seems unlikely because when you multiply by the second polynomial, each term in the first polynomial is scaled by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire second polynomial. But I think that's not correct because the coefficient should be a single number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). So, in that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the product. So, that would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nAh, that makes more sense. So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. So, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find that, we can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that seems more reasonable. So, I think I made a mistake earlier by considering the sum of all coefficients, but actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nLet me recap:\n\n1.

Wait, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, if I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, and the second part could contribute any term, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. \n\nWait, actually, when you have a product of two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will only come from the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by each term in the second part. Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire sum of the coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But that can't be right because the second part has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so the product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\), etc. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the problem is treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, and it's only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that means we have to consider all possible terms where the exponent of \\(a\\) is 2 and the exponent of \\(b\\) is 2, and the exponents of \\(c\\) can be anything. So, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, that might be the case. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so we have to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in the first part is being multiplied by each term in the second part, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each contributing a different power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), that would mean that the coefficient is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nWait, but let me verify this. Let me think of it as multiplying two polynomials. The first polynomial is in variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part because each term in the second part is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\), etc. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then you would sum all those coefficients. So, the coefficient would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nWait, but how do I find the sum of all coefficients in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? The sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the second part is a Laurent polynomial, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in the first part, but multiplied by each term in the second part, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's equivalent to multiplying by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). So, expanding, we get \\(a c + a \\cdot 1/c + b c + b \\cdot 1/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) in this product would be the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first part, which is 1, multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 2, and similarly for \\(b\\). So, that seems to check out. Therefore, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything else. Let me consider the entire expansion. The first part is \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply them, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, as we found earlier. So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but perhaps I should double-check the sum of coefficients in the second part. Let me compute \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) evaluated at \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\), which matches what I had before. So, that seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about the problem differently. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's the same as treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable and just multiplying the coefficients. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have multiple variables, the coefficients can interact in more complex ways, but in this case, since the second polynomial doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's just a scalar multiple when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think my approach is correct. \n\nLet me summarize: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) to see what the sum of coefficients is. Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\cdot (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for each term. The sum of all coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\), which confirms our earlier result. \n\nTherefore, I can be confident that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem and consider the contributions from each part of the product.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   Thus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " Let me calculate that. The binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I think I need to expand this as well, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) will just be multiplied by the coefficient from the first part, and they won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second. But since the first part is only in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part is only in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), maybe the coefficients from the second part don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Hmm, that seems confusing. Let me think again. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two expansions together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) won't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because when you multiply, you have to consider each term. But actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it's multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), maybe we can ignore the second part? That doesn't seem correct. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), so we just take the coefficient from the first part and multiply it by the entire second expansion. But that would give us a sum of terms involving different powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). So, maybe the coefficient is just 6, regardless of the second part. Wait, that seems too simple. Let me check. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all the terms, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But that seems off because the second expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), so their coefficients would add up when multiplied by 6. Wait, but if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the sum of all coefficients in a binomial expansion \\((x + y)^n\\) is found by setting \\(x = 1\\) and \\(y = 1\\), so here, setting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first part, and the second part is multiplied as a whole, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm a bit confused because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve all possible terms from the second expansion. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then yes, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second expansion would be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. So, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64, as calculated by setting \\(c = 1\\). Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would require considering the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems plausible. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which would be 6 * 64 = 384.

    "text": " Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6, and the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). \n\nNow, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think the next step is to consider how these two parts interact. Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is part of the first binomial expansion, I need to see how it combines with the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when we multiply the two expansions together, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. However, since the variables are different, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if it's multiplied by a term that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), right? Because otherwise, the term would have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) raised to some power, which we don't want. So, that means we need to find the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The constant term is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because \\(c^0 = 1\\), which is just a constant. \n\nSo, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) which means \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. \n\nNow, putting it all together. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion has a coefficient of 6, and it gets multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait a second, let me double-check that. So, the first part's coefficient is 6, and the second part's constant term is 20, so when multiplied, it's 120. That seems right. I don't think I made a mistake in the binomial coefficients. Let me just verify the binomial coefficients again. For \\((a + b)^4\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is indeed 6. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20, so that's correct. Multiplying them gives 120. So, yeah, I think that's the right answer. \n\nI don't think I need to consider any other terms because \\(a^2b^2\\) can't come from any other terms in the expansion unless there's a cross term involving \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), but since the second part only involves \\(c\\), multiplying by any term there won't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the only contribution to \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the constant term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. \n\nI think that's it. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20.

Wait, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so maybe the coefficient is just 6 times whatever comes from the second part? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent on \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the exponent to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and it's multiplied by the constant term 20 from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Is there a possibility that other terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) could contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term when multiplied by other terms in \\((a + b)^4\\)? Hmm, no, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so any term involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) would introduce those variables into the product, which would change the term from \\(a^2b^2\\) to something else. So, only the constant term from the second polynomial will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial, contributing to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think I'm correct in multiplying 6 and 20 to get 120. Let me just write it out again to make sure: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two parts together, the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations. The binomial coefficients are correct, and the reasoning about the constant term makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe are interested in the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we consider the expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

    "text": " Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) part is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), does that mean the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part? But that seems like it would involve \\(c\\) terms. But wait, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what happens with \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the first part, and it's multiplied by the entire second part. But the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), so unless the second part has a term with \\(c^0\\), which is 1, the product would have terms involving \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering the entire expression as a product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the coefficient should be a constant, not a polynomial in \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, perhaps the problem is treating \\(c\\) as a variable independent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expansion, but since \\(c\\) is another variable, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, so \\(c^0\\), and then the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That might make sense. Let me check that. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6, multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then the overall coefficient would be 6 times that. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 20, which is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), that term would be \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which should be a constant, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0, respectively. That makes more sense. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) from the second part, which is 20, giving 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Alternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"
