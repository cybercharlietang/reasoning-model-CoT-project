    "text": " Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part. Now, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, that's another binomial expression. But wait, the problem is asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The second part is in terms of \\(c\\), so it doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, does that mean I can treat the second part separately and then just multiply the coefficients? Wait, let me think. Since the two parts are multiplied together, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, and the second part involves \\(c\\) terms, which don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because when you multiply, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. But since the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product will only come from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part multiplied by the entire second part. So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that seems too broad. The problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product. But in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or something like that, depending on the exponents. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the variables are separate. So, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are independent of the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that can't be right because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the question is just asking for a numerical coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product, and looking for the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient would include all the terms from the second part. But that seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and the second part is just a scalar multiple. Wait, no, the second part is a binomial expression with terms in \\(c\\), so it's not a scalar. Hmm, this is confusing. Let me try to approach it differently. Let me consider the entire product: \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6\\) (the coefficient from the first part) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like it's not a single coefficient but rather a polynomial. Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make much sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the part of the product that has \\(a^2b^2\\) and any powers of \\(c\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't seem right. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, in the product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Wait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of the entire product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) and ignoring the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that also doesn't seem right because the sum of coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\), but that's not necessarily what's being asked. Hmm, maybe I need to clarify. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, which includes terms with \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the second part. So, the coefficient would be 6 times each term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial. Hmm, I'm confused. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^{10}\\) or something like that, but no, it's \\((a + b)^4 (c + 1/c)^6\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, but that's not specified. Hmm, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that the \\(c\\) terms are separate, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical value. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by terms that don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). But that doesn't make sense because the entire product is \\((a + b)^4 (c + 1/c)^6\\), so each term in the product will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms multiplied by \\(c\\) terms. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product will be multiplied by each term from the second part, so the coefficient would be 6 times each term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of the entire expression, considering all variables, but that seems unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. That might make sense. So, let me try that approach. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, that would mean I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That makes sense because then the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, let's proceed with that. First, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 times 20, which is 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (assuming we're looking for the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., \\(c^0\\)) is 120. Alternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the problem is likely expecting a numerical value. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the contributions from each part of the product.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   - The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   - We seek the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term), which occurs when \\(m = 3\\).\n   - The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   - The overall coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6 for the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part.\n\nNow, the expression also includes \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm supposed to multiply this by \\((a + b)^4\\), so the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they're multiplied by the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, actually, the \\(c\\) part will just contribute a scalar factor when considering the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, I think the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 times the coefficient of the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the constant term (which is the term with \\(c^0\\)) will be the only one that doesn't change the exponent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nLet me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, I'm looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient should be 120.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\) has a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a constant term (the term without \\(c\\)) which is 20. So when you multiply these two parts together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by 20, giving 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about the entire expansion. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\), which is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2. Then, the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms like \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when I multiply 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 by each term in the second expansion, I get terms like 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to find all the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, no, because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, in the entire expression, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the terms that contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) are those where the term from the first expansion is \\(a^2b^2\\) and the term from the second expansion is any term. But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply the two polynomials, each term is a product, so \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient in the first part, because the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), it just scales that term by each coefficient in the second polynomial. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, but that's not correct because each term in the second polynomial is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, that's not right either because the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a separate variable. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times the constant term in the second polynomial, which is 20, giving 120. Because when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the only term that doesn't change the exponent of \\(c\\) is the constant term. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but only the constant term contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. The other terms would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, so they would contribute to other terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but not to \\(a^2b^2\\) itself. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one part is multiplied by the sum of all terms in the other part. But no, that's not correct because each term is a product of terms from each polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, but that would be if the second part was a polynomial in variables that are separate, so when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. But that's not correct because the second polynomial is in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are separate variables. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. But wait, the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is when you set \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. So, would the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) be 6 * 64 = 384? But that contradicts my earlier conclusion of 120. Hmm, so which one is correct?\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing two different concepts here. Let me clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^k b^{4 - k} \\times c^m / c^n\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are such that \\(m - n\\) is the exponent from the second polynomial. But when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we're only looking at the term where \\(k = 2\\), so the term is \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second polynomial. So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just scaling that term by the coefficient. So, the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is indeed when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that contradicts my earlier thought where I considered only the constant term. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, no, I think I made a mistake in the earlier reasoning. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, each term is a coefficient times \\(c^m\\). So, when you collect like terms, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient equal to the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial is a separate term when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, for example, \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^6\\) is one term, \\(a^2b^2 \\times 6c^4\\) is another, etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only include the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero. So, that's just the constant term from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 20, which is 120. So, my initial thought was correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\), when I expand it, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when considering the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), that occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Then, the second part can have any exponent of \\(c\\), but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just a separate term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384, because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), which is 2^6 = 64. But that seems too high, and I think I'm confusing two different concepts here.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), you're only considering the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, each of which has a coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part (6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because each term in the second part is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they become separate terms. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all those coefficients multiplied by 6. So, the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is 2^6 = 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier conclusion where I thought only the constant term contributes. So, which one is correct? Let me think carefully. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the product is a term from the first polynomial times a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, each of which is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial because each term in the second polynomial contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is indeed 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, that seems high, and I'm confused because earlier I thought only the constant term contributes. Let me check with a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion is \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 2. So, 1 * 2 = 2. But if I look at the product, it's \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 times (1 + 1) = 2, which matches. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) is 1 times (1 + 1) = 2. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, which is the coefficient from the first part (1) times the sum of coefficients in the second part (2). So, in this case, it works out. Therefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) should be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), whose sum of coefficients is 2^6 = 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. But earlier, I thought it was 120 by considering only the constant term. So, which one is correct? Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. That means, in the expanded form, how many times does \\(a^2b^2\\) appear, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). So, each term in the product is a term from the first polynomial times a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, each of which has a coefficient. Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems to contradict the earlier approach where I considered only the constant term. So, where is the confusion? Let me clarify: the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be present in multiple terms, each multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by 6. So, the coefficient is 6 * (sum of coefficients in second polynomial) = 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in the first approach, I considered only the constant term, which gave me 120. So, which is correct? Let me think about the product again. When you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the product is a term from the first polynomial times a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which includes all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems inconsistent with my earlier thought where I considered only the constant term. So, perhaps I was wrong earlier, and the correct answer is 384. Let me verify this with a simpler example to see which approach is correct.\n\nSuppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion is \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the product is 1 * (1 + 1) = 2, because \\(a^2\\) is multiplied by both \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so the coefficient is 1 * (1 + 1) = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 2 * (1 + 1) = 4, and the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) is 1 * (1 + 1) = 2. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 2, which is 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial (which is 2). So, in this case, the approach where you multiply the coefficient from the first polynomial by the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial works.\n\nSimilarly, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384. Therefore, the correct answer should be 384.\n\nWait, but in my initial approach, I thought that only the constant term contributes because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term, you get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. But actually, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by 6. So, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems to make sense because each term in the second polynomial contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial. So, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but then why did I initially think it was 120? Because I was considering only the constant term, which gives the term \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). So, actually, all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by 6. So, yes, 384 is correct.\n\nBut wait, let me check the problem again. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, each of which has a coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but now I'm confused because earlier I thought it was 120 by considering only the constant term. So, perhaps I need to clarify this point. Let me consider a simpler example again. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The product is \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). Now, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 (from \\(a c\\)) + 1 (from \\(a/c\\)) = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) is 1 (from \\(b c\\)) + 1 (from \\(b/c\\)) = 2. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, which is 1 (from the first polynomial) times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial (which is 2). Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) is 2.\n\nSo, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384. Therefore, the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm now contradicting my initial approach. So, which is correct? Let me think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in multiple terms, each multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by the coefficient from the first polynomial. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 * 20 = 120. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, in the product, each term is a combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by 6. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems to be the case. So, perhaps my initial approach was wrong, and the correct answer is 384. Let me confirm this.\n\nWait, no, actually, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which has various exponents of \\(c\\). Therefore, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in multiple terms, each with a different exponent of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by the coefficient from the first polynomial. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems too large, and I think I'm confusing the concept of coefficients in multivariable polynomials. Let me try to think differently. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as the coefficient in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to consider only the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, i.e., the constant term. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). Therefore, the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check another example to be sure. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). The expansion is \\((a + b)(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1*(1 + 2 + 1) = 4, because \\(a\\) is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) is also 4. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 4, which is 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial (which is 4). So, that works.\n\nSimilarly, in the original problem, the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, after careful consideration, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still confused because in my initial approach, I thought only the constant term contributed, but now I'm seeing that all terms contribute. So, perhaps the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but to be thorough, let me compute the product step by step.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nSecond, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply these two polynomials together, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in:\n\n6a\u00b2b\u00b2 * c^6 + 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 * 6c^4 + 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 * 15c^2 + 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 * 20 + 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 * 15/c^2 + 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 * 6/c^4 + 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 * 1/c^6.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by 6. That is, 6*(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6*(64) = 384.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 120. So, where was I wrong? I think the confusion was whether the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) or just \\(a^2b^2\\). Since the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). Therefore, the correct answer is 384.\n\nBut now I'm really confused because I initially thought it was 120, but after careful analysis, it's 384. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach by considering only the constant term, but the correct approach is to consider all terms, leading to 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". In the product, each term is a product of a term from the first polynomial and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, each of which has a coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by the coefficient from the first polynomial. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, after careful consideration, I conclude that the coefficient is 384.\n\nBut wait, I just realized something. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the product would be present in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, each of these terms has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but to confirm, let me compute the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial. \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) evaluated at \\(c = 1\\) is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Therefore, the final answer is 384.\n\nBut wait, I just realized that in the initial problem, the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all independent variables. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by the coefficient from the first polynomial. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, after careful consideration, I conclude that the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still unsure because earlier I thought it was 120. Let me check with another example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). The expansion is \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 1*(1 + 2 + 1) = 4. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 2*(1 + 2 + 1) = 8, and the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) is 1*(1 + 2 + 1) = 4. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 4, which is 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 4. So, that works.\n\nSimilarly, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but now I'm really confused because I thought earlier that only the constant term contributes, but now I'm convinced that the correct answer is 384. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach by considering only the constant term, but the correct approach is to consider all terms, leading to 384.\n\nBut wait, let me think about it differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the product would be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient is the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by 6. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Therefore, the correct answer is 384.\n\nBut wait, I just realized that the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, it's a product of two separate polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). Therefore, when you multiply them, the variables are independent, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nTherefore, after careful consideration, I conclude that the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but now I'm really confused because I initially thought it was 120, but after verifying with examples and considering the problem structure, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nBut wait, let me check the problem again. It says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). Therefore, in the product, each term where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is the coefficient from the first polynomial times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which"

    "text": " Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6 for the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part. \n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm not sure how this relates to \\(a^2b^2\\) because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are different variables. Wait, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the other terms. So, perhaps I need to consider the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficients would be multiplied. Wait, no, because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply, but the variables multiply as well. But since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times whatever the constant term is in the second expansion. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term in the second expansion, the variables would still be \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, making it a constant term. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nLet me check that. So, if I consider \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can expand this using the binomial theorem as well. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that would be the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), \\(6 = 2k\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of the constant term in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the first part gives me 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives me 20 for the constant term, so when I multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, giving me 120 as the coefficient. That seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by all terms from the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that would mean that all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion would contribute to the coefficient. Wait, but that can't be right because the variables are different. So, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would be the product of the coefficients from each part. But since the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient is just 6 multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion has multiple terms. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this product, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or something like that. But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from the first part, and it would be multiplied by each term in the second part. However, since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that would mean that each term in the product that has \\(a^2b^2\\) would contribute to the coefficient. But that would be an infinite number of terms unless we're considering the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, making it a constant term. So, maybe the problem is implicitly asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the constant term in the entire expression. \n\nIf that's the case, then the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which we found as 6 and 20, respectively, giving 120. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would result in a polynomial where each term has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a term in \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient, perhaps it's only considering the constant term, so the answer is 120. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, I'll go with 120 as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).

I need to consider how this affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, their coefficients won't be affected by the second part's expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the first part, and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), maybe the coefficient remains 6.

Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that we need to consider the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out, so that the term is just a constant. Because if we're looking for a term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\), then the other part of the expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), would contribute a term that's a constant, i.e., \\(c^0\\), so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just a scalar coefficient.

Because if I just take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, which includes various powers of \\(c\\), but the problem is probably asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that we need to consider all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, each multiplied by a term from the second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not an expression.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the expression is a product of two polynomials. So, when you expand the product, each term will be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by some term from the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just 6, and the rest of the terms are in \\(c\\). Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion. But that's not correct because the coefficient would then be 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), which seems too large.\n\nWait, no, that's not the case. Let me think again. When you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first polynomial, so when you multiply by the second polynomial, each term in the second polynomial will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) can be from -6 to 6. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply that we're considering all terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, i.e., the constant term. Because if we're just looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms, then we need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I found earlier. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me compute that.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part) gives 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the first part gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives 20 for \\(c^0\\), so when you multiply these, you get 120 as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that should be the answer.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't consider the \\(c^0\\) part, I might have thought the coefficient is just 6, but that would be incorrect because the problem is in the product of both expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is influenced by the constant term in the second expansion. Therefore, the correct coefficient is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's it. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is only in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). Wait, does that mean the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, maybe not directly because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is in the second part for the term that's multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first expression, and it's being multiplied by all the terms in the second expression, which involve \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, you have to consider all possible products. Wait, no, actually, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that's independent of \\(c\\), so when you multiply it by any term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), it will create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is the exponent from the second part. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Wait, but that's not right because each term in the second expansion is a power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those, you get different terms. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if it's multiplied by 1, i.e., the term in the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. \n\nSo, let me check that. The second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the coefficient from the second part, which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the first part gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and the second part gives a term with \\(c^0\\) which is 1, with coefficient 20. So, when I multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the entire expansion. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand both, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that term must come from \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the term in the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nLet me double-check the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems right. \n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here.

So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nNow, the original expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but wait, in the second part of the product, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), there are terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the coefficient? Hmm, that seems confusing. Let me think again. \n\nWait, no, actually, the expression is the product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them together, each term in the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are different variables, the only way to get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial by the constant term from the second polynomial. Because if you multiply by any other term in the second polynomial, you would end up with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), which aren't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nOkay, so how do I find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Again, I can use the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nI need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\).

When you multiply these two parts, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20, giving \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).

But the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean I only need to consider the part of the expansion that affects \\(a^2b^2\\)? Because the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), will contribute terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since we're looking for a term that only has \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe we can treat the two parts separately. Let me think. When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, in this case, every term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that means we need to find the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that are constants, i.e., terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a constant term from the second part, it will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. If the term from the second part had a positive or negative exponent of \\(c\\), then when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would result in a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), which isn't what we want. So, to get the pure \\(a^2b^2\\) term, we need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the constant term, I can again use the binomial theorem. Let's write out the expansion: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\) which implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).

Actually, 6! is 720, and 3! is 6, so 720 divided by (6 \u00d7 6) is 720/36, which is indeed 20. So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes here. So, the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\), coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. The second part: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), constant term is 20.

Hmm, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, so maybe the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think.

Because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expression. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the second part is a sum of terms, so actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, no, that can't be right because each term in the product would have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the entire sum of the coefficients from the second part. But wait, no, that's not correct either because the second part is a separate expansion. Let me clarify. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems like it's not correct because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think differently. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression involving \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. That is, the term where \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) combine to give a constant term, which is \\(c^0\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would involve both parts. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, and then multiply them together. That makes more sense. Let me check that. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, in the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term we're interested in. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). How do I do that? Well, again, using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Now, since the entire expression is the product of the two parts, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, that would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through it again. The first part: \\((a + b)^4\\), coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The second part: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, multiplying these together, 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I should think of the entire expression as a product of two expansions, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from the first part, and it would be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on \\(c\\), that might not be the case. Wait, but in the problem statement, it's written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by all the terms in the second part, each of which is a power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, but that can't be right because the sum of all coefficients in the second part is when \\(c = 1\\), which would be \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, if I take 6 * 64, that would be 384, which is much larger than 120. But that seems incorrect because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). So, perhaps I was wrong earlier. Maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. That doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. So, that would require both parts contributing to the term. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120, as I found earlier. So, I think that's the correct answer. Let me just confirm once more. The first part: \\((a + b)^4\\), coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. The second part: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiply them together: 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Yeah, that seems right.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the contributions from each part of the product.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**  \n   Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**  \n   The term with \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.

So, I think I need to consider both parts. However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all terms in the second part. Wait, no, because each term in the product will be a combination of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would actually be a coefficient that includes all the possible coefficients from the second part. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is not correct because the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other variables are separate. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since they don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), when you multiply, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, meaning that in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the sum of coefficients in the second expansion would be when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\), \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the other terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate. Wait, no, because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, that can't be because \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the product, and each term in the product would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot c^{-k}\\), etc. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, as I thought before. So, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Let me verify that. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6, and the rest of the terms would involve \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just 6. Wait, that seems more plausible. Because in the product, each term is a combination of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), so the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) as separate variables, so the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of each term in the second expansion. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me think differently. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which only comes from the first polynomial. The second polynomial has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since they don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. As I thought before, the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is when \\(c = 1\\), so it's \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of the second polynomial. So, the coefficient would be 6 * \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's not a constant; it's a polynomial. Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms from the second expansion. So, the coefficient is 6 * \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's not a numerical coefficient; it's an expression. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of the second part. But that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. So, that would require finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. That makes more sense. So, let me try that approach.\n\nFirst, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) would give \\(a^2b^2\\), and that's what the problem is asking for. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find the constant term, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, the problem is likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, the answer is 120.\n\nLet me recap:\n\n1. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\): it's 6.\n2. Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\): it's 20.\n3. Multiply them together: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting the exponent of \\(c\\) to zero, which occurs when \\(k = 3\\), giving a coefficient of 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the question is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Does the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, maybe not directly because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when we multiply the two expressions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the other terms must involve \\(c\\) raised to some power. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that might not be right. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, the coefficients of the product are the products of the coefficients of the individual terms. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first part, and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\) will be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, is that correct? Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second part, each term will have a different power of \\(c\\), but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself doesn't involve \\(c\\), so each multiplication will give a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) times a term in \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But wait, that might not be accurate because the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering any \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try another approach. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and to get the coefficient, we need to multiply it by the sum of all the terms from the second part, because each term in the second part will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second part. So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). Let me check that: if \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients from the second part), which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the second part could contribute a term that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives a term without \\(c\\), but that's not possible because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables. So, unless the second part has a term with \\(c^0\\), which would be the constant term, but in that case, the coefficient would be just the constant term, not the sum of all coefficients. Wait, so maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me correct that. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part times the coefficient from the second part that's a constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)). Because if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\), the term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but if we're looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), then \\(k\\) must be zero. So, the coefficient is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's compute that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Therefore, the constant term is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), which equals 120. Wait, that makes more sense. So, earlier I thought it was 384, but that was because I mistakenly multiplied by the sum of all coefficients, which is 64, but actually, only the constant term contributes to the term \\(a^2b^2\\) because otherwise, you'd have a \\(c\\) term attached to it. So, the correct coefficient should be 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Let me double-check this. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions, so each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would be if we were considering the entire product without any restriction on \\(c\\). But in reality, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But now I'm confused because earlier I thought it should be 120. Wait, which is it? Let me clarify the problem statement again. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, does this mean we're considering the entire expression as a polynomial in variables \\(a, b, c\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\)? Or are we only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\)? The wording is a bit ambiguous, but I think in the context of such problems, when they ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), they're considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. But that contradicts my earlier thought where I thought only the constant term contributes. Hmm, maybe I need to approach this differently. Let me consider that the entire expression is a product, so each term in the product is a combination of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and when multiplied by any term from the second part, it will have the form \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is some integer. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each coefficient in the second part contributes to a different power of \\(c\\), but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same regardless of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But that seems high, and I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering any \\(c\\) terms, meaning that \\(c\\) must also be raised to the zero power. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. To resolve this, maybe I should look at the problem again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Since \\(c\\) is another variable, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be part of the product only if it's multiplied by \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, it would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is a different term. So, if we're strictly looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20, giving 120. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to think of a simpler example to test this. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). So, expanding, it's \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 (from \\((a + b)\\)) multiplied by the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\), which is 2 (since \\(c + 1/c\\) has coefficients 1 and 1). So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 \u00d7 2 = 2. Alternatively, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^0\\), then it would be 1 \u00d7 1 = 1, because the constant term in \\((c + 1/c)\\) is 0, but wait, actually, \\((c + 1/c)\\) doesn't have a constant term. Wait, that's a problem. So, in this case, the term \\(a^1b^0c^0\\) doesn't exist, so its coefficient is 0. Hmm, so maybe in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120, but if we consider all possible \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which typically would refer to the coefficient when considering all possible terms, regardless of other variables. So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384, because each term in the second expansion contributes to a term with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), and the coefficient is the sum of all those contributions. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering \\(a^2b^2\\) as a term in the product, regardless of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Wait, perhaps I should look up how such coefficients are defined. Typically, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) in a product of polynomials, you're supposed to consider all possible exponents of the other variables. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all \\(k\\) of (coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\)) in the product. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384, as each term in the second expansion contributes to a different power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same across all those terms. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of \\(c\\), meaning that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient is indeed 384. But I'm still not entirely confident. Let me try another approach. Let's expand both parts separately and see how the terms combine. First, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) here is 6. Now, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\cdot c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\). The coefficients here are 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1 for exponents 6, 4, 2, 0, -2, -4, -6 respectively. Now, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(15a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(20a^2b^2\\), \\(15a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), and \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all these coefficients, because each multiplication by a term in the second expansion adds a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by that coefficient. So, the coefficient is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But wait, that seems to contradict my earlier thought where I considered only the constant term. So, I think this approach is correct because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those terms contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, the total coefficient is indeed 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384. I think this makes sense now. So, the final answer should be 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think I can ignore the second part because it doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me think. The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded will have terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but none involving \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. However, since the second expansion doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because when you multiply by the second expansion, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Wait, but the entire product is a product of two polynomials, so each term in the product will be a term from the first polynomial times a term from the second polynomial. But since the second polynomial doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will only come from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But wait, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So, does that mean we're considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\)? Or are we supposed to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some specific power of \\(c\\)? Wait, the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the entire expression. So, in the product, each term will be of the form \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some integer \\(k\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think that would be the sum of all coefficients where the term is \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be a single number, not multiplied by a series of terms. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, the sum of coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too large. Let me check my reasoning again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the second part is a separate polynomial, when you multiply the two polynomials together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the question. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem didn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, meaning the coefficient is a numerical value, regardless of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible exponents of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems more complicated. Wait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial. But the problem didn't specify any particular term in \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient as a numerical factor, regardless of \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make more sense because then the coefficient would be a single number. So, let me try that approach. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That would mean I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, and then multiply them together. So, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that using the binomial theorem. \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so 6 - 2k = 0. Solving for k: 6 - 2k = 0 => 2k = 6 => k = 3. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6*6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), it just said the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I need to consider all possible exponents of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a single coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients of terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I calculated earlier, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But earlier, I thought that might be the case. However, I'm a bit confused because the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me see if I can find a better way to approach this.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is a single term, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because when you multiply by each term in the second polynomial, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second polynomial. The sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64, as I calculated before. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought about finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which was 120. So, which one is correct? I think it depends on what the problem is asking. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 384. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. Since the problem didn't specify any power of \\(c\\), I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check.\n\nWait, in the problem statement, it's written as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, in the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any integer \\(k\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nBut to make sure, let me think differently. Suppose I expand both polynomials separately and then multiply them. The first polynomial, \\((a + b)^4\\), has terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), etc. The second polynomial, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^5 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c} = 6c^4\\), \\(15c^3 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^2} = 15c\\), \\(20c^2 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^3} = 20 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c}\\), etc. So, when I multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2 \\cdot 6c^4 = 36a^2b^2c^4\\), and so on. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by 6. Since the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in the second part.\n\n1. **Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   This is calculated by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the two results:**\n   \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{384}\\)"

    "text": " Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to figure out if this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables from \\(c\\), so when I multiply the two expressions together, the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is in the second part? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second part is multiplied by the first part, but since the variables are different, maybe they are independent? Hmm, actually, no, the variables are different, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, because the second part's expansion involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't interact with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, does that mean the coefficient is just 6? Wait, but let me think again. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then the product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by terms from the second expression. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first expression, and the second expression's terms are in terms of \\(c\\), when you multiply them, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is the exponent from the second part. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, does that mean that the coefficient is just the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire second expression? Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expression, you get terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each possible power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expression. Wait, but that can't be right because the second expression is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\). But when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, you get different terms in the product. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expression. Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in the second expression is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384? Hmm, that seems high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Since the two parts are multiplied together, and the variables are different, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire second expression evaluated at the terms that don't involve \\(c\\), but actually, there is no term in the second expression that is a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), except when the exponents cancel out. Wait, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the term where \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) is when \\(k = 3\\), which gives the constant term \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term in the second expression is 20. Therefore, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the second expression, the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is when you multiply by the constant term 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, that makes more sense because only the constant term would leave \\(a^2b^2\\) as is; otherwise, you'd have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), which are different terms. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Let me verify this again. The first part: \\((a + b)^4\\) has \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second part: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a constant term when the exponents cancel, which is when \\(c^3\\) and \\(1/c^3\\) multiply, so the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^3 \\cdot (1/c)^3 = 20\\). Therefore, when multiplying the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by 20 from the second part, resulting in a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems correct. I think I was confused earlier about whether all the terms in the second expression contribute, but actually, only the constant term affects the \\(a^2b^2\\) term directly. The other terms would create additional variables, so they don't contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\).

    "text": " Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6 for that part. \n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient I found, 6, is multiplied by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not involving \\(c\\). That seems a bit confusing. Let me think again. Oh, wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check: it says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, actually, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), that means we need the part of the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because \\(c^0 = 1\\), so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply the two expressions together, \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the term with \\(c^0\\) from the second part, resulting in \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nLet me figure that out. The expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can also be expanded using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because that's the constant term. So, we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). \n\nSo, now, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the coefficient from the second part, which is 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with a coefficient of 6, and the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives a constant term with a coefficient of 20.

    "text": " Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder if this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), I think the coefficients in the second part won't directly affect the exponent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). That is, when I multiply the two expanded expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the other terms involving \\(c\\) won't impact this coefficient. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the same as the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), perhaps it's just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again.\n\nActually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term in the first expression, we can consider that term as a constant when multiplying by the second expression. That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you're effectively scaling \\(a^2b^2\\) by each coefficient, and then summing them all up. But wait, no, actually, the terms in the second expansion don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by, say, \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), you just get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would require the terms where the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out, but I don't think that's the case here. Wait, no, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so effectively, you're just scaling \\(a^2b^2\\) by the sum of the coefficients of the second part.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those terms will have their own coefficients, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), those terms would just contribute to the coefficient by their own coefficients. So, effectively, the total coefficient is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second part.\n\nBut wait, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\). Because when \\(c = 1\\), each term becomes just its coefficient. So, \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Is the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) really 64? Let me check. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\), yes. So, the sum of the coefficients is indeed 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm wrong because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you're not just scaling the term \\(a^2b^2\\) by 64, but each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But since the second expansion includes terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think differently. Suppose I don't consider the second part as a separate entity. Let me consider that \\((a + b)^4\\) gives me a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is another polynomial. When I multiply these two, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, each of which has coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm confusing the sum of coefficients with something else. Let me check. The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is indeed found by setting all variables to 1. So, for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), setting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), which is correct. Therefore, the sum of the coefficients is 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure there isn't another way this could be approached. Alternatively, maybe I can consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficients involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of those involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is simply the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the part with \\(c\\) just contributes a factor of 64, as calculated before. So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me try another approach to confirm. Let me consider that the entire expression is the product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since the sum of coefficients is 64, as before, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the coefficient being 6 multiplied by 64, which is 384. That seems consistent.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's a different interpretation. Suppose I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is being expanded, and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but maybe I should expand both parts and see. Let me try that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) expanded is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as before.\n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. Each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply the two expansions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because each term in the second part has a coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it just scales that term by that coefficient. So, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\).\n\nBut the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\), as we saw before. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure that this is correct. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and when multiplied by each term in the second part, which has coefficients summing to 64, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of two polynomials. The first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the coefficients in one part don't affect the coefficients in the other. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is simply the product of the coefficients from each part. But in this case, the coefficient from the first part is 6, and the sum of coefficients from the second part is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have multiple variables, you have to consider cross terms, but in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), their coefficients are independent. So, I think my reasoning is correct.\n\nLet me try a different approach to confirm. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I set \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), and \\(c = 1\\), then the expression becomes \\((1 + 1)^4 \\times (1 + 1)^6 = 16 \\times 64 = 1024\\). But that's the sum of all coefficients in the entire expansion. But I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term. So, how can I find that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the multinomial theorem or consider generating functions. But perhaps it's easier to think of the expression as the product of two independent binomial expansions.\n\nWait, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we saw. Now, when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is another binomial expansion, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me consider a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{2}{2} = 1\\), and the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\) is \\((1 + 1) = 2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Let's check by expanding: \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\). Multiplying these gives \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in this product would be \\(c + 1/c\\), which when considering only the coefficients (by setting \\(c = 1\\)) is 2, which matches our earlier calculation. So, that seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem and properties of polynomial multiplication.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, I'm not sure how this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and this second part is in terms of \\(c\\). So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is from the second part when it's multiplied? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second part is multiplied by the first part, but the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, actually, when you multiply the two expressions together, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that means we only need the constant term from the second part, right? Because if we take the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by the constant term from the second part, that's the only term that will contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nLet me think about that. The expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can also be expanded using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part has a coefficient of 6, and the constant term from the second part is 20. When you multiply these two, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. So, the first part gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part contributes 20 when it's a constant, so yes, multiplying them gives 120. So, the coefficient should be 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanding, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in terms where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms don't affect that. So, the only contribution comes from the constant term in the second part, which is 20, multiplied by the coefficient from the first part, which is 6. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. So, I think that's correct.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. Let me just recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) to find the constant term. Using the binomial theorem, the constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which happens at \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. Multiply the two coefficients together: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The constant term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both parts:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient I just found. Let me think. Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is part of the first factor, and the second factor is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), maybe the coefficients from the second part don't directly affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.

However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the first factor and the second factor doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that doesn't seem right because the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, this product is a polynomial in variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by the entire second part, it would result in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot c^{-k}\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Wait, that can't be right because in the product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first factor would be multiplied by all the terms from the second factor, which would give terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., up to \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, we need to consider all the terms that result in \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which is a sum of terms. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a sum of coefficients from the second part. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would only come from the product of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term (if any) in the second part. But the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms with different powers of \\(c\\). There isn't a constant term unless the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, the term where \\(c^0\\) is the only term that would contribute to a constant term when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense.\n\nSo, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already did: it's 6. Now, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nNow, since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\) in the second part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 and 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   Setting the exponent of \\(c\\) to 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both parts:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part.\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider both parts together. But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part of the expression involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(c\\) won't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That is, when I multiply the two expansions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the same as the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But actually, no, wait. Because the second part is also a binomial expression, and when you multiply the two expressions together, each term in the first expansion will multiply each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that can't be right because the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), but since we're looking for a term that only has \\(a^2b^2\\), the part involving \\(c\\) can be any term, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part? Wait, that doesn't make sense because the second part is a separate binomial expansion. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression is the product of two separate binomial expansions. So, when we expand both, we get terms of the form \\((a + b)^4\\) times terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, we're looking for all terms where the exponent of \\(a\\) is 2 and the exponent of \\(b\\) is 2, and then the exponents of \\(c\\) can be anything. But since the coefficient is just a numerical factor, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is simply the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't sound right because when you multiply, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But that can't be correct because the second expansion isn't just a constant; it's a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\). Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in that expansion, the resulting terms would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that we're only considering the term where the exponent of \\(a\\) is 2 and \\(b\\) is 2, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\). So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from the first part) times 64 (the sum of coefficients from the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm misapplying the concept. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). But in the product, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term from the second part, which are terms like \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\). So, the resulting terms would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is only considering the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes to a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible powers of \\(c\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product being equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives 64, as I did before. Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first polynomial, and \\(c\\) is only in the second, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. So, the coefficient would be 6 * \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try another approach. Let's expand both parts separately and then see how they multiply.\n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\):\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\n\\]\nWhich simplifies to:\n\\[\n1a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier.\n\nNow, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The exponents of \\(c\\) will be 6, 4, 2, 0, -2, -4, -6 as \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 6.\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) (which has a coefficient of 6) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.\n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), as I thought earlier. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me double-check this logic. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). The product P(a, b) * Q(c) will have terms where each term of P is multiplied by each term of Q. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P times the sum of all coefficients in Q, because each term in Q contributes to a term in the product where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some power of c. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to write out the product, it would be:\n\n\\[\n(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4) \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\right)\n\\]\n\nSo, when I multiply each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 (from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term) multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient would be 6 times each coefficient in the second polynomial, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second polynomial. But if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then perhaps it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had specified a particular power of \\(c\\), like \\(c^0\\), then we would have to multiply 6 by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on \\(c\\), I think the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because in the product, each term is a combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every possible power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible \\(c\\) terms would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, this is where I'm getting confused. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", but in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So, does the problem want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, or does it want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 times the constant term in the second polynomial?\n\nI think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the answer would be 384.\n\nWait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think of it another way. If I were to collect all terms in the product that have \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then each such term would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 * 20 = 120. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all terms in the other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. So, the coefficient would be 6 * \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps it's expecting a number, not a polynomial. Therefore, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem, and it's actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I'm not sure. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\"\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the monomial \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply that \\(c\\) can be any power, but the coefficient is just the numerical factor in front of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. But I'm not sure which interpretation is correct.\n\nWait, maybe I can look for similar problems or think about how coefficients are treated in products of polynomials. When you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all terms in the other polynomial. So, for example, if I have \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\), because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) contributes to a term in the product where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by that term.\n\nTherefore, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me confirm this with an example. Suppose I have \\( (a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1 \\). Then, expanding, we get \\( (a + b)(c + 1/c) = ac + a/c + bc + b/c \\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first part times the entire second part, which would be 1 * (c + 1/c) = c + 1/c. But if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's the entire expression \\(c + 1/c\\). But if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a c^0\\), then it's 1 * 1 = 1. So, in that case, the problem would depend on whether we're considering the coefficient across all powers of \\(c\\) or just the constant term.\n\nGiven that the problem didn't specify any power of \\(c\\), I think it's expecting the coefficient across all powers, which would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in the example I just did, if I were to ask for the coefficient of \\(a\\), it would be \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, which would mean that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but in the example, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial, but perhaps in the problem, since it's asking for a coefficient, it's expecting a numerical value, implying that it's considering \\(c^0\\). Therefore, maybe the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to clarify. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". In the context of polynomials, the coefficient of a specific monomial, like \\(a^2b^2\\), would typically refer to the coefficient when that monomial is multiplied by any power of other variables. So, in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). But that's a bit ambiguous because it's a polynomial in three variables. So, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient when \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the intended interpretation is that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have two variables, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another variable \\(c\\), and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would mean I'm considering all terms where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, each such term would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), and the coefficient for each of those terms would be 6 times the coefficient of that power of \\(c\\) in the second expansion. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any restriction on \\(c\\), then perhaps it's the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for all \\(k\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut I'm still a bit unsure. Let me try to look for similar problems or think about how coefficients are treated. For example, if you have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + d)^1\\), and you're asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\), that would be 1 times (c + d), which is c + d. But if you're asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0c^1d^0\\), that would be 1 * 1 = 1. So, in the given problem, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's similar to asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, i.e., 384.\n\nAlternatively, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120.\n\nGiven that the problem didn't specify any power of \\(c\\), I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nWait, but let me check the second expansion again. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64, as I calculated earlier by substituting \\(c = 1\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nSo, after all this thinking, I believe the coefficient is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think I can just consider the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient in the product, but only considering \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be a term in the product. So, perhaps I need to consider that when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes only from the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), the multiplication would give \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient is a number, not a polynomial. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". Oh, wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a number. Hmm, that doesn't make sense because coefficients are usually constants. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expansion, which would include all the \\(c\\) terms. But the way the problem is phrased, it's a bit ambiguous. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible terms, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that's multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not correct either. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but without considering the \\(c\\) terms. That is, maybe the problem is treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable and is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's still a polynomial. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when the entire expression is expanded, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too large. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because \\(c\\) is a different variable. But that doesn't seem right because the problem includes both parts. Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second part. So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But again, that's a polynomial, not a number. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expansion, but only the coefficient, not the variables. That is, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of coefficients would be \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that doesn't seem right because the sum of coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\), so maybe that's the approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, but perhaps the problem is only interested in the constant term, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, maybe I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6. Let me try that approach. So, first, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 20, which is 120. That seems more reasonable. So, putting it all together, the coefficient is 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term in the second part), giving 120. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient from the \\((a + b)^4\\) term, which is 6. Then, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think we don't need to consider the terms involving \\(c\\) because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion. However, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first polynomial, and the second polynomial only involves \\(c\\), when you multiply them, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will just be multiplied by the entire second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the sum of all terms in the other polynomial. But in this case, since the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a separate part. Wait, that can't be right because the variables are different. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), because when you multiply by the second part, which only has \\(c\\) terms, it doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would remain 6, and then multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient, not the entire term, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) or something, but the problem just says \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because each term in the product would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But since the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all terms, but that doesn't make sense because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^4\\) or something else. Wait, no, the problem is as given: \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is simply 6, and the rest of the terms involve \\(c\\), so the coefficient remains 6. But that seems too simple, and the presence of the second part makes me think that maybe I'm supposed to consider something else. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. That would make more sense, but the problem didn't specify that. Hmm. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. So, that can't be right. Therefore, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, meaning considering all possible terms, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting all variables with 1. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is... Wait, but \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a separate expansion, and when you multiply the two polynomials, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second polynomial. As I calculated before, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384. \n\nWait, but let me verify that. Let's consider a simpler case. Suppose we have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 times (c + 1/c), so the coefficient would be 1 * (1 + 1) = 2, since the sum of coefficients in (c + 1/c) is 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) would also be 1 * 2 = 2. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 2, which is indeed 1 * 2. Similarly, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems to make sense. Therefore, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and treating the \\(c\\) part as a constant coefficient. Wait, that might make more sense. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't seem right because then it would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for a coefficient, so maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts, and the rest is just a coefficient.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, so the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That would mean that in the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because \\(c^0 = 1\\), so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it just gives \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe that's what the problem is asking for.\n\nIf that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by 6, the coefficient from the first part. So, let's work on that.\n\nFirst, let me find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\).

So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20. So, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, let me just double-check my steps. First, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(c\\) cancels out (i.e., exponent zero) occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), that would be different, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think the intended interpretation is that \\(c\\) terms are to be considered such that they don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, meaning we're looking for the constant term in the \\(c\\) part. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nSo, I think I've got it. The coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   Setting the exponent of \\(c\\) to zero, we solve \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) to get \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from the two parts:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."
