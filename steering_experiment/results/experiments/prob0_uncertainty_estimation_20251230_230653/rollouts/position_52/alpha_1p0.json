But wait, no, that's not quite right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. But since the second polynomial includes terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), unless we're specifically looking for a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), those would contribute to other terms in the product. However, since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way that can happen is if we multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial by the constant term from the second polynomial. So, that reinforces my earlier conclusion that the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's correct. Maybe I can also consider a small example to test this approach. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Let's compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, in \\((a + b)^2\\), the highest exponent is \\(a^2b^0\\) and \\(a^0b^2\\), so \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't even present. So, maybe that's not a good test. Let me try \\((a + b)^3 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b\\) in \\((a + b)^3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{3}{1} = 3\\). The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\((c + 1/c)^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{2}{1} = 2\\), because the expansion is \\(c^2 + 2c*(1/c) + (1/c)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b\\) in the entire expression would be 3 * 2 = 6. Let me check by expanding the entire expression: \\((a + b)^3 = a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3\\). \\((c + 1/c)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). Multiplying these together, the term \\(a^2b\\) from the first expansion would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, \\(3a^2b * c^2 = 3a^2b c^2\\), \\(3a^2b * 2 = 6a^2b\\), and \\(3a^2b * 1/c^2 = 3a^2b / c^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b\\) (without any \\(c\\) terms) is indeed 6, which is 3 * 2. So, that seems to confirm that my approach is correct. Therefore, applying the same logic to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) should be 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's solid. So, yeah, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0.
