Let me write out the product:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\left(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\right) \\times \\left(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\right)\n\\]\n\nWhen we multiply these two sums together, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would require that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as before. So, that gives \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2\\). Then, to get the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, we need to multiply this by all terms from the second sum where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\).

    "text": " Wait, but let me double-check that reasoning. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, in this case, since we're taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and \\(c^0\\) from the second, their product will indeed contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the overall product, and since there are no other terms in the first polynomial that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without involving \\(c\\), this should be the only contribution. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two expansions, so the coefficient is the product of the individual coefficients. So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the answer. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Another way to approach this is to consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), and the second polynomial is in \\(c\\), the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) is to multiply by the constant term in the second polynomial. So, that's why we only need to consider the product of the coefficients from each part. So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me try another approach to confirm. Let's consider the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we want the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for the second part, we want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\), as before. The coefficient from the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the term is \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2 c^0\\), which is \\(120 a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nWait, but is there any other term that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\)? For example, could there be a term where \\(c\\) is raised to some power, but when multiplied by another term, it cancels out? Hmm, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so any term in the product that includes \\(c\\) would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, which wouldn't be part of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the term where \\(c^0\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) contributes. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the entire expansion without splitting it up. Let me think. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that don't involve \\(c\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's only the product of the two coefficients I found earlier. So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but maybe I should think about whether the two parts are independent. Since \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term in the second part, because any term from the second part with a non-zero power of \\(c\\) would make the product term have a \\(c\\) component, which we don't want. Therefore, only the constant term in the second part contributes, so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think about the general term in the product. Each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\) and each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when you multiply these, you get terms like \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, to get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\), you need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\), and from the second part, you need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 * 20 = 120\\). So, that's consistent with what I found earlier.\n\nI think I've considered it from multiple angles, and each time I arrive at the same answer: 120. So, I feel confident that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\).

So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that we're interested in is 20, so when you multiply them, it's 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I should think of the entire expression as a product of two expansions and consider how the terms combine. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only need the term where the \\(c\\) parts cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, the coefficient would indeed be 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the answer. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nWait, perhaps I should write out the expansions more explicitly to see if I made a mistake. Let's see: \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6.

So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. However, only the constant term (20) in the second polynomial will contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product, because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, which would make the term not just \\(a^2b^2\\).

    "text": " Wait, so the coefficient is 20 times 6, which is 120? Hmm, let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and then it's multiplied by the constant term from the other polynomial, which is 20. So, when you multiply these two, you get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. But wait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there a possibility that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) could come from other combinations in the product? For example, if I multiply a term with \\(a^3b\\) from the first polynomial by a term with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), could that somehow result in \\(a^2b^2\\)? Wait, no, because when you multiply by a term that has \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), you can't get rid of the \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. Each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term can only come from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial multiplied by the constant term in the second polynomial. So, that should be the only contribution. Therefore, the coefficient should indeed be 6 times 20, which is 120. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is a monomial in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a monomial in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them together, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the only way to get a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\) (without any \\(c\\) terms) is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion by the \\(c^0\\) term from the second expansion. So, that's exactly what I did before. So, I think my reasoning is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being a product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, that's 6 times 20, which is 120. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nWait, but let me check if the second expansion's constant term is indeed 20. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expansion: the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, to get the exponent 0, 6 - 2m = 0, so m = 3. Then, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Yep, that's correct. So, the constant term is 20. So, that part is right.\n\nAnd the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. So, I think that's the answer.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can write out the expansions a bit more explicitly. Let's see, \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found before.\n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). So, the constant term is 20. So, when I multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first will multiply 20 from the second, giving 20a^2b^2. Wait, no, it's 6 times 20, which is 120, so the term is 120a^2b^2. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the product, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first is 6a^2b^2, and the constant term from the second is 20. So, when you multiply them, you get 6 * 20 * a^2b^2, which is 120a^2b^2. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but I'm wondering if I'm supposed to consider cross terms or something else. For example, if I take a term like \\(a^3b\\) from the first expansion and multiply it by a term that has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) in such a way that the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, but that would still result in a term that has \\(a^3b\\) times some \\(c\\) term, which would not be \\(a^2b^2\\). So, no, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion by the constant term from the second expansion.\n\nTherefore, I think my answer is correct. The coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, maybe I can think of it another way. Let me consider the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, to get a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\), we need the exponent of \\(a\\) to be 2 and the exponent of \\(b\\) to be 2, which happens when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as I found before. So, that gives us the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, the exponent of \\(c\\) in that term is \\(6 - 2m\\), and for the term to not have any \\(c\\), we need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, I think I can confidently say that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(c^0\\) corresponds to \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\).
