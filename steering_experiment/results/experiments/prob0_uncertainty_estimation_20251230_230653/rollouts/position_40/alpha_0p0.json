    "text": " Wait, does that make sense? Let me double-check. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial and the constant term in the second polynomial. Since those are independent, their coefficients multiply. So, yes, 6 times 20 is 120. So, the coefficient should be 120. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Is there any other term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by terms from \\((a + b)^4\\)? Well, no, because any term with a positive or negative exponent of \\(c\\) would result in a term that has \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would make the entire term have a \\(c\\) component, which we don't want since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the constant term in the second polynomial contributes, and that's when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which we found to be 20. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, just to be thorough, let me think about the entire expansion. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But only the term in the second part that has \\(c^0\\) will result in a term that is \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. All other terms will have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) multiplied, so they won't be pure \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the only contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by the constant term in the second polynomial. So, 6 * 20 is correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me write out the expansions more explicitly. So, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is indeed 6a^2b^2. Now, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15(1/c^2) + 6(1/c^4) + 1/c^6\\). So, the constant term is 20, as we found. So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But only when it's multiplied by the constant term (20) will it result in a term that is \\(a^2b^2\\) times 20. All other multiplications would introduce \\(c\\) terms, which we don't want. So, yes, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.

I think I might have missed something because the problem involves multiplying two expansions together, and I considered only the constant term from the second expansion. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the first polynomial, I need to multiply it by every term in the second polynomial. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a scalar (6), when multiplied by the entire second polynomial, each term in the second polynomial will get multiplied by 6. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Wait, but in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which includes terms with \\(c^k\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but it's written as \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, that might be the case. So, perhaps I need to consider the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. Alternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second polynomial, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which implies a constant. So, perhaps the problem is intended to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to treat \\(c\\) as another variable and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but that would require considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), which would result in the coefficient being 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which isn't a single number. So, that can't be the case. Therefore, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, my final answer is 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) in the first part, and \\(m\\) such that the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which we found to be \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. Since we're only interested in the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), we take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) from the second polynomial and multiply them together. So, that's 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.
