Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. I think I might have made a mistake here. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial multiplies each term in the second polynomial. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) which has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) which has a term \\(20c^0\\), then when I multiply these two terms together, I get \\(6 * 20 * a^2b^2c^0\\), which is \\(120a^2b^2\\). So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, if I consider the entire expansion, any other term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would have a power of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would result in a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), where \\(k\\) is non-zero.

So, yes, 6 * 20 is indeed 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. I think that's correct. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of two expressions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can treat the two parts separately.
