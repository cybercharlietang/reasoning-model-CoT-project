Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiplying them gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as the product of two separate expansions, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part with \\(c^0\\) from the second part. So, yeah, 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's the correct answer.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that when you have two separate expressions multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first expression, and \\(c^0\\) is only in the second, their product gives the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is exactly what we're looking for. So, yes, 120 is the coefficient.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. The binomial coefficients are calculated correctly, and the reasoning about how the terms multiply seems solid. So, I feel confident that the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\nWait a second, let me just double-check my reasoning to make sure I didn't miss anything.

Since the second part doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), it's just a scalar multiple. So, yes, the coefficient is the product of the two coefficients.
