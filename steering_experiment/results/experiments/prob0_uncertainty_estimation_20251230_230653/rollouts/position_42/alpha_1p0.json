So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two expansions, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6, and the coefficient for \\(c^0\\) is 20, so their product is 120. So, I think that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something else. Is there a possibility that other terms from the second expansion could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by terms from the first expansion? For example, could a term with \\(c\\) from the second expansion somehow combine with a term from the first expansion to give \\(a^2b^2\\)? But no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms. So, any term in the product that includes a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) would not be part of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, only the constant term (with \\(c^0\\)) from the second expansion would contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term when multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion. So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120 is the correct coefficient.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem by considering the entire expansion and looking for all possible ways to get \\(a^2b^2\\). But since the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), which is separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and the \\(c^0\\) term from the second part. So, that reinforces my earlier conclusion.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the product as a product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. Since the two parts are multiplied together, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient for the term \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0\\) would indeed be the product of the individual coefficients.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is at \\(k = 2\\), so \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). That's correct. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is at \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). That's correct too. So, 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the right answer.\n\nWait, just to be thorough, let me think about expanding both parts and multiplying. Let's write out \\((a + b)^4\\) as \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). And \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). Now, if I multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would multiply each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can ignore all the terms in the second expansion except the constant term, which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120, as I found earlier. So, that confirms it.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to consider the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in the second expansion, because any other term would involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would make the term not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, 120 is the correct coefficient.\n\nI think I've thought this through thoroughly.
