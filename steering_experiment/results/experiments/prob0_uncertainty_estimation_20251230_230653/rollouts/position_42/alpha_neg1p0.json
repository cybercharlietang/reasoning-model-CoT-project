So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. I don't think I missed anything here. The key was recognizing that when you multiply the two polynomials, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) only comes from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial and the constant term in the second polynomial, since any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) component, which we don't want. So, yeah, 120 should be the correct coefficient.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part. \n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**  \n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**  \n   The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Combining the coefficients:**  \n   Multiply the two coefficients: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. I think that makes sense. Let me just visualize the expansion a bit more to make sure I didn't miss anything. So, when you expand \\((a + b)^4\\), you get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). Similarly, when you expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you get terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\) with coefficients based on the binomial coefficients. When you multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only term in the second expansion that will contribute is the one with \\(c^0\\), which is 20. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion (which is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2) multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion (which is 20) gives 6*20 a\u00b2b\u00b2, which is 120a\u00b2b\u00b2. So, yes, that seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes here.
