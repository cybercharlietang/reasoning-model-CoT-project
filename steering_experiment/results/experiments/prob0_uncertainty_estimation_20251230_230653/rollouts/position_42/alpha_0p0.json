So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. I think that makes sense. Let me see if there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

    "text": " In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when you multiply these together, you get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. I think that makes sense. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, just to verify. Alternatively, I could consider the entire expansion, but that might be more complicated. Alternatively, since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the rest of the terms involve \\(c\\), which we don't care about, we can treat \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) as a constant when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But actually, that's not accurate because \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is not a constant; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, when we multiply it by \\((a + b)^4\\), the only term that will contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because any other term would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, making the entire product have a \\(c\\) term, which we don't want. So, that confirms that we only need the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, and multiply it by 6 from the other part, giving 120. I think that's correct. Let me check with another example. Suppose instead of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), it was something else, say \\(\\left(d + e\\right)^n\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the coefficient of \\(d^0e^0\\) or something, but in this case, since the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), we have to ensure that the \\(c\\) terms cancel out.
