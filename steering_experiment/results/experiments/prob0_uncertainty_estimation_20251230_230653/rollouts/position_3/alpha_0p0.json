That means I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) would be when \\(k = 2\\), right? Because if \\(k = 2\\), then the exponent of \\(b\\) is 2, and the exponent of \\(a\\) would be \\(4 - 2 = 2\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider both parts together. But wait, I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so maybe the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), will just contribute a constant factor when multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part. Let me check that.\n\nThe second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem to expand this. The expansion would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWait, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think that when I multiply the two expansions together, only the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) from the second part will affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Because if I take any other term from the second part, it would have a \\(c\\) raised to some power, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would result in a term that includes \\(c\\), which isn't what we're looking for. So, I only need to consider the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero in the second expansion.\n\nSo, I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me set up the equation: \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), I get \\(6 = 2m\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(m = 3\\) will have \\(c^0 = 1\\). The coefficient for this term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient from the second part is 20.\n\nNow, since the two parts are multiplied together, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through each step again.\n\nFirst, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, expanding \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero occurs when \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together, 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nWait, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each factor. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), only the constant term from the second factor will affect its coefficient. So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120 is correct.\n\nI think that's the answer. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for each part.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient from this part is 6.\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\).

    "text": " So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nAlright, let's start with the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this should expand to the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I'm looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), which means I need \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\). So, in this case, \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a^{4 - k}\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) should be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I also need to expand this using the binomial theorem. The expansion would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWait, but in the original problem, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so maybe I don't need to worry about the second part affecting the coefficient? Hmm, no, that doesn't seem right. Wait, actually, the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply these two expansions together, I get a product of terms from each expansion.\n\nBut wait, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and since the second part doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, it will just be \\(a^2b^2\\) times something involving \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply that we're looking for the term where the power of \\(a\\) is 2, \\(b\\) is 2, and the power of \\(c\\) is zero, because otherwise, it's multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, we need to find the term in the expansion where \\(c^0\\), so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nTherefore, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already found to be 6.\n\nSo, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). From the expansion earlier, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from the second part with coefficient 20, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of these two coefficients. So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the first part gives me 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives me 20 for \\(c^0\\), so when I multiply these together, it's 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right.\n\nBut let me double-check my steps. First, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed at \\(k=2\\), which gives 6. Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which happens when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about the entire expansion as a product of two polynomials. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) is a polynomial in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\). When I multiply them together, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial will be multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider only those terms in the second polynomial that don't involve \\(c\\), because otherwise, the term would become \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something, which isn't what we're looking for. Therefore, we need the term in the second polynomial where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which we found to be 20. So, multiplying 6 * 20 gives 120.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that since the two polynomials are independent, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, which is exactly what I did.\n\nSo, I think my reasoning is correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this expands to:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe are interested in the term where \\(a^2b^2\\). This occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient for this term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, this expands to:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient for this term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), I can write it as the sum from k=0 to 4 of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\).\n\nNow, since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find the term where the exponents of a and b are both 2. That would happen when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for a, which means \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6.\n\nBut wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to make sure that when I multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't affected by the other part. Let me think about that. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, right? Because the other part involves c and 1/c, which are different variables. So when I multiply, the exponents of a and b won't be affected by c terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression should just be the same as the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe I'm missing something. The entire expression is the product of two binomials: one in a and b, and the other in c and 1/c. Since a, b, and c are different variables, their exponents don't interfere with each other. So, when I expand the entire expression, the terms involving a and b will be multiplied by terms involving c and 1/c, but since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can treat the two parts separately. That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms, I can consider the coefficient as 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the c part. Wait, no, that's not right. Because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because that would make the coefficient depend on c terms, which it shouldn't. Wait, no, actually, I think I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nLet me clarify: When you have two separate expressions multiplied together, the coefficients of terms in one don't affect the coefficients in the other, as long as the variables are different. So, since the first part is in a and b, and the second part is in c, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms, the coefficient will be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would actually include all the c terms as coefficients. Wait, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering all possible c terms, but that seems odd because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve c. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, no, actually, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so it's just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the a and b terms. So, the coefficient remains 6, regardless of the c terms. Let me think again: when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which are terms involving c and 1/c. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms, I think that the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, but that would mean 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) evaluated at c=1, which is 6 times 2^6, which is 6*64=384. But that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's correct.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me approach it differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so that term doesn't involve c. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve c, it's actually just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the a and b exponents. Therefore, the coefficient is 6, and the c terms don't matter because we're only looking at the a and b part.\n\nWait, but that seems contradictory because when you multiply, you're distributing, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all terms in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, meaning that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by each term in the second part. But that can't be right because the coefficient is a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where c is raised to the zero power. That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would involve c terms, which isn't possible. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression. That would make more sense. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply those two coefficients together.\n\nOkay, that makes more sense. So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's use the binomial theorem again for this part. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe want the term where the exponent of c is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6*6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression, which is the product of the two parts, we multiply the coefficients from each part: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when we multiply these two parts, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\) from the second part, which gives \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), and the coefficient is 6*20=120.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about c. So, does that mean we're considering all possible c terms, or only the c^0 term? Because if we consider all possible c terms, then the coefficient would actually be a polynomial in c, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, it must be that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of a, b, and c are 2, 2, and 0 respectively.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So maybe I can just focus on the \\((a + b)^4\\) part and find the coefficient there, and then the other part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) might not affect it?

Solving for \\(m\\):\n\n\\(6 - 2m = 0\\)\n\n\\(2m = 6\\)\n\n\\(m = 3\\)\n\nSo, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the constant term. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, when we multiply the two expressions \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression will be multiplied by the constant term 20 in the second expression. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes here. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term from the other expansion is 20. Multiplying them together gives 120. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the entire expansion as the product of two separate binomial expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, so when multiplied, they contribute 6*20 = 120 to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, I don't think I made any mistakes here. The key was recognizing that to get a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), I needed the constant term from the second expansion, and then just multiply that by the coefficient from the first expansion.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we focus on the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each. This occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. This happens when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), solving for \\(m\\) gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each expansion:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLet me start by looking at the first part of the expression: \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, I can expand this. The general term in the expansion would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I need to find the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in this case, \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). Let me calculate \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). That's 4! / (2! * (4 - 2)!) = (24)/(2 * 2) = 24/4 = 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but the second part of the expression involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Wait, so does that mean that \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\)? So, when I multiply the two expressions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of the second part. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms? Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), right?\n\nWait, let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the entire expression, each term will be of the form \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^m \\times (1/c)^n\\) or something like that. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part? That doesn't seem right because the second part has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by every term from the second part. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), its coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from the second part. But that can't be right because the second part is a separate expression. Wait, no, that's not correct. When you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expression. But wait, no, that's not correct either because the second expression is in terms of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by terms involving \\(c\\), those would be separate terms in the product. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expression, but that's not correct because the second expression isn't being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) as a variable, but rather as a term. Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me clarify: The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\). So, the term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, which means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, from the first part, we have \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), as I found earlier.\n\nNow, the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), does that mean that the exponent of \\(c\\) must be zero? Because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, and we're only interested in terms where the \\(c\\) part is \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, in other words, we need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which means \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient from the second part when \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from both parts, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Then, in the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we need the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., \\(c^0\\), which happens when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient there is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the entire expression is a product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Since these are independent, their product gives the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the overall product, which is 120.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. Let me just recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using binomial theorem: coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using binomial theorem: coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (i.e., the constant term) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiply these coefficients together: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be found by considering each part separately.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**  \n   Using the binomial theorem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\) in the expansion.  \n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**  \n   We need the constant term (\\(c^0\\)), which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), giving \\(m = 3\\).  \n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the coefficients:**  \n   Multiply the coefficients from both expansions:  \n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

Since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I might not need to consider the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with \\(c\\) in the multiplication. Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. So if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider how this term interacts with the other expression.\n\nWait, actually, no. Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't combine with \\(c\\) in any way.

The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So maybe I can compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems too broad. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), so maybe the answer is 6. But that seems too simple, so perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, I think it's considering the entire expression, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are multiplied by all the terms involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a single coefficient. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all possible terms, so maybe I'm supposed to find the coefficient in the entire expansion, but that seems complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me consider the entire expression as a product of two separate binomial expansions. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) expands to terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expands to terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate variables, when I multiply these two expansions, each term from the first will multiply each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Let me check that.\n\nWait, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems high. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, another way: Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient is a number, not a polynomial. Wait, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but that's not standard. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the other part is just a constant multiplier. Wait, but \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) isn't a constant; it's a function of \\(c\\). So perhaps the coefficient is 6 multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again: It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, perhaps the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but then the coefficient would be a function of \\(c\\), which isn't a single number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, which is 6, and the rest is just along for the ride. But that seems unlikely because the entire expression includes \\(c\\) terms.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. If I consider the entire expression as a product, then each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or something like that. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first part, it will be multiplied by each term from the second part. So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. As I calculated before, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64 when \\(c = 1\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because I'm not sure if that's how coefficients work when multiplying polynomials.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me expand both parts separately and then see how they multiply. So, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier.\n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a single number. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but that would mean the coefficient is a function of \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would require more work.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression, but without any \\(c\\) terms. But that seems impossible because \\(c\\) is part of the expression. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the rest is irrelevant. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a constant. But that's not correct because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is not a constant; it's a function of \\(c\\).\n\nWait, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), so the answer is 6. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the entire expression is a product, and so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I calculated earlier, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64 when \\(c = 1\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's the correct approach because I'm not sure if that's how coefficients work in the product of two polynomials.\n\nWait, another way: When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since we're looking for a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and not \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is a function of \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a constant multiplier, but that's not correct because the second part is not a constant.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the entire expression is a product, and so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second expansion. As I calculated before, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. But I'm not entirely confident about this approach.\n\nWait, let me verify this with a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\). The product would be \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product would be 0 because there are no \\(a^2b^2\\) terms; the highest power in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is 2 each, but in the product, each term would have either \\(a^2\\) times \\(c\\) or \\(a^2\\) times \\(1/c\\), etc. Wait, actually, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because you can't get \\(a^2b^2\\) from the product of \\((a + b)^2\\) and \\((c + 1/c)\\). Therefore, my earlier approach must be wrong because in this case, the coefficient is zero, not 2 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, so maybe the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion only if the second expansion is a constant. But in reality, the second expansion isn't a constant; it's a function of \\(c\\). Therefore, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, as in the first part, and the second part doesn't affect it because \\(c\\) is a separate variable. Therefore, the coefficient remains 6.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier thought. Let me think again. If I have two separate variables, \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), then when I multiply their expansions, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times each term in the second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient in the first part, which is 6, and the rest is irrelevant. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that the entire expression is a product, and so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would make the coefficient a function of \\(c\\), which isn't a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the rest is just a constant. But that's not correct because the second part is not a constant.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to see if there's another way. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I can treat \\(c\\) as a separate variable and realize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest of the expression is just a multiplier, but that would make the coefficient a function of \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, so the answer is 6. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let me try to think differently. Let me consider that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials. So, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which are powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of the second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the rest is irrelevant. But that seems inconsistent.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the entire expression is a product, and so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. But in my earlier example, that approach didn't work because the coefficient was zero, not 2 times the sum. Therefore, perhaps that approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a constant. But that's not correct because the second part is not a constant. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the second part is a constant, but that's not the case.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is mistyped, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^4\\), but that's just a guess. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating, and the answer is simply 6. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to recognize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the rest is irrelevant because \\(c\\) is a separate variable. Therefore, the coefficient is 6.\n\nWait, but in that case, why include the second part? Maybe the problem is just testing the binomial coefficient part, so the answer is 6. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to recognize that the entire expression is a product, and so the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would make the coefficient a function of \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the rest is just part of the expression, so the answer is 6. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the answer is indeed 6.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because \\(c\\) is a separate variable. Therefore, the answer is 6.\n\nWait, but in that case, why include the second part? Maybe the problem is just testing the binomial coefficient part, so the answer is 6.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that maybe the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. But in the simpler example I tried, that approach didn't work. So perhaps the correct answer is 6.\n\nWait, let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which are powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times each term in the second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a function of \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the rest is irrelevant. Therefore, the answer is 6.\n\nBut I'm still confused because the problem includes both parts, so maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would make the coefficient a function of \\(c\\), which isn't a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the rest is just part of the expression.\n\nWait, perhaps I should conclude that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as in the first part, and the second part doesn't affect it because \\(c\\) is a separate variable. Therefore, the answer is 6.\n\nWait, but I'm still not sure. Maybe I should look for another approach. Let me consider that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But in my earlier example, this approach didn't work, so perhaps it's not correct.\n\nWait, let me think again. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = 64\\), so the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 * 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this case would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that's only when \\(c = 1\\). But the problem isn't setting \\(c = 1\\); it's asking for the coefficient in the general case. Therefore, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a function of \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so this approach must be wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the answer is 6. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to compute the coefficient in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but that would make the coefficient a function of \\(c\\), which isn't a single number.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), which would be 6. Therefore, I think the answer is 6.\n\nWait, but I'm still confused because the problem includes both parts. Maybe I should look for another way. Let me consider that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from the first part times the entire second part. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps the answer is 6.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient from the first part, so the answer is 6.\n\nWait, but I'm not confident. Let me try to think differently. If I have to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). But that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the rest is irrelevant. Therefore, the answer is 6.\n\nWait, but I'm still not sure. Maybe I should check online or with a textbook example. But since I can't do that, I'll have to make an educated guess. Given that \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that's a function of \\(c\\), not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient from the first part, which is 6.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to recognize that the coefficient is 6, and the rest is just part of the expression, so the answer is 6.\n\nWait, but I'm still confused because the problem includes both parts. Maybe the answer is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. But in my earlier example, that approach didn't work, so perhaps it's incorrect.\n\nWait, let me try to think of it differently. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in my earlier example, when I set \\(c = 1\\), the coefficient was zero, which contradicts this approach. Therefore, perhaps this approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me conclude that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as in the first part, and the rest is irrelevant. Therefore, the answer is 6.\n\nWait, but I'm still not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is 384. But I think I need to make a decision.\n\nI think the correct approach is to recognize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the rest of the expression is just a multiplier, so the coefficient remains 6. Therefore, the answer is 6.\n\nBut wait, in the problem, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part, which are functions of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a function of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps the answer is 6.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of the entire expression as a product, and when you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), you're effectively looking for the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term in the second part. But the second part doesn't have a constant term. Let me check: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The constant term occurs when the exponents cancel out, so when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which is when \\(m = 3\\). So the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that makes sense because the constant term is the only term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term, you get a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\) times a number, which would be the coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that seems plausible. Let me verify. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, when you multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, which has a coefficient of 6, by the constant term 20, you get 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120.\n\nWait, that makes sense because only the constant term in the second expansion would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without introducing any \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nBut earlier, I thought the answer was 384, but now I'm getting 120. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). Therefore, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by the constant term from the second part, which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the correct answer is 120.\n\nI think I was confused earlier because I considered all terms from the second expansion, but actually, only the constant term contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nAlright, so let's start with the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this would expand to \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I should find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That means I need to find \\(k\\) such that \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\) and \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). Solving for \\(k\\), I get \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. But wait, the problem isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how that multiplication affects the coefficient.\n\nHmm, okay, so the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, when I multiply the two expansions together, the coefficients for the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't be affected by the terms involving \\(c\\). That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that doesn't sound right either because the product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term because they are multiplied by different variables. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has multiple terms, each with their own coefficients. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not correct because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a separate term, so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, that's confusing. Let me think again.\n\nNo, actually, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, essentially, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nNow, how do I find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 64 (the sum of the coefficients in the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each factor. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), and the other expression involves \\(c\\), when you multiply, each term in the second expression will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\), effectively giving \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second expression. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. So, 6 times 64 is 384. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that when you expand the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present in each term of the second expansion, so each term in the second expansion contributes its own coefficient multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion multiplied by 6.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me consider an example with smaller exponents to see if this approach works. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in \\((a + b)^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{2}{0} = 1\\), and the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\) is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Let's expand it: \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The terms involving \\(a^2\\) are \\(a^2c\\) and \\(a^2(1/c)\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is indeed 2, which matches 1 * 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2 * 2 = 4, and so on. So, this approach seems valid.\n\nTherefore, applying it to the original problem, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), and \\(1/c^6\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, but the exponent of \\(c\\) can be anything. So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nBut wait, no, that's not correct because in the product, each term is a combination of the terms from both expansions. So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider all possible ways that \\(a^2b^2\\) can be formed in the product. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second part, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part by any term in the second part, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nSo, yes, 6 * 64 = 384 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that would be different. In that case, we would need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That would require a different approach, where we consider the product of the specific terms from each expansion that result in \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). But since the problem is just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the approach I took earlier is correct.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Recognize that this term is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n3. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n4. Multiply the two results: \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Multiplying these gives the final coefficient as 384.\n\n$\\boxed{384}$"

I'm specifically looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would happen when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\).

But since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part is in terms of \\(c\\), I think that the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the same as the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a single number, not involving \\(c\\). Maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and 1 from the second part, but that doesn't seem right either. Alternatively, perhaps the second part is multiplied as a whole, so when I take the product, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient, which should be a constant, not an expression involving \\(c\\).\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me clarify: the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe the coefficient is just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again: it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, in the entire product, each term would be of the form \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), etc., depending on the expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think refers to the coefficient without considering the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself isn't present unless multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). Hmm, that might make sense.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number, not involving \\(c\\). So, I think that's what the problem is asking for. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is the same as the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nOkay, so first, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the constant term, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6 and the constant term in the second part is 20, the overall coefficient when multiplying these two parts together is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, and the constant term comes from the second expansion. When you multiply these together, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nJust to double-check, maybe I can think of it another way. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanding, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but we only care about the terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which is just the constant term 20. So, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we first determine the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. This happens at \\(k = 3\\), giving the term \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

That part seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the next step is to consider this second part. I need to figure out how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, actually, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) because they don't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Hmm, is that right?\n\nLet me think. When I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't be affected by the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but wait, that doesn't make sense because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps I need to consider how the multiplication affects the coefficient.\n\nWait, no, actually, I think I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, when I multiply the two expressions, the variables don't interact. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the coefficient is a number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, actually, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables are independent, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term only in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part is in \\(c\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, so maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating all variables together. So, maybe I need to consider the entire expansion, including the \\(c\\) terms, but I'm only interested in the term where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't make sense because \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate variables, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems unusual. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression, but only the part that doesn't involve \\(c\\), but that doesn't make sense either.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating all variables together, so the term would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), which seems odd. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number.\n\nWait, the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two polynomials, the terms combine. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a single number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, but only considering the part where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). That would make the coefficient a number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^{10}\\) or something like that, but as it is, it's \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number, so maybe I need to consider that the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, but perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient when considering all possible terms, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, in the expansion, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m (1/c)^n\\), where \\(m + n = 6\\) because that's the exponent in the second binomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(k = 2\\) in the first part, which has a coefficient of 6, and then multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum over all terms in the second expansion, which is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems odd because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when the entire expression is expanded, but only considering the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, i.e., where the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That makes sense because then the coefficient would be a number.\n\nSo, let me try that approach. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I found earlier. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and multiply them together to get the final coefficient.\n\nOkay, so let's work on finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, we can expand this as:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when you multiply these two parts, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but only the term where \\(c^0\\) will result in a term that has \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and when expanding, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), etc., but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be a number. Therefore, my initial approach was correct, and the answer is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number, so I think the intended interpretation is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and I expand it, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m (1/c)^n\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m + n = 6\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(m - n\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), and the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(m - n\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) such that \\(m + n = 6\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a sum involving different powers of \\(c\\), which again suggests that the problem is asking for a specific term where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this by considering the entire expansion. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and each term in the second part. But since the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the expansion without any \\(c\\) terms, i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). That would make sense, so the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which we found to be 20, so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

If I apply the binomial theorem, the expansion will be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me check that: if \\(k = 2\\), then the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). The binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I think I'll need to use the binomial theorem here as well. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nWait, but in the original problem, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term is part of the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, actually, I'm being asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That means I can treat the two parts separately because the terms involving \\(c\\) won't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, is that right?\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since the first expression only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the variables are different. So, the terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by all the terms from the second part, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms.\n\nWait, but that doesn't sound right either. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the variables are independent, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply, each term in the first part's \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by each term in the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the variables \\(c\\) can be anything, so we just sum the coefficients from the second part.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier.\n\nNext, I need to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\), the expression becomes \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients is 64.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply. But in this case, the first expression's term is \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and the second expression is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so when you multiply, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of the two polynomials, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second polynomial, because the second polynomial doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, yes, that would make the coefficient 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. Is there a possibility that the second part could affect the coefficient? For example, if the second part had terms in \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), but it doesn't; it's only in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient will be the sum of all products where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second part. But since the second part's terms don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you have two independent variables, the coefficients multiply. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) in the product would be the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and \\(c^k\\) in the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that would mean we need to sum over all possible \\(k\\). So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second part, which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and since the second part is a separate polynomial, when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but maybe I should also check the expansion of the second part to make sure I'm not making a mistake there. Let me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nEach term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\), so the coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for each power of \\(c\\). The sum of all coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I'm not missing anything, let me consider another approach. Maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product and look for the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second part. Since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to write out the product, it would be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\left(\\text{terms involving } a \\text{ and } b\\right) \\times \\left(\\text{terms involving } c\\right)\n\\]\n\nSince the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are independent of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64.\n\nSo, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem.\n2. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n3. Find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives 64.\n4. Multiply the two results: 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that seems solid. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Multiplying these gives 6 * 64 = 384.\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLet me start by expanding \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion will be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I'm interested in the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\).\n\nNow, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to figure out how this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but hold on, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so when I multiply the two expressions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will multiply each term in the expansion of the second part. But since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second expression doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), does that mean that the coefficient from the second part doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first part, and the second part has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), when I multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). However, since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, I think that means I just need to consider how many times \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, which would be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a single term. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that can't be right because the second part doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because it's not present. Alternatively, maybe it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Hmm, that might be the case. So, if that's the situation, then the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part, but since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. Wait, that doesn't seem right because the second expansion has multiple terms.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply the two expressions, every term in the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it just contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient.\n\nWait, but that might not be the case. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product. But in the product, each term is a product of terms from each part. So, \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times each coefficient from the second part adds up. But wait, that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion.\n\nBut wait, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too high. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, another approach: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, each contributing their own coefficient, so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second part). Since the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, as I calculated before, then 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be the same as 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would result in a polynomial where each term is 6 times a term from the second part multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the second part doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term's coefficient because it's multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). But no, when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part gets multiplied by each term in the second part, each of which is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second part. But if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to approach it differently. Let's consider that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the terms are all combinations of terms from each polynomial. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by each coefficient from the second part. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, but that would be the case if we were summing over all possible \\(c\\) terms, but perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6*64=384.\n\nBut wait, let me check this with a smaller example to see if this approach is correct. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we have \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, but according to my earlier approach, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 1 (from \\((a + b)^2\\) where the term is \\(2ab\\), but wait no, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from multiplying \\(a^2\\) with \\(b^2\\), but in the first expansion, the highest power is \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\), but in reality, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), so there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the coefficient is zero, which contradicts my earlier approach. Hmm, so perhaps my initial approach is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the product. That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which might not be the intended question.\n\nSo, if that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, let's think about that. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, as before, with coefficient 6. Then, to get \\(c^0\\), which is 1, in the second part, I need the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., the term where the exponent is zero.\n\nSo, how do I find that? Using the binomial theorem again, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the exponent to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that makes sense because in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in the second part, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20, so when you multiply them together, you get 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nLet me verify this with another approach. The entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and \\(c^0\\) comes from the second part. So, the coefficient is indeed the product of the two coefficients, which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, earlier I thought the coefficient might be 384, but that was when I was considering the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which would be the case if I was looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). But since the problem just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's more accurate to interpret it as \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), so the answer is 120.\n\nAlternatively, to make sure, let's consider the problem again. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" The way it's written, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which could be interpreted as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) because otherwise, the coefficient would be a sum over all possible exponents of \\(c\\), which seems unlikely. So, I think the intended answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check once more. If I expand both parts, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that would mean that in the product, every term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that's 6 times the corresponding coefficient from the second part. But if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without considering \\(c\\), then it's 384. However, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120.\n\nHmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me think about how the problem is phrased. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" The way it's written, it's possible that they just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384. But that seems a bit odd because typically, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term in a product, you're considering the term with all variables specified. So, perhaps the intended answer is 120, assuming that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\).\n\nWait, but let me check with another example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion is \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But if I were to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it would still be zero because \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present. Alternatively, if I consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's zero because \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in the first part, so when multiplied by the second part, it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, perhaps the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but in the earlier example, if I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first place. So, perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient is indeed 384 because \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part.\n\nWait, but that seems contradictory because in the first part, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a single term, so when multiplied by the second part, it would create multiple terms, each with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a different power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. So, perhaps the problem is ambiguous, but given the way it's written, I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nWait, but let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think about the structure of the product. When you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which has coefficients that sum up to 64 when \\(c = 1\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, that seems a bit counterintuitive because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a single term, but in the product, it's being multiplied by terms that have different powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\), where each coefficient corresponds to a different power of \\(c\\). Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's ambiguous whether it's asking for the entire coefficient polynomial or just the constant term (i.e., coefficient of \\(c^0\\)).\n\nGiven that, I think the intended interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120, as I calculated earlier. Because if it were asking for the entire coefficient, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), it would have specified that. So, I think the correct answer is 120.\n\nWait, to make sure, let me calculate both possibilities:\n\n1. Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\): 6 * 64 = 384.\n\n2. Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\): 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nGiven that the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), but just asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think the intended answer is 120, as it's more likely they want the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\).\n\nWait, but let me check the problem again. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" The way it's written, it's possible that they just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384. But I'm a bit unsure because usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term in a product involving multiple variables, you have to specify all the exponents. So, perhaps the problem is expecting 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is written incorrectly, and they meant to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). But without more context, it's hard to say. Given that, I think the most reasonable answer is 120, as it's more likely that they want the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, making the term \\(a^2b^2\\) stand alone without any \\(c\\) terms.\n\nTherefore, after all this thinking, I believe the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2 is when \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient for this term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " So maybe I can apply that here.\n\nAlright, so the first part of the expression is \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me expand that. Using the binomial theorem, each term in the expansion will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4.

Okay, that part seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the product of these two expansions. But wait, the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Because when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. However, since the problem is only concerned with the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), any term that comes from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by something involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) won't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the overall product. Because the variables \\(c\\) and \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) are separate, so the coefficients multiply but the variables remain distinct.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm thinking correctly. So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and I multiply it by, say, \\(c^k\\) from the second part, then the term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\). So actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply as well. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, no, that's not right either. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term can only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part by any term in the second part, regardless of what that term is. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the variables are different.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial, and I multiply it by any term from the second polynomial, say \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), then the resulting term will be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), I need to consider all the ways that multiplying terms from the two polynomials can result in \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). \n\nWait, but in the first polynomial, \\((a + b)^4\\), the terms only involve \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which involves \\(c\\), the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial by a term in the second polynomial that has \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in the second polynomial, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) is the coefficient we need. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already found to be 6. Now, we need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's work on that.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20 \\times 1 = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the first part gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives 20 for the constant term. So, when you multiply these, you get 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nBut hold on, I think I might have confused myself earlier. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the key point is that when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the terms that multiply together to give that specific term. So, in this case, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expression by a term that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) from the second expression. Since the second expression only involves \\(c\\), the only way to get a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is to multiply by the constant term in the second expression. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, that's not quite right because when you multiply by the entire expansion, you're actually distributing each term. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), we can consider that each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, that's not correct because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). But if I do that, then the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384, which is not the same as 120. So, I must have made a mistake in this reasoning.\n\nWait, so which approach is correct? Let me think again. When you have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's not quite right because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). However, since the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that's not standard because typically, when you ask for the coefficient of a term in a product of polynomials, you're considering the term with specific exponents for all variables. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's actually referring to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because otherwise, it's not a single term but an infinite number of terms if we consider all possible exponents of \\(c\\).\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, perhaps it's considering \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that's not standard because in polynomial expressions, each term has specific exponents for all variables. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, giving 120. That makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had said \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable\", then it would mean considering all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so it must be referring to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\).\n\nTherefore, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, giving 120.\n\nLet me just verify this with another approach. Suppose I consider the entire expansion. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if I wanted to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), it would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying \\(c\\), it's ambiguous. However, given the way the problem is phrased, it's likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nTo be thorough, let me compute the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, for the exponent to be 0, \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. Let me just recap:\n\n1. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\): which is 6.\n2. Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\): which is 20.\n3. Multiply them together: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nSo, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " So maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLet me focus on the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). If I expand this, the general term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which means I need \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let me find the value of \\(k\\) that gives me this term. If \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, looking at the second part of the expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). This also can be expanded using the binomial theorem. The general term here is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, it becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nBut wait, I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). That means I need the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is a constant term, right? Because if I multiply it by \\(a^2b^2\\), the result will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a constant. So, I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because \\(c^0 = 1\\), which is a constant.\n\nSo, let me set the exponent equal to zero: \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), I get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term in the second part is 20.\n\nNow, since the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part).\n\nCalculating that, \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 because \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). And in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which happens at \\(m = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} is 20. Multiplying them together gives 120. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. The key was to realize that for the entire term \\(a^2b^2\\) to be present without any \\(c\\) terms, the second part had to contribute a constant, which only happens when the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, which they do when \\(m = 3\\).

Let me consider the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions. So, when you expand \\((a + b)^4\\), you get terms involving a and b, and when you expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you get terms involving c and 1/c. So, when you multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first expansion, and it's multiplied by every term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But that seems like an unusual answer because it's a polynomial in c, not a single number.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me try to think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) as \\(6a^2b^2\\), and then it's multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times\\) the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in c.\n\nBut that seems odd because usually, when someone asks for the coefficient of a term in a product, they might be referring to the coefficient when considering all variables. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, which is 6, and the other part is just a separate factor. But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, the coefficients multiply as well.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the c terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me calculate that. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting c = 1, which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that would mean the coefficient is 384, but that seems high. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct because when you set c = 1, you get the sum of coefficients, which is 64, but in reality, each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when multiplied by 6, each term's coefficient would be 6 times that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times each term in the expansion, which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it again. Perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the other part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is just a separate factor, so the coefficient remains 6. But that seems inconsistent because when you multiply two expressions, each term's coefficient is the product of the coefficients from each part.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is 6 multiplied by each term in that expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in c. But the problem didn't specify any constraints on c, so maybe that's the answer.\n\nWait, but that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me try a different approach. Let's consider the entire expression as a product of two binomial expansions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) as \\(6a^2b^2\\), and then it's multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), meaning that the coefficient is a polynomial in c. So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms, so the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient to be 6, considering that the other part is just a separate factor, but that doesn't make sense when you multiply.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, ignoring the c terms. But that's not standard because in polynomial expressions, each variable's coefficient is considered separately. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but that seems too involved, and the problem might be expecting a numerical answer. Let me think again. Maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the other part is just a separate factor, so the coefficient remains 6. But that seems incorrect because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply as well.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) to be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the other part is just a separate factor, so the coefficient is 6. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient in the product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a number.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me check an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion would be (a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c. So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is (c + 1/c). Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) is also (c + 1/c). So, in this case, the coefficient of a term involving a or b is the entire expansion of the other factor.\n\nTherefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in c. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut wait, the problem didn't specify any constraints on c, so maybe that's the answer. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, which is 6, and the other part is just a separate factor. But in the example I did, the coefficient of a term was the entire expansion of the other factor, so I think that's the case here.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But let me check that again. When you expand \\((a + b)^4\\), you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2\\), and when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the product will be \\(6a^2b^2 \\times\\) each term from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but that seems like the coefficient is a polynomial, which might not be what the problem is asking for. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, which is 6, and the other part is just a separate factor, so the coefficient remains 6. But in the example I did earlier, the coefficient of a term was the entire expansion of the other factor, so I think that's the case here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all variables, which would require more steps. But I'm not sure. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire product, which would be the same as the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but that seems like the coefficient is a polynomial in c, which might not be what the problem is asking for. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient to be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be 6 times 64, giving 384. But that seems high, and I'm not sure if that's correct.\n\nWait, let me calculate the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of coefficients, we set c = 1, so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of coefficients is 64. So, if we take 6 times 64, that's 384. But that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384, but that seems incorrect because the sum of coefficients is when all variables are set to 1, but in reality, the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) are not all the same, so multiplying by 6 doesn't give the correct coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the sum of coefficients with the individual coefficients. The sum of coefficients is 64, but each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has its own coefficient. So, when we multiply by 6, each term's coefficient becomes 6 times that coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in c.\n\nBut maybe the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, so perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible c terms, so the coefficient is a polynomial, which is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too involved, and the problem might be expecting a numerical answer.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the other part is just a separate factor, so the coefficient remains 6. But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply as well. So, if the other factor is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times that expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in c. Therefore, the answer is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's what the problem is expecting. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, which is 6, and the other part is just a separate factor, so the coefficient is 6. But that seems inconsistent with the example I did earlier.\n\nWait, let me try to think differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient to be 6, considering that the other part is just a separate factor. But in the example I did earlier, the coefficient was the entire expansion of the other factor, so I think that's the case here.\n\nTherefore, after all this thinking, I believe that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the final answer is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which can be written as \\(6\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me check again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) as \\(6a^2b^2\\), and then it's multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is \\(6\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but that seems like the coefficient is a polynomial, which might not be what the problem is expecting. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, which is 6, and the other part is just a separate factor, so the coefficient is 6. But that seems inconsistent with the example I did earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating c and 1/c as separate variables, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in c. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut let me think again. When you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients from each polynomial. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) only comes from the first polynomial, so its coefficient in the product is the coefficient from the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in c.\n\nSo, after considering all these possibilities, I think the correct answer is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by taking the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and multiplying it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\n$\\boxed{6\\left(c+\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6}$"

    "text": " So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLet me start by expanding \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, that would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Calculating the coefficients, that becomes \\(1 \\cdot a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) here is 6. Okay, that part is clear.\n\nNow, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider how the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) interacts with the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). \n\nWait, but actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), maybe the coefficients involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't affect the coefficients involving \\(c\\). That is, when I multiply out the two expressions, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because then it would involve \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will contribute to the coefficient. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that might not be correct because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has different powers of \\(c\\), but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), maybe it's the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, the coefficients combine. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then each term in the expansion will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, if that's the case, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 64 (the sum of coefficients in the second expression), giving 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that each term in the product is a combination of terms from both expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a scalar. So that can't be right because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a scalar. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you multiply out the entire expression, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients for terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). \n\nSo, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute it another way. Let me consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, since \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and for each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which has coefficients that sum up to 64 when \\(c = 1\\), then the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible \\(c\\) terms would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but perhaps a better way is to realize that \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nSo, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). Now, when I multiply this by \\((a + b)^4\\), which has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), the product will have terms of the form \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for each \\(k\\). \n\nBut since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, as I thought earlier. So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me confirm that. The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in that expansion is 64. \n\nSo, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 64 (the sum of coefficients in the other polynomial), so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) being 6, and each term in the product will have this coefficient multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all terms is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me check this another way. Let's consider the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Expanding this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{m}a^{4 - m}b^m \\times \\dbinom{6}{n}c^{6 - n}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^n\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{m}\\dbinom{6}{n} a^{4 - m}b^m c^{6 - 2n}\\). \n\nNow, we're interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means we need \\(4 - m = 2\\) and \\(m = 2\\). So, \\(m = 2\\), and the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). \n\nNow, for each \\(n\\) from 0 to 6, the term will be \\(\\dbinom{6}{n}c^{6 - 2n}\\). Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum over all \\(n\\) the coefficients \\(\\dbinom{6}{n}\\), because each of these will be multiplied by 6. \n\nSo, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{n}\\) for \\(n = 0\\) to \\(6\\). But the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{n}\\) from \\(n=0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, that seems consistent. So, I think the answer is 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can approach it by considering that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), so it's just the product of the coefficients from each part. Since \\((a + b)^4\\) contributes 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) contributes its entire expansion, which when multiplied by 6 gives the coefficient. But to get the scalar coefficient, I need to consider that when you multiply by the entire expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nI think that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

I'm a bit confused here because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but this part of the expression involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Wait, does that mean the coefficient might be affected by this part as well? Or is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) independent of the \\(c\\) terms?\n\nLet me think. Since the expression is a product of two separate binomials raised to powers, \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when I multiply them together, each term in the expansion of the first will multiply each term in the expansion of the second. So, the overall expression will be the product of these two expansions.\n\nBut the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all, right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term (if any) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is there a constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\n\nLet me check. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). For there to be a constant term, the exponent must be zero. So, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\).\n\nOkay, so the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. That means when I multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion by this constant term, the result will be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\), and the term will be \\(120a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Are there any other terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that could affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? For example, could a term involving \\(c\\) multiply with a term involving \\(1/c\\) to give a constant, thereby contributing to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term? But no, because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the only way a term from the second expansion can affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is if it's a constant term. Otherwise, you'd end up with terms that have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), which would change the variables involved, and thus not contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.\n\nTherefore, the only contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, multiplied by the coefficient from the first expansion, which is 6. So, 6 times 20 is 120.\n\nLet me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First, I expanded \\((a + b)^4\\) and found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) correctly using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, I considered the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and correctly identified that the constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which happens at \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 120, which should be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression.\n\nI think that makes sense. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, the coefficient should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is given by:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe are interested in the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient for this term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is given by:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Solving \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) gives \\(m = 3\\). The constant term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first expansion and the constant term from the second expansion:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would be the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\).\n\nNow, I'm specifically looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That means I need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the expansion, I can find this term by plugging in \\(k = 2\\) because then \\(a^{4 - 2} = a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6.\n\nBut wait, the problem is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider both expansions. However, I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), involves variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't interact with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when I multiply the two expansions together, the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) will multiply with every term from the first expansion, but since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider that term separately.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm not missing something. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand this product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, as long as the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents are 2 each, their coefficient is what's being asked. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would actually be a combination of coefficients from both expansions.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that term would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), maybe the answer is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a specific term, which would have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. It says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", but in the entire expression, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various terms of \\(c\\), so perhaps the problem is considering the coefficient irrespective of \\(c\\), but that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right either.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me check the problem again: it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, perhaps it's considering the product as a single expression, and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), because the other part is multiplied by the entire expression. Wait, no, that can't be. Let me think of it this way: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier, and then when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is another polynomial, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), setting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high. Wait, let me check that again.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term has a coefficient, and the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term would be 6 times each coefficient. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all those products. But wait, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large. Alternatively, maybe I'm misinterpreting the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a sum of multiple terms. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nOkay, that makes more sense. So, let me adjust my approach. I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, first, I'll find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply those two coefficients together.\n\nSo, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 * 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, since we're looking for the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)) equals 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), but now I'm considering that it's asking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps it's considering the coefficient as a number, irrespective of \\(c\\). Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial, not a single number. So, that can't be.\n\nTherefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, that would be 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. If I consider the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's ambiguous whether it's considering the coefficient irrespective of \\(c\\) or specifically looking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). But given that \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), it's more likely that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you have two separate variables, \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is separate from \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term would be of the form \\(a^kb^l c^m\\), where \\(k + l = 4\\) and \\(m\\) varies based on the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. But the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that contradicts my earlier thought.\n\nWait, now I'm confused. Let me clarify: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by each term in the other polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is a specific term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out to zero. So, that would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is only considering \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and ignoring \\(c\\), but that seems unlikely because \\(c\\) is part of the expression. So, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Let's say I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). And \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). So, when I multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(20\\) gives \\(120a^2b^2\\), which is the term where \\(c^0\\). Similarly, \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(15c^2\\) gives \\(90a^2b^2c^2\\), and so on. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is indeed 120, while the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^2\\) is 90, etc. Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying \\(c\\), it's ambiguous, but given the context, it's likely asking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. If the problem had said \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\)\" for some \\(k\\), then it would be clear. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe it's considering the coefficient as a polynomial in \\(c\\), which would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. Therefore, I think the intended answer is 120, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\).\n\nSo, to summarize: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. Therefore, the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nI think I've got it now. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120, which is the answer to the problem.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

If I expand this using the binomial theorem, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\). I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, let me compute that coefficient. \n\nThe binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as \\(4! / (2! * (4 - 2)!)\\), which is \\((4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / (2 * 1 * 2 * 1)\\). Simplifying that, it's \\(24 / 4 = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider how this affects the coefficient I just found. Wait, actually, no. Because the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which involves variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, perhaps the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, that means I need to consider the expansion of both \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then find the product where the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are squared, and the \\(c\\) terms are whatever they are, but since the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the other variables' coefficients just get multiplied in as a constant factor.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me clarify. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand both parts, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps we can treat the two parts separately. That is, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and then multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so if I'm looking for a specific term in the product, I have to consider that the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe the coefficient is just the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the entire expansion of the second part. But that can't be right because the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so when you multiply, you'll get terms with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) alone would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, multiplied by 6.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct either. Let me try to think more carefully.\n\nWait, actually, no. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems like the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is not the case because each term in the second expansion is a separate term.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion, each time with different powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part contributes a coefficient that gets multiplied by 6 (the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part).\n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), right? Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, that seems plausible, but let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would indeed be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again: if I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c), then the coefficient of a specific term in P(a, b) times Q(c) would be the coefficient in P(a, b) times the sum of coefficients in Q(c), because each term in Q(c) is multiplied by the term in P(a, b). So yes, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this differently. Let me expand both parts separately and then see how they multiply.\n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\n\\]\nCalculating the coefficients:\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} = 1\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} = 1\\)\n\nSo, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nNow, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand this using the binomial theorem as well:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply the two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), as I thought earlier. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me check once more to make sure I'm not making a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the coefficient being 6 times each term in the second expansion, but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the 6 from the first part gets multiplied by the entire second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nYes, that seems to make sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check again: when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each of these, I get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), contributing to different powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nSince the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64, as calculated before, then the coefficient is indeed \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me check: if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = 64\\), so the entire second part becomes 64 when \\(c = 1\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient in the first part times 64, which is 6 * 64 = 384. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute it another way. Let me compute the entire expansion step by step.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nSecond, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is:\n\n- \\(k = 0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1 \\times c^6\\)\n- \\(k = 1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^4 = 6c^4\\)\n- \\(k = 2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^2 = 15c^2\\)\n- \\(k = 3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\\)\n- \\(k = 4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(k = 5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(k = 6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in:\n\n- \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\)\n- \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\)\n- \\(90a^2b^2c^2\\)\n- \\(120a^2b^2\\)\n- \\(90a^2b^2c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(36a^2b^2c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, each of these terms will appear in the product. Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, looking at the terms above, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in all these terms, each multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). But when the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the \\(c\\) exponents. Therefore, the total coefficient would be the sum of all these coefficients:\n\n6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n6 + 36 = 42\n\n42 + 90 = 132\n\n132 + 120 = 252\n\n252 + 90 = 342\n\n342 + 36 = 378\n\n378 + 6 = 384.\n\nSo, that confirms it: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384.\n\nWait, so that's consistent with my earlier calculation where I took the coefficient from the first part (6) and multiplied it by the sum of coefficients from the second part (64), giving 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient to the product with \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total is 6 multiplied by each of those coefficients and then summed up, which is the same as 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem to expand each part separately and then combine the results.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nThe sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives:\n\\[\n\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficient from the first expansion and the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion:\n\\[\n6 \\times 64 = 384\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

Using the binomial theorem, this would be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\n\nI need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I should find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That means I need to find the value of \\(k\\) such that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me check: if \\(k = 2\\), then \\(4 - 2 = 2\\), so yes, that's the term I want.\n\nSo, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2! \\cdot (4 - 2)!} = \\dfrac{24}{2 \\cdot 2} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. But wait, the original problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so I also have another part to consider, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, does this affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think.\n\nI think not, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, when you multiply two expressions, the variables are independent. That is, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will contribute terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the other part might just be multiplied as a constant factor. Wait, but actually, no, because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, maybe I need to consider the product of the two expansions.\n\nBut wait, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps I can treat the two parts separately. Let me clarify: when I expand \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it's equivalent to multiplying each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider that term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the other variable terms won't affect it. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from the other expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not correct either because each term is multiplied separately.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I expand both parts separately, the product will be a sum of terms where each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of those of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But actually, no, because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is a term like \\(6a^2b^2\\), and when you multiply it by each term in the other expansion, you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\text{something}\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but that seems a bit off. Let me think again. When you have two independent variables, the coefficient of a specific term in one variable is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each part. But in this case, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are in one part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by every term from the second part, each contributing their own coefficients, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms don't matter, so we sum all coefficients from the second part and multiply by 6.\n\nBut wait, actually, no. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those terms has a coefficient, and when you collect like terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Alternatively, perhaps it's simpler to note that the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which would make each term equal to its coefficient. So, let's compute that.\n\nLet me compute \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) when \\(c = 1\\). Then, it becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) times 64 (sum of coefficients in the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me check if that makes sense. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's 6 times the entire expansion, but that doesn't make sense because each term in the product would have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents and \\(c\\) exponents. Wait, no, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, every term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) would contribute to the coefficient. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Let me take a simpler example to verify. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b /c\n\\]\n\nNow, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is the coefficient of \\(a\\) times the sum of coefficients in the second part. Wait, but in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 2 (since when \\(c = 1\\), it's 2). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 1 * 2 = 2, but looking at the expansion, the terms with \\(a\\) are \\(a c\\) and \\(a /c\\), so the coefficients are 1 and 1, so the total coefficient is 2. That matches. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would be 1 * 2 = 2, which is correct because \\(b c\\) and \\(b /c\\) each have coefficient 1.\n\nSo, applying this to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the answer should be 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6. But that can't be right because the entire expression is a product, so each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the other expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach this differently. Let me think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one set of variables is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since the second polynomial is in a different set of variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, because every term in the second polynomial gets multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I calculated earlier, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of it as the product of two independent expansions. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and since the second part can be any term, the total coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Another way to think about it is that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is the product of that coefficient and the sum of all coefficients in the other polynomial. So, yes, that would mean 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with another example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get:\n\n\\[\n(a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c) = a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the first part times the sum of coefficients in the second part. The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the first part is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 2, so 1 * 2 = 2, which matches the terms \\(a^2c\\) and \\(a^2/c\\), each with coefficient 1, so total 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2 (from the first part) times 2 (sum of coefficients in the second part), giving 4, which matches the terms \\(2abc\\) and \\(2ab/c\\), each with coefficient 2, so total 4. So, this seems to confirm that the method is correct.\n\nTherefore, applying this to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 (from the first part) times 64 (sum of coefficients in the second part), which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. Is there another way to interpret the problem? For instance, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning it wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\). But the problem as stated is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would include all possible powers of \\(c\\), which would mean summing over all coefficients from the second expansion, leading to 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would need to find the corresponding term in the second expansion. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I'm confusing the concept. Let me consider the entire expression as a product of two polynomials. The first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), ..., \\(c^{-6}\\), each with their own coefficients. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), as I did earlier, which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me compute the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) another way. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nThe sum of coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), and the sum is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\nWhich confirms my earlier result.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. 6 times 64: 6*60=360, 6*4=24, so 360+24=384. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, after all that, I think the coefficient is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem and properties of polynomial multiplication.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   Thus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion can be found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " So maybe I can apply that here.\n\nThe expression is a product of two binomials raised to powers: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but I'm only asked about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), right? So maybe the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), because it's multiplied by other terms. Hmm, but actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second. So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I might need to consider all the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that are multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term from the first part, so maybe the second part contributes a factor that's multiplied by it. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps I can treat the two parts separately and then multiply the coefficients.\n\nWait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. The entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So when you expand this, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, for example, a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that means I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of c. So actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because then the coefficient would depend on c terms, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of the other part. Wait, no, that can't be because the entire expansion is a polynomial in c and 1/c, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a polynomial in c. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating c as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be a combination of terms from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify. Let me try to approach this systematically. First, let's expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). We want the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So when we multiply these two, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's referring to the coefficient in the entire product, considering all possible c terms. Wait, but that might not make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term independent of c. So perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in c, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So perhaps it's considering the entire expression as a product, and \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a part of it, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems odd because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire product, but only looking at the terms where the c terms cancel out or something. Hmm, maybe I need to approach this differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating c as another variable, so the coefficient would be a sum over all the possible products of terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't seem right either because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has its own coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the expression is a product of two polynomials. The first polynomial is in a and b, and the second is in c and 1/c. So, when you multiply them, the terms in a and b are independent of the terms in c. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, but here it's multiplied by a polynomial in c. So perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because that's the only term that would result in a constant when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term from the second expansion would be the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering only the constant term in c.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the constant term from the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6.\n\nOkay, so let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of c is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for k, we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20.\n\nSo, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in the second part), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. So when you multiply these together, you get 6 * 20 = 120. So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. Let me just verify the steps again. First, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of c is 0. That happens when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so k=3, and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. So yes, the coefficient is 120.\n\nI think that's the correct approach. So the final answer should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   The general term in the expansion is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   We need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), which occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\).
