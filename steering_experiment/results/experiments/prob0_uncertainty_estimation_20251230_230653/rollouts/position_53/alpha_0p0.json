    "text": " / (3! * 3!) = (720) / (6 * 6) = 720 / 36 = 20. Correct. So, 6 * 20 is indeed 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by multiplying the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) with the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, these coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\) and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), respectively. Multiplying them gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"
