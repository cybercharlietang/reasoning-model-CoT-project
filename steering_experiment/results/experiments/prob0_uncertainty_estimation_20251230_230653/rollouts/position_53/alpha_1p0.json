Alternatively, maybe I can think of it another way to confirm. Let me consider expanding both parts separately and then see how the terms combine. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) expands to \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). And \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). Now, when I multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will multiply each term in the second polynomial. However, only the constant term (20) in the second polynomial will not involve \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it gives \\(20a^2b^2\\). The other terms in the second polynomial have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so they would produce terms like \\(20a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(15a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but these are not the term we're interested in because they have \\(c\\) in them. So, the only term contributing to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is \\(20a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 20 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, giving 120. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Wait, actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by \\(20\\) (the constant term), you get \\(120a^2b^2\\). The other terms from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would give terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(15a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but these are different terms and don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, the coefficient remains 120. I think that's correct. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part. \n\n1.

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of c, we need to ensure that the c terms cancel out, meaning the exponent of c is zero.

    "text": " / (3! * 3!) = (720) / (6 * 6) = 720 / 36 = 20. Yes, that's correct. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it another way. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanding, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents for \\(c\\), that's \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as before. So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Then, the term from the second part must be when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), giving a coefficient of 20. So, the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Yep, that seems consistent.
