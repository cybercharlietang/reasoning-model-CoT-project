    "text": " / (3! * 3!) = 720 / (6 * 6) = 720 / 36 = 20. Correct. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Yep, that's right. So, I think I've got it. The coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\). \n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   We need the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0). Using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   Setting the exponent equal to 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients**:\n   Multiply the coefficients from both parts:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer**: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."
