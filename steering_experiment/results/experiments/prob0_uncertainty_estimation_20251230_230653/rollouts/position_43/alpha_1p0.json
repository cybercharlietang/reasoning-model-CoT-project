    "text": " Because when m=3, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{6-6} = 20c^0 = 20\\). So, when you multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will multiply the 20 from the second part, giving \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but let me think again. When I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion multiplies each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we only consider the term in the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\), because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), making the product have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is not zero, which we don't want. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), that's correct. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). We set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), correct. So, 6 times 20 is 120, yes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about the entire expansion. Let me consider the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanding this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^{k} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents on \\(c\\), it's \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, if I'm looking for the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), that means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, for the second part, since we're looking for \\(c^0\\), as before, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the term is \\(6 \\times 20 \\times a^2b^2 \\times c^0 = 120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120. So, yeah, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Is there another term in the expansion that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without involving \\(c\\)? For example, if there was a term with \\(c^1\\) and another with \\(c^{-1}\\), but when multiplied together, they would give \\(c^0\\). But in this case, since we're multiplying by each term separately, no, because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion by the \\(c^0\\) term from the second expansion. Any other terms would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which we don't want. So, I think 120 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials and consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, and the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero. So, yeah, that's consistent with what I did before.\n\nWait, another way to think about it is that since the two parts are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term (i.e., the coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) in the second part. So, 6 times 20 is 120. So, that's another way to see it.\n\nI think I've checked it enough times. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from each part:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.

Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are determined by the first part, and the exponents of \\(c\\) are determined by the second part. So, when looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), we're only concerned with the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and we can ignore the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, but wait, no, because we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, it's the coefficient from the first part times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20. So, yeah, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but another thought: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply term by term. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\), then the product is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^4 \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{4}{k} \\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we're interested in the term where \\(a^{4 - k}b^k = a^2b^2\\), which implies \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\). Then, the exponent of \\(c\\) in that term would be \\(6 - 2m\\). But since we're looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, we must have \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 * 20 = 120\\). So, that confirms it again.\n\nI think I've checked it enough ways, and each time I get 120. So, I'm pretty confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\).

The coefficient for this term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient for this term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."
