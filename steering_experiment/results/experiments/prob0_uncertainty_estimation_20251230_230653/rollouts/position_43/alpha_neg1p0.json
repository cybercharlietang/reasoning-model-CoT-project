    "text": " Multiplying them together gives 120. That seems correct. I don't think I made a mistake here. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\nWait, hold on a second. Let me make sure I didn't overlook anything. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion and the \\(c^0\\) term in the second expansion. So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about it another way. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is exactly what I did. So, I think 120 is the correct answer.\n\nWait another thought: sometimes, when dealing with products, you might have to consider cross terms, but in this case, since we're looking for a specific term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only need the term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\). So, yeah, 20 is correct, and 6*20 is 120.\n\nI think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

So, any other terms from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would involve \\(c\\) raised to some power, which would make the entire product term have a \\(c\\) component, but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), we can ignore those. Therefore, only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\), and that's why we multiplied 6 by 20. So, I think that makes sense.

    "text": " So, when you multiply these two expansions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and \\(c^0\\) in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Let me just think if there's another way to approach this problem. Alternatively, I could expand both parts separately and then multiply them, but that would take more time. Since I'm only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), focusing on the specific terms makes sense. Another way to look at it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's only affected by the constant term in the second polynomial. So, yes, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.
