    "text": " Let me think again. When I multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. But since we're only interested in the terms that result in \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are not present in the second expression, which is in terms of \\(c\\), then actually, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expression, the \\(a^2b^2\\) part remains the same, and the \\(c\\) terms just tag along. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2\\) times some function of \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Oh, wait, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you expand the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient for each such term (like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\)) will be 6 times the corresponding coefficient from the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe it's just 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that can't be right either because the coefficients from the second expansion are specific to each power of \\(c\\). So perhaps the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems off because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering all possible coefficients across different powers of \\(c\\). Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only interested in the term \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, but that's not possible because the second factor introduces \\(c\\) terms. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 would be 384. But wait, that seems too high. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient isn't a single number. I'm getting confused here. Let me try a different approach. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire product, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem doesn't specify, so maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so that would be \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, 6 times 64 is 384. But wait, that seems too large. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, but since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, the coefficient would just be 6 times each term in the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expansion. But that would mean the coefficient isn't a single number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the part without \\(c\\), but that's not possible because the second factor introduces \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I should approach it differently. Let me consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) times \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). But that means the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right for the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a single number. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), we need to find the sum of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) where \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\) and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. But the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), it just said \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, maybe the problem is assuming that we're considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. But that seems high, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) and not worrying about the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient is just 6. But that seems too simple. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But again, that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a single number. I'm getting confused because the problem is a bit ambiguous. Let me try to clarify: The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a single number. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's 6 times the entire expansion, but that would mean the coefficient isn't a single number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that again would be a polynomial. I think I need to approach this differently. Let me consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and it's multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, so if the problem is asking for the coefficient, it's expecting a numerical value. Therefore, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire product as a single polynomial, and the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But I'm not entirely sure if that's what the problem is asking for. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be 6 times \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), since \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\) must equal \\(c^0\\), so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), \\(m = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, 6 times 20 is 120. That seems more plausible because it's a specific coefficient for the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that it's 6 times the entire expansion, but that seems unlikely. I think the most reasonable interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120. So, I'll go with that.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion is found by considering the term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the corresponding term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that results in \\(c^0\\). \n\n1. From \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. From \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. This occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiply these coefficients together: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), because when you multiply the two expansions, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) by the \\(c^0\\) term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\), you'd get a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the coefficients from the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), so in the product, it would be multiplied by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second expansion. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's work on that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here.

So, that would be 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check my reasoning to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First, I correctly identified that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6 using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Then, I considered the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and realized that to get a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the exponent of \\(c\\) must be zero. I set up the equation \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which correctly gave me \\(m = 3\\). Then, I calculated \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) as 20, which is correct. Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120, which seems right. So, I think my answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In the expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients together, \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Wait, actually, the entire expression is a product of two expansions, so when you multiply them, each term in the first expansion will multiply each term in the second expansion.

But wait, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and when you expand this, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. So, in this case, since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that term would come from taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiplying it by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but is that correct? Let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the product would have factors of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's actually the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, but since we're considering the entire product, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, no, that's not right because the product would have terms involving \\(c\\) as well. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you'd get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that can't be right because \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't a term that includes \\(c\\), so unless the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, but that's not happening here. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's the sum of all coefficients where the term is \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because the coefficient would then be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable as well, but only considering terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), which isn't a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a number. So, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, meaning that it's the sum of all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't sound right either because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression. Hmm, perhaps the problem is actually only considering the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, meaning that the term is a constant with respect to \\(c\\). So, in that case, we'd need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is a constant, i.e., where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times that constant term. Let me try that approach. So, first, I'll find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, that seems plausible. So, the logic is that since we're looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to multiply it by the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. I think I've got it now. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too high. Wait, no, that's not correct because the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) are not all the same. Each term has a different coefficient, and when you multiply by 6, you're just scaling the entire expansion by 6, which isn't the case here. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, which suggests that it's considering all terms regardless of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me think differently. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because otherwise, if it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But maybe the problem is expecting just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is multiplied by something else. Wait, no, the expression is a product, so each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the sum of coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me verify this by another approach. Let's consider that \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Now, when we multiply this by \\((a + b)^4\\), which has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), the entire product will have terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial multiplies all the terms in the other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that would be different. In that case, we would need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. But since the problem is just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying \\(c\\), I think it's expecting the sum over all possible \\(c\\) exponents, which would be 384. Wait, but I'm a bit confused now. Let me check an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). Now, if I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), then each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\text{(terms in }c)\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. Alternatively, if the problem had specified a particular power of \\(c\\), like \\(c^0\\), then the coefficient would be different. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n$\\boxed{384}$"

But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we need to find all the terms in the second expression that don't involve \\(c\\), i.e., the constant term. Because if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term involving \\(c\\), it would introduce \\(c\\) terms, which we don't want. So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, we need to take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, which is 6, and multiply it by the constant term (the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) from the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me apply the binomial theorem again here. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).

Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficient from the first part (6) and the constant term from the second part (20). So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake.

That seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as the product of two expansions, and when you multiply them, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. But since we only care about \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider only the terms in the first expansion that contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\), which is just 6, and then the terms in the second expansion that are constants, which is 20.

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Hmm, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the term where \\(k = 2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), and that term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). Now, when you multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you get \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the numerical coefficient, not the powers of \\(c\\), we can consider that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I thought earlier, the sum of the coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but let me check that another way. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and when multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get terms like \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), which is \\(6 \\times 2^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\).

Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a constant term, it remains \\(a^2b^2\\), but if you multiply it by a term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), it would become something like \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), which are different terms.

When we expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But wait, that would mean the coefficient is a sum involving \\(c\\) terms, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient, which is a number. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but since \\(c\\) is separate, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems odd. Wait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a product, and when you multiply it out, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would include all the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a sum involving \\(c\\). But maybe I'm supposed to treat \\(c\\) as a separate variable and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), multiplied by 6. Wait, that seems plausible. Let me think: The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. Then, when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems to be the case. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, so perhaps I'm supposed to write it as 6 times the expansion. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, but that doesn't make sense because \\(c\\) is involved. Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that would be impossible because \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, each term would have some power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. Because if we consider the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which has terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), that would make sense, because then we're looking for the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, leaving \\(c^0\\). That seems likely. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the coefficient when the exponents of \\(c\\) sum to zero.

So, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's work on that. Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem: \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\): \\(6 = 2k\\) \u21d2 \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term) multiplied by 20 (from the \\(c^0\\) term), which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives \\(c^0\\) with coefficient 20. So, when you multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but only the term with \\(c^0\\) contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\).

Wait, no, because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you're effectively taking each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiplying it by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) would be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that coefficient would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire sum of the coefficients in the second part. Wait, that might not be correct because each term in the second part has different powers of \\(c\\), but when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second part, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the product, but when multiplied by the second expression, which has \\(c\\) terms, the resulting terms will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and \\(c\\). So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, but that's not how polynomial terms work. Each term has specific exponents for each variable. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), meaning that we can treat the second part as a scalar multiple. Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, to find that, I need to find all terms in the expansion where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not correct because each term in the second expansion has a specific power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by 6, you'd be distributing 6 across all those terms, but actually, each term in the product would be \\(6 \\times\\) a term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward, and I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) being 6, and when multiplied by the entire expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion, meaning that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term, and then multiply that by 6. So, let me try that approach. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the constant term from the second expression, which is 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but earlier I thought it might be 384, but that was under the assumption that we're considering all terms, but actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only be the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, right? Because if we consider other exponents of \\(c\\), then the term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but the problem is just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply \\(c^0\\). So, perhaps the correct approach is to find the constant term in the second expression and multiply it by the coefficient from the first expression. So, that would be 6 times 20, which is 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. Therefore, when you multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, giving a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\).

    "text": " Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and not \\(c\\), that means in the multiplication, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term involving \\(c\\), the result would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something, which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by the constant term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I already found that the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m}\\), which is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(6 - 2m\\) on \\(c\\). We are looking for the term where the exponent is 0, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is the term when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, is that it? Let me double-check. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, giving a total coefficient of 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Hmm, that seems right. Let me think if there's any other way this could be approached. Alternatively, I could consider that the entire expression is a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficients multiply when the terms are multiplied. Since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we don't need to consider any cross terms with \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"
