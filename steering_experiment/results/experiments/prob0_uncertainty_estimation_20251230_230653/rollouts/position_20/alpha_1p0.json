    "text": " Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, actually, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps all the \\(c\\) terms will just multiply together, but we can treat them as a separate part. Wait, no, because the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire product. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would mean that the \\(c\\) terms are part of the overall expression, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, perhaps. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the answer is just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But that seems too simple. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the entire expression is a product, and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part doesn't affect it because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would just be 6. But that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me try to think differently. When you have a product of two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in \\((a + b)^4\\), and in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), any term would be of the form \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expression, you'd get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only consider the terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6. Okay, that makes sense. So, let's compute the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\): \\(6 - 2k = 0 \\implies 2k = 6 \\implies k = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the answer should be 120. Let me just double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when you multiply these two, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (which doesn't involve \\(c\\)) would be 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations. So, I think the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But wait, no, that's not correct either. Because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and when multiplied by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it would result in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply that the term doesn't have any \\(c\\) factors. So, that would mean that we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because \\(c^0\\) is 1, and that's the only way the term \\(a^2b^2\\) wouldn't have any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) terms. So, I think that's the right approach. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply these two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, let me work on the second part: finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times c^{-k}\\), which is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(6 - 2k\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives a constant term (c^0) with coefficient 20. So, when you multiply these two parts, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, resulting in 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe I should think of the entire expression as the product of two polynomials, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but wait, no, that's not correct because each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way that happens is if we take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term and multiply it by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20. So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 * 20 is 120. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nI think that's the right answer.

Wait, no, that might not be correct. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients of the product are the convolutions of the coefficients of the original polynomials. So, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply by each term, you're adding up all the possible products.

So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear in the product as \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) for each \\(k\\), each with their own coefficients. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you're getting terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^5\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). So, does that mean we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\)? Or is it that the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms? Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, the expression is a product of two polynomials, and we're looking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\). But in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you're just scaling it by each of those coefficients. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that can't be right because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when you set \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems too high. Wait, no, that's not correct because when you set \\(c = 1\\), you get the sum of coefficients, but in reality, each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a term like \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term has a coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) and a power of \\(c\\) which is \\(6 - 2k\\). So, when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get terms like \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. But wait, that seems too large. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product comes only from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because in the product, each term is a combination of \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then yes, it would be 6 times 64. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) or something, then that's different. Wait, the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. So, 6 times 64 is 384. But let me check another way. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded as the product of two separate expansions. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I calculated before, that's 6 times 64, which is 384. So, is that the answer? Wait, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear multiplied by any power of \\(c\\).

So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, so 384. But wait, let me confirm by actually expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term has a coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) and a power of \\(c\\) which is \\(6 - 2k\\). So, when you multiply this by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). The sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) from \\(k=0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, yes, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, I think that's the answer. But wait, let me check if that makes sense. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part is just a constant factor. But no, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is not a constant; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply by it, you're scaling each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, so 384.

But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the result will have \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum over all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As I thought earlier, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64 when \\(c = 1\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of two independent expansions. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the rest comes from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since we're considering the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since we're just looking for the coefficient, not the term, it's multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64. So, yes, 6 times 64 is 384. Alternatively, maybe I can approach it differently. Let's expand both parts separately and then see how they multiply. First, \\((a + b)^4\\) has the expansion: \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}ab^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}b^4\\). As we saw earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well: \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k\\) from 0 to 6. Now, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) times any term in the second expansion will still be \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum over all possible coefficients from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As before, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient being the product of the coefficients from each part, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\). So, since the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. I think that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), whose sum of coefficients is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{384}\\)"

Because only then, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would the resulting term be \\(a^2b^2\\) times 1 (since \\(c^0 = 1\\)). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense. So, I need to find two things: 1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found as 6. 2. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on the second part. So, expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem: \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(c\\) equal to \\(6 - 2k\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\): \\(6 = 2k\\) \u2192 \\(k = 3\\). So, the term where \\(k = 3\\) is the constant term. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).

For example, if the second expansion had terms with \\(c^1\\) or \\(c^{-1}\\), would those combine with terms from the first expansion to give \\(a^2b^2\\) times something else?

So, let me break it down. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already found as 6. Next, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Once I have both coefficients, I can multiply them together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, let's tackle the second part: finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem for this. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(6 - 2k\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0, because that's \\(c^0\\). So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 120. Wait, but let me double-check that. So, I found that in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\) (which is just 1, since \\(c^0 = 1\\)) from the second part, scaled by 20. So, the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems correct. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that the entire expression is the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficients multiply when you're looking for terms that don't involve the other variables. So, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part and identifying the relevant coefficients.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 20.\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and then multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part? But that seems too big because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, not a polynomial. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the \\(c\\) terms don't affect it because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a separate variable. Wait, no, that's not right. Because when you multiply, the entire expression becomes a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right either because the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) are not constants; they depend on the powers of \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me try another way. Perhaps the question is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would just be 6, as calculated from \\((a + b)^4\\), and then multiplied by whatever the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is. Wait, no, that's not correct because the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms directly. Alternatively, maybe the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, so it's 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, if that's the case, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would require considering the entire expansion. But that would be complicated because \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has 7 terms. Wait, no, perhaps the problem is intended to consider that the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Hmm, maybe the problem is actually only about the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, and the \\(c\\) terms are irrelevant. But that can't be right because the expression is a product, so the \\(c\\) terms would affect the overall coefficient. Wait, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make more sense because then we can find the coefficient by considering both expansions. So, let me assume that the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply them together. Let's proceed with that assumption.\n\nFirst, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNow, for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but the original problem didn't specify the \\(c^0\\) term, it just said \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the product with \\(c\\) terms, but the question is only about \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. So, perhaps the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would require that the \\(c\\) terms are also considered, but that would make the coefficient a sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms, which seems odd. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms and ignoring the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient is just 6. But that seems unlikely because the expression is a product of two polynomials. I'm a bit confused here. Let me try to think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, the only logical conclusion is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve the \\(c\\) terms. But that would require considering the entire expansion, which is complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the \\(c\\) terms canceled out, so the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 would be 384. But that seems high, and I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Wait, but that would again be 6 times 64 = 384. Hmm, maybe that's the answer. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the \\(c\\) terms not affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so the coefficient is just 6. But that seems incorrect because when you multiply, the coefficients do combine. I'm getting a bit stuck here.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, the only way this makes sense is if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 times 20 = 120. So, I think that must be the intended answer. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. From \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. From \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, when you multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by \\(c^0\\) from the second part, giving \\(a^2b^2 \\times 20\\), and also multiplied by all other terms from the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that contradicts my earlier thought. Hmm, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, that would mean I have to consider all possible ways \\(a^2b^2\\) can be formed, which would require that the second factor contributes a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), i.e., \\(c^0\\). Because if the second factor contributes a term with \\(c^k\\), then the overall term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), so \\(k\\) must be 0. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. To find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we calculate \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think we can treat the second part as a constant factor when considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, that might not be correct because the second part does involve \\(c\\), but \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so maybe the coefficient from the second part is just a constant multiplier. So, perhaps the total coefficient is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but no, because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would mean we need to find the term in the second expansion that's a constant, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.

So, maybe I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\). That makes more sense. So, let me first find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do that, I can again use the binomial theorem. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.

    "text": " Let me think again. The entire expression is the product of two expansions: one in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply them together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think that term must come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if I take any other term from the \\(c\\) expansion, it would introduce a \\(c\\) term, which would make the overall term have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something, which isn't what we're looking for. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). How do I do that? Again, using the binomial theorem. Let me write that out. \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term in the second expansion is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion (which has a coefficient of 6) and the constant term from the second expansion (which is 20). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me double-check that. So, the first part gives 6, the second part gives 20, and since these are multiplied together, the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right.

    "text": " Let me think again. The entire expression is a product of two binomials, each raised to a power. So, maybe the \\(c\\) terms will contribute some coefficient, but since we're only interested in the term \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the \\(c\\) part can be considered as a constant multiple. Wait, but actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like a lot. Alternatively, maybe the \\(c\\) terms are irrelevant because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms.

Wait, is that correct? Let me check. Suppose I have two expressions, \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\). Then, the product \\(P(a, b) \\cdot Q(c)\\) will have terms where each term in \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\), because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient I'm looking for is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, how do I find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Well, the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\). So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I'll get the sum of the coefficients. Let's calculate that: \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again. Because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is being multiplied by \\((a + b)^4\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and when we multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient becomes 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the sum is 64, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct.

So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you'll get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for different values of \\(k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only come from the constant term in the second expansion because otherwise, the \\(c\\) terms would make it \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) instead of just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because that's the only term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), \\(6 = 2k\\) so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that when you multiply two expressions, each term is multiplied by each term. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes from \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term in the second part, which is 20. So, yes, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. I think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Combine the results:**\n   Multiply the coefficients from both parts:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, to get the term \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to take the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by every term in the second part. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), then when I multiply it by the entire second expression, it will just be \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that seems too broad. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, no, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the question is probably expecting a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I need to consider that when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that might not be correct either. Let me try to think differently. Let's denote the entire expression as the product of two binomials: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand the product, each term will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to take the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion, which has a coefficient of 6, and multiply it by every term in the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, does that mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? That seems a bit strange because usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term, you'd consider the coefficient in the entire expression. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Hmm, I'm confused now. Let me try to re-examine the problem. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps I'm supposed to treat \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) as separate variables and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has its own coefficient, and when multiplied by 6, each of those coefficients would contribute to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when combined with \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right either because the problem is probably expecting a specific number, not a sum. Maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But how do I find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expression is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, that seems plausible. Let me check that again. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), which is the sum of all coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure if that's correct because I'm not sure if the problem expects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by all the possible \\(c\\) terms, or if it's just the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient to be 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate variables, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, regardless of the \\(c\\) part. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts in the product. So, perhaps I need to think differently. Let me try expanding both parts separately and then see how the terms interact. So, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). Now, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion, which has a coefficient of 6, will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I thought earlier, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384. But I'm still a bit unsure because I'm not sure if the problem expects me to consider all the \\(c\\) terms or just treat them as separate variables. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the answer is simply 6 because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. But that doesn't seem right because the problem includes the entire product, so the coefficients would be multiplied together. So, I think the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient, perhaps it's expecting the coefficient to be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that when multiplying the two expressions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Wait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is likely expecting a number. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but considering that \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) can be combined in some way that affects the coefficient. Wait, but \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, so their exponents don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is simply 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the problem is probably expecting a specific number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and ignoring the \\(c\\) parts, so the coefficient is just 6. But that seems too simplistic. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would involve considering all possible combinations of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I need to reconsider my approach. Let me try to compute the entire product and see what the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is. So, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\), as I found earlier. Now, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expands to \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6 \\times (c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6})\\). But that means the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. As I calculated earlier, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64 when \\(c = 1\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Alternatively, if the problem is only asking for the coefficient from the first part, it's 6, but that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. So, I think the correct answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\). Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."
