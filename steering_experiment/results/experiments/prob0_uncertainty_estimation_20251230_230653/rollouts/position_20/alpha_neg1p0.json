    "text": " Each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will contribute a coefficient that multiplies the corresponding term from \\((a + b)^4\\). But since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) factors, maybe the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is just 1, or perhaps it's the sum of all coefficients? Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the terms where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms can be anything because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me think. Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\). So, the total coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, but is that accurate? Let me verify. Let me denote \\(A = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(B = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, the product \\(A \\times B\\) would have terms like \\((a^kb^{4 - k}) \\times (c^m c^{-6 + m})\\), but since we're only interested in terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\). Because each term in \\(B\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(A\\), and we're only interested in the terms where \\(A\\) contributes \\(a^2b^2\\), so we need to sum all the coefficients from \\(B\\) and multiply by the coefficient from \\(A\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), because that makes each term equal to its coefficient. So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\) into \\(B\\), I get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product \\(A \\times B\\) would be 6 (from \\(A\\)) multiplied by 64 (from \\(B\\)), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the coefficient of each term in \\(B\\) is some number, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by every term in \\(B\\), the total coefficient would indeed be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\), which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384. Hmm, that seems high, but maybe that's correct. Let me try another approach to confirm. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) separately, then find the product and identify the coefficient. But that would be more work. Alternatively, since the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and it doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps I can treat \\(c\\) as a separate variable and note that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), so it's just 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(B\\), which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. In this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the sum of coefficients in \\(B\\). The sum of coefficients in a polynomial \\(P(c)\\) is \\(P(1)\\). So, for \\(B = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). That's correct. So, the sum of coefficients in \\(B\\) is indeed 64. Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the terms in \\(c\\) such that the entire expression is a monomial, but no, the problem just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the answer should be 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with another approach. Let me compute \\((a + b)^4\\) and see what the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is, which is 6, as I found earlier. Now, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in this expansion has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) and a power of \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by this expansion, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384, as I calculated earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the product of the two polynomials. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will have a coefficient equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial because each term in the second polynomial contributes a factor that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, yes, that makes sense. Therefore, I think 384 is the correct coefficient.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) again: 4! / (2! * 2!) = (24)/(2 * 2) = 24/4 = 6. Correct. And \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. That seems correct.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by evaluating it at \\(c = 1\\), yielding \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these results gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply term by term. But since we're only interested in the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the rest of the terms come from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not right. Actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, if we're looking for a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms, that would only happen if the other part, from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), contributes a term that is 1, because \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1 = a^2b^2\\). But does \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) have a constant term? Let me check. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0, because that would be the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by 20 from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, is that right? Let me double-check. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when you multiply these two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first will be multiplied by 20, giving \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I should think about it differently. Suppose I consider the entire expansion. Each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in terms where the result has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but actually, no, because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, in the product, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is to have the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part multiplied by the constant term from the second part. So, yes, that would be 6 times 20, which is 120. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), then we would have to consider other terms, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), it's only when the \\(c\\) terms cancel out to 1.

So, first, I found the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent on \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term) multiplied by 20 (the constant term). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, let me just make sure I didn't miss anything. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6, correct. Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent is zero, which is when m=3, so that's 20. Multiplying them together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right.

When you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression.

So, let me calculate the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the term where the exponent is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that makes more sense. So, I think my initial thought was wrong because I considered the sum of all coefficients, but actually, we need the constant term because we don't want any \\(c\\) terms attached to \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the correct coefficient is 120. Let me double-check that. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(k = 3\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{6 - 6} = 20 c^0 = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 20. Then, multiplying by the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, gives 120. So, the final answer should be 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, if I think about the entire product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. But if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that's conflicting with the previous conclusion. So, which one is correct? Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product. But in the product, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term from the second expansion, which would be \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part contributes to multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by a coefficient. But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), and when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part has a coefficient that gets multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the sum of coefficients in the second part is indeed when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But earlier, I thought it was 120 by considering only the constant term. So, which is it? Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, each of which has its own coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that can't be right because the problem is likely expecting a different answer. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., the constant term. Let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. However, I'm now confused because earlier I thought it was 120. Let me try to clarify this. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all terms in the other polynomial. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, each of these terms has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they become terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all these coefficients, which is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems high. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), but I'm not entirely sure. Let me see if I can find a source or a similar problem to confirm. Wait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which means that it's part of the entire expansion, so each term in the product is a combination of terms from both expansions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But let me think about it differently. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second part, because when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not a numerical coefficient; it's a polynomial. Wait, that can't be right. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(c\\) is to the zero power. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term of the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120. That seems more plausible because if you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), you might be considering the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, making it a constant. So, I think the correct answer is 120. Let me confirm this. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs at \\(k = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. Yes, that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which occurs when \\(k = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n$\\boxed{120}$"

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. No, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But in this case, \\((a + b)^4\\) only has terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), while \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) only has terms involving \\(c\\).

Wait, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be, because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\".

But since \\(c\\) is in the second part, and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high. Let me check. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), which has a coefficient of 6. The rest of the expression is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which, when expanded, has terms involving various powers of \\(c\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because coefficients are numerical.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

The rest of the expression is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which, when expanded, has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), etc. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But again, that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. I'm confused. Maybe the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because \\(c^0\\) would mean that the term doesn't involve \\(c\\), so it's a constant. That way, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That makes sense because then we're only considering the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, leaving a constant. So, let's try that approach. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me calculate that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems reasonable. Let me double-check. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiplying them together gives 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120. That makes sense because when you multiply the two expansions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20, giving 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then finding the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

Wait, that doesn't make sense because \\(c\\) is a variable. Maybe the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient in terms of \\(c\\), so it's 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems too complicated. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is multiplied, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be 6 times \\(2^6\\) because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) sums up to \\(2^6\\) when \\(c = 1\\). Wait, but that's not correct because when you expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the sum of all coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to treat \\(c\\) as a separate variable and just find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, so maybe it's expecting a numerical value, but that doesn't make sense because \\(c\\) is a variable. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not quite right because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has different powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you'd get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would be the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. But wait, no, because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems like an expression rather than a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient when considering all variables together, but that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is separate from \\(c\\). Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me try a different approach. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\). Simplifying, that's \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we're interested in the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, for \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for the \\(c\\) part, we have \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not correct because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has different exponents of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get terms like \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a numerical coefficient. Wait, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), meaning that it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), which would be 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. But that seems unlikely because the expression includes both \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient to be a polynomial in \\(c\\), so it's \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems complicated, and the problem might just be asking for a numerical coefficient. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the problem is expecting the coefficient as a polynomial in \\(c\\), so it's 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems too involved, and usually, when such problems are posed, they might be expecting a numerical coefficient, perhaps when considering all variables together, but that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is separate from \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That would make sense because then we're looking for the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. So, in that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, let's approach it that way. So, the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the \\(c^0\\) term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, first, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), we can use the binomial theorem again. \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, that makes sense. So, the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but considering the entire product, which includes \\(c\\) terms. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only appear when multiplied by the \\(c^0\\) term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. This happens when \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients together, we get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), the other terms involving \\(c\\) would just be multiplied by 1, or perhaps the entire \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part is just a scalar multiple? Wait, no, that's not correct. Because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so when you multiply it by \\((a + b)^4\\), you're essentially taking each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiplying it by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that right? Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the sum of all coefficients when you expand it. Alternatively, the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a separate variable. So, when you multiply the two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be 6 times 64, which is 384. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as the product of two polynomials. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) has terms with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I calculated earlier, that's 6 times 64, which equals 384. So, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me confirm this by another method. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that when you have two independent variables, the coefficients multiply. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the middle term, which would be the constant term. So, maybe I should find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6. Let me try that. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the constant term is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That is, 6 times 20, which is 120. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 384. Now I'm confused. Which one is correct? Hmm, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But when you write the product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), etc., down to \\(c^{-6}\\). But when you collect like terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would require that the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, actually, the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 20, which equals 120. So, I think my second approach is correct, and the first approach was wrong because I incorrectly thought that all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) contribute, but actually, only the constant term contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term because otherwise, you'd have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), which isn't the same as \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the correct coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. This happens at \\(k = 3\\), giving the term \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).

Let me try to clarify. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the expression is a product, and we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, when we multiply the two expansions, the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a numerical value, not involving \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not possible because \\(a^2b^2\\) is only a part of the product. Actually, no, perhaps the problem is only considering the part where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 1 (i.e., the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then multiply it by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. So, let me work on finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, it becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, if I consider the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the constant term 20, so the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.

But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that term must come from the product where the \\(c\\) terms multiply to give a constant term, i.e., \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the term would have a \\(c\\) component, which isn't present in \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. When you have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the \\(c\\) part must cancel out, meaning the exponent of \\(c\\) must be zero. So, yes, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6, which is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me confirm that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, let me find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient from the second part is 20. Now, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check my reasoning. So, the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), when expanded, gives \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Then, the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms with exponents of \\(c\\) going from 6 down to -6 in steps of 2. The term where \\(c^0\\) is when \\(m = 3\\), so that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{6 - 2*3} = 20c^0 = 20\\). So, when we multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by 20, giving 6 * 20 = 120. So, yes, that seems correct. I think I did it right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two expansions, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way that term can appear is when we take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and the constant term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed the product of the two coefficients, which is 6 * 20 = 120.

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, actually, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But wait, that can't be, because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for a coefficient, which is a number. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps they're treating \\(c\\) as a variable, and the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a term that includes all the possible terms from the \\(c\\) expansion multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so when you multiply by the \\(c\\) terms, you would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear is if it's multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1? Because otherwise, it would have some power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense.

So, the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanding, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, which are terms like \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the coefficient when the power of \\(c\\) is zero, because otherwise, it would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something else. So, yes, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me figure that out. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake.

So, when we expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) might not affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, that can't be right because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But wait, that doesn't sound correct either. Let me try to clarify. Let me denote \\(A = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(B = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then the product \\(A \\times B\\) would be a sum of products of terms from \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). So, each term in \\(A\\) is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to 4, and each term in \\(B\\) is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to 6. Now, when we multiply \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), each term in \\(A\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(B\\), so the terms in the product will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need to find all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each. That means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as I found earlier. So, for \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient from \\(A\\) is 6. Now, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\(A \\times B\\), and the terms involving \\(c\\) are separate, perhaps the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but that can't be because each term in \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\). Because when you multiply \\(A\\) by \\(B\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me think. If I have a term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from \\(A\\) and then multiply it by each term in \\(B\\), which is a sum of terms like \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\), then the product would be \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\right)\\), which would be \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\right)\\). So, each term in \\(B\\) is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\). Wait, but that would be 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to 6. The sum of the binomial coefficients for \\(n = 6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but that seems too high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the \\(c\\) terms are separate, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from \\(A\\) times the coefficient from \\(B\\) for each term, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only term that would contribute is when the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, i.e., when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, in \\(B\\), the term where \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\). So, the coefficient from \\(B\\) for \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\(A \\times B\\) would be 6 (from \\(A\\)) times 20 (from \\(B\\)) which is 120. Hmm, that seems more reasonable. Let me verify this. So, in \\(A\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(B\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20 because \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when we multiply these two parts, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\), but only the term where \\(c^0\\) contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term without any \\(c\\) component. So, the total coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense because the other terms in \\(B\\) would introduce powers of \\(c\\), so they wouldn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term's coefficient when we're considering the entire product. So, I think the correct coefficient is 120. Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). 6 choose 3 is indeed 20 because 6! / (3!3!) = (720)/(6*6) = 720/36 = 20.

So, perhaps we can treat \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as a separate expansion, and since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term independent of \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients don't just add up like that. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I expand each part separately, then the product will have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^n\\), where \\(m + n = 6\\). But since we're only interested in the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which is \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because the problem doesn't specify any \\(c\\) terms, so we can consider the coefficient as the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that might not be correct because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would contribute to different powers of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would create terms with different powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that \\(c^0\\) term. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. So, I need to compute two things: 1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I found to be 6. 2. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply these two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, let's compute the second part. The expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand this using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is 120.\n\nWait a second, let me just double-check that. So, we have \\((a + b)^4\\), and we found the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(k=3\\), so that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{6 - 6} = 20 c^0 = 20\\). So, when we multiply these two parts, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the terms where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient would indeed be 6 * 20 = 120. So, yes, that seems correct.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, and when you multiply this by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. However, since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, perhaps the problem is considering all terms, but only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That is, it's possible that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) could be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by 6a\u00b2b\u00b2. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which seems odd because the problem is likely expecting a numerical value. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Wait, no, the problem just says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. However, the problem might be expecting a numerical coefficient, which suggests that perhaps I'm misinterpreting it. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because usually, when they ask for the coefficient of a specific term, they might be considering the entire expansion and looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a specific power of \\(c\\), but since it's not specified, maybe it's just 6 times the entire expansion. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. Maybe the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the other expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like an expression, not a number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's not correct because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is separate. Wait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) where the power of \\(c\\) is zero. That is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by 6. Let me check that approach. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me calculate that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the final coefficient is 120. Wait, that makes sense. So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. That way, when you multiply them, you get the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Let me just double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120. Yes, that seems correct. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with those involving \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product, but since \\(c\\) terms are separate, the coefficient would just be the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. When you have two separate expressions multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the term \\(1\\) (or any constant term) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is being multiplied by \\((a + b)^4\\), so the entire expression is a product of two polynomials. So, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to consider how many ways we can get \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that might be the case. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\) (which is 1), you get \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term we're interested in. So, I need to find two things: 1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found to be 6. 2. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply these two coefficients together to get the final coefficient in the product expression. So, let me work on finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me just double-check that. So, the idea is that when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the terms that multiply together to give that specific term. In this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that doesn't involve \\(c\\) either, which is the constant term \\(c^0\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, I'm confident that the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by multiplying the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3.

Let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, first, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed the middle term, which is 6. Then, for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs at \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, yes, multiplying them together gives 120. I think that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the relevant terms from each binomial expansion.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   - The term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   - The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) occurs when \\(m = 3\\), giving a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients**:\n   - The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."
