    "text": " Now, since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can find the specific term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each. That would happen when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\) and \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). So, solving \\(4 - k = 2\\) gives \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. Now, the original expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient. Wait, actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the second part, when I multiply these two expressions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will multiply with the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can actually ignore the second part because the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will multiply every term in the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the other variables don't affect it. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial multiplies each term in the second polynomial. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the variables are independent. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will multiply each term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not any specific term involving \\(c\\), I think that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the terms involving \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect it because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a separate term from the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient would be 6 times whatever the coefficient is from the second part for each term. But no, I think I'm overcomplicating it. Let me clarify: The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expansions, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will multiply each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the coefficient from the first part, and the second part can have any terms involving \\(c\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Wait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, I think the question is asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. Hmm, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the 0 power, so that the term is just \\(a^2b^2\\). In that case, I would need to consider both parts. Let me try that approach. So, if I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power, then I need to find the product of the coefficients from each part that contribute to this term. So, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. From \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), I get \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which happens when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

    "text": " \n\nNow, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That also looks like a binomial expansion. So, applying the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Wait, that simplifies to \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m}\\), which is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nSo, putting it all together, the entire expression is the product of these two expansions. So, \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\(\\left(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\right) \\times \\left(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\right)\\). \n\nNow, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables in the first part, and \\(c\\) is in the second part. So, when I multiply these two expansions together, the terms will involve both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) from the first sum, and \\(c\\) terms from the second sum. \n\nBut the problem is asking only for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I guess I need to find the terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2 respectively. But wait, in the first part, each term is \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\), so to get \\(a^2b^2\\), I need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, that would correspond to \\(k = 2\\), right? Because \\(4 - 2 = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2\\). \n\nNow, that's just the first part. The second part is the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which, as I found earlier, is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nSo, when I multiply the two expansions together, each term in the first sum will multiply each term in the second sum. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first sum will multiply each term in the second sum. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second sum involves \\(c\\) terms, which don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) multiplied by the entire second sum, right? \n\nWait, no. Wait a minute, actually, that's not correct. Because when you multiply two sums, each term in the first sum is multiplied by each term in the second sum. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion and the entire second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which should be a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). \n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the problem. Let me check again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, in the expanded form, each term would be of the form \\(a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\) times the coefficients. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would correspond to the terms where \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\), and for the \\(c\\) terms, any \\(m\\) such that \\(6 - 2m\\) is whatever exponent of \\(c\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), does that mean I'm supposed to sum over all possible \\(m\\) for that specific \\(a^2b^2\\) term? \n\nWait, that might make sense. Because in the product, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will multiply each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, each multiplied by the coefficient from the first expansion. \n\nWait, let me think again. The first expansion gives a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) which has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. Then, the second expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when I multiply these together, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by 6. \n\nWait, but that can't be right because the second expansion's coefficients are already \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), so the total sum of coefficients in the second expansion is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, if I take 6 times 64, that would be 384. But wait, is that the correct approach? Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all terms in the other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every possible term in the second expansion, each time with a different power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) varies would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without considering \\(c\\), then perhaps it's considering all possible terms where the exponent of \\(a\\) is 2 and \\(b\\) is 2, regardless of \\(c\\)'s exponent. \n\nWait, but in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power, so that the entire term is \\(a^2b^2\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. \n\nLet me check that. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then that would be the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. So, that would involve taking the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion and the term where \\(c^0\\) comes from the second expansion. \n\nSo, let's see. From the first expansion, as I said, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). From the second expansion, the term where \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) where \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). So, solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient from the second expansion for \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). \n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), it just said \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, so maybe I was overcomplicating. Let me go back to the problem statement: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" \n\nSo, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), which gives us \\(k = 2\\). Then, the exponent of \\(c\\) would be \\(6 - 2m\\). So, the term would be \\(a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\), with the coefficient being \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible exponents of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But that would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). \n\nWait, but \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\), as I thought earlier. So, then the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nBut that seems high. Let me check again. If I consider that each term in the product is a combination of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion, then when I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent, I have to consider all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any \\(c\\) term. So, the coefficient would indeed be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to treat \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as separate variables and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be a specific term. But the problem didn't specify the \\(c\\) term, so I'm not sure. \n\nWait, perhaps I should look at it another way. The entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and one in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the product is a term from the first polynomial times a term from the second polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would be the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial. Because when you distribute, each term in the first polynomial's \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, contributing to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. \n\nWait, but that's not quite right. Because in the product, each term is a combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\)'s exponent, then yes, it would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial contributes a coefficient that gets multiplied by the first polynomial's term. \n\nSo, the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is indeed \\(2^6 = 64\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me confirm with a small example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it's \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the product would be 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) would be 1 times 2, so also 2. \n\nIf I compute the product, it's \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). So, the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are each 2, which is indeed 1 times 2. So, that seems to check out. \n\nSo, applying that logic to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is \\(2^6 = 64\\), so \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. The second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, its expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The sum of its coefficients is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), which is correct. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nBut wait, I just thought of another approach. Maybe I can treat the entire expression as a product and find the coefficient directly. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). But if I'm just looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient is the sum over all possible \\(k\\) of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). \n\nBut that's the same as what I did before, which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 times 64, giving 384. \n\nAlternatively, if I were to look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is \\(a^2b^2\\), that would require finding the term where \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which as I found earlier is when \\(m = 3\\), giving a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nSo, depending on whether the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) or specifically \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), the answer would be different. \n\nWait, but the problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the way it's phrased, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without mentioning \\(c\\). So, in algebraic expressions, when you have multiple variables, the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) would include all possible coefficients from the other variables. So, in this case, the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). \n\nSo, that would mean that the coefficient is indeed 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have two polynomials, say \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), then the product \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\) would have terms where each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the entire polynomial \\(Q(c)\\). So, when you look at the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), where \\(k = 6 - 2m\\). \n\nBut if you're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying \\(c\\), then you're effectively summing over all possible \\(k\\), so the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nSo, I think that's the correct answer. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had specified a specific power of \\(c\\), like \\(c^0\\), then the coefficient would be 120. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's 384. \n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion is \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 2 (from \\(ac\\) and \\(a/c\\)), which is the same as \\(\\dbinom{1}{1}\\) times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) is also 2. \n\nSo, if I apply that to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nTherefore, after going through this step-by-step, I think the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{384}\n\\]"

So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, times the entire second expansion, but since the second expansion is a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes a factor that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), just adds to the coefficient. But that seems off because the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficients are numbers. So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that's not correct because each term in the second expansion has a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for different \\(k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But actually, no, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion, but that would mean it's a polynomial, not a number. That can't be right. So, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but considering that \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are variables, so each term in the product would be of the form \\(a^kb^l c^m\\) or similar. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all terms in the product that have \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, but let me check that again because I might be making a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times each term in the second expansion, which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by other terms. But that can't be right because the entire expression is the product of the two expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me think differently. Maybe I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would involve terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. Let me verify this again.\n\nFirst, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the sum of the coefficients is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, when you multiply the two expansions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Thus, the final coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the term where the power of \\(a\\) is 2 and the power of \\(b\\) is 2 would be when \\(k = 2\\), right? Because \\(4 - k = 2\\) implies \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. So, the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\).\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider the product of these two expansions. But wait, the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part. So, does that mean that the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding something here.\n\nWait, actually, no. Because the entire expression is a product of two separate expansions. So, when you multiply them together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can ignore the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) because they don't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times whatever the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is, because each term in the second expansion would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. No, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients combine. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, and thus contribute to the coefficient. But wait, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's just a constant factor when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is another polynomial, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). And since the sum of coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which is 2^6 = 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me think differently. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering \\(c\\). But in that case, the \\(c\\) terms would just be part of the product, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a number. That doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\).\n\nWait, so maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. It says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which implies that \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are the only variables, and \\(c\\) is perhaps a constant or another variable, but in the expression, it's multiplied by the other part. Hmm, perhaps I need to clarify.\n\nWait, no, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, so it's possible that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient would then be a sum over all those terms. But that's more complicated. Let me try to clarify.\n\nWait, actually, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when you expand it, you'll have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems correct. Let me verify by considering a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\). Then, expanding, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1 = c + 1/c\\). So, the product is \\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be 1*(1 + 1) = 2, because \\(c + 1/c\\) evaluated at \\(c=1\\) is 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2*2=4, and the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) would be 1*2=2. So, in this case, the coefficients are multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of the other polynomial, which is 2. So, applying that logic, in the original problem, the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but the problem doesn't specify, so I think it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try another approach. Let me expand both parts separately and see.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\) expands to \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nNext, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands using the binomial theorem as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, the product would be \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is the product of two polynomials. So, when you multiply them, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can look at the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and multiply it by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for each \\(k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then we need to sum over all possible \\(k\\), meaning the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), then we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) because when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), \\(k=3\\). So, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6*20=120.\n\nWait, so now I'm confused because depending on how the problem is interpreted, the answer could be 384 or 120. Let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's asking for the coefficient when considering \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for both interpretations and see which one makes sense. Let me think: if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 384. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120. But since the problem mentions both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), but not \\(c\\), maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), so 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. In the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, for example, \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would appear in the product as \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for \\(k\\) from 0 to 6, each with their own coefficients. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all these coefficients, which is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, so 6*20=120.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so it's ambiguous. But I think the standard interpretation would be that the coefficient is taken with respect to all variables, meaning that \\(c\\) can be any power, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), so 120.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute both and see which one makes sense.\n\nWait, let's compute \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the terms are:\n\n- \\(k=0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0} c^6 = 1 * c^6\\)\n- \\(k=1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1} c^4 = 6c^4\\)\n- \\(k=2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2} c^2 = 15c^2\\)\n- \\(k=3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\\)\n- \\(k=4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4} c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(k=5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5} c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(k=6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6} c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the sum of all coefficients is when \\(c=1\\), which is \\(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64\\), as I thought earlier.\n\nSo, if I take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) which is 6, and multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6*1=6, \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 6*6=36, \\(a^2b^2c^2\\) is 6*15=90, \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6*20=120, and so on. Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it would be the sum of all these coefficients, which is 6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6. Let me add that up: 6 + 36 = 42; 42 + 90 = 132; 132 + 120 = 252; 252 + 90 = 342; 342 + 36 = 378; 378 + 6 = 384. So, that's 384.\n\nBut if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\), then it's 120. So, which one is it? The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without mentioning \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if that's the correct interpretation. In algebra, when you have multiple variables, the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) would include all possible coefficients from the other variables. So, for example, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from those terms. So, I think 384 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and when you expand it, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but that seems inconsistent with the problem statement. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but let me think of another way. Let's consider that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial contributes to the coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, in this case, the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, as we calculated earlier, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I'm not making a mistake. Let me take a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, as I did earlier, the product is \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0c^1\\) is 1, \\(a^2b^0c^{-1}\\) is 1, \\(a^1b^1c^1\\) is 2, \\(a^1b^1c^{-1}\\) is 2, \\(a^0b^2c^1\\) is 1, \\(a^0b^2c^{-1}\\) is 1. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's 1 + 1 = 2. Alternatively, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0c^0\\), it's zero because there's no \\(c^0\\) term in \\(a^2\\). But in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) is 2, which is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 2 (since \\(c + 1/c\\) evaluated at \\(c=1\\) is 2). So, that seems to check out.\n\nSimilarly, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " Now, I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means I need the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. So, in terms of the binomial coefficients, that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\) and \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). So, solving \\(4 - k = 2\\), we get \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient here is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to figure out how this part affects the coefficient. Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), right? Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is for the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, actually, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can think of it as the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of the constant term (i.e., the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a constant, you just get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set the exponent equal to zero: \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, let me double-check that reasoning. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only care about the term in the second expansion that's a constant (i.e., doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\)), which is 20. So, yes, the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think that makes sense. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as each part being independent. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the coefficients multiply when you take the product of the two expansions. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient for \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, so when you multiply them, you get 120. That seems consistent. \n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. Let me just recap: \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using binomial theorem, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using binomial theorem, find the constant term, which is 20.\n3. Multiply the two coefficients together to get 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYeah, that seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. This corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), giving us:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6 a^{2}b^{2}\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Solving \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient for this term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Now, I'm looking for the term where the exponent of \\(a\\) is 2 and the exponent of \\(b\\) is 2. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), so \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, their exponents won't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials together, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But in this case, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only comes from the first part, and the second part contributes a factor that is multiplied by it. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the second part could be any term, but actually, no, because the entire expression is the product of both expansions. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first part, and the second part is a separate polynomial, when we multiply them together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But when we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we're only considering the part that comes from \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and since the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents, the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is a sum, not a single term. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all the terms in the second part. But that can't be right because the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has terms involving different powers of \\(c\\), but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term in the second expansion would create a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2(1/c)^k\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, because each term in the second part is a separate term, so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2(1/c)^k\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but no, the problem specifically says \\(a^2b^2\\), so it's only considering the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 64, so 6*64=384. But let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Each term in the second part is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, you get \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum over all \\(k\\) from 0 to 6 of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) multiplied by the coefficient from the first part, which is 6. Wait, no, because the coefficient from the first part is 6, and for each term in the second part, you're multiplying by that coefficient. So, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But the sum of all coefficients in the second part is indeed when \\(c=1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, 6*64=384. So, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because sometimes, when you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, we're looking for a term that only comes from one part of the product, specifically the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part (which is 64). So, yes, 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so the exponent of \\(c\\) must be zero. Wait, that's another way to look at it. So, in the first part, we have \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and in the second part, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me calculate that. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k=3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6*20=120. Wait, now I'm getting a different answer. Hmm, so which one is correct? Earlier, I thought it was 384, but now I'm getting 120. I must have made a mistake in my initial approach.\n\nLet me clarify: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. In this case, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, in the first polynomial, we have \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and in the second polynomial, we have terms that involve various powers of \\(c\\). But since the term we're interested in doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need the part of the second polynomial that contributes \\(c^0\\), because any other power of \\(c\\) would make the term have \\(c\\) raised to some exponent, which we don't want. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, which is 20. So, 6*20=120.\n\nWait, so why did I get 384 earlier? Because I thought the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64. But that would be the case if we were looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), we need to consider only the part where \\(c^0\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20, and multiply it by 6, giving 120. So, the correct answer should be 120.\n\nLet me double-check this. Let's expand both parts:\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6.\n\nSecond, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) \u21d2 \\(k=3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, when we multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the term \\(20c^0\\) from the second part, giving \\(6 * 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, my initial mistake was thinking that the entire sum of coefficients in the second part (64) should be multiplied by 6, but that would give the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), which is not what the problem is asking. The problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so we need to consider only the term in the second part that doesn't involve \\(c\\), which is 20. Therefore, the correct coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is the problem asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), or is it asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\)? The problem says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so I think it's regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for a specific \\(k\\), then we would have to consider the corresponding term from the second part. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider all terms in the second part that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), result in \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). But since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), we need to sum over all possible \\(k\\), which would mean multiplying the coefficient from the first part by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, but that would be 6*64=384. But that contradicts the earlier reasoning where I thought it should be 120.\n\nI'm getting confused here. Let me try to clarify:\n\n- If the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for a specific \\(k\\), then we would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second part. That would give us the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) in the entire product.\n\n- However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any power of \\(c\\). This is ambiguous. Does it mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), or does it mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) (i.e., \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) term)?\n\nIf it's the former, meaning the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. If it's the latter, meaning the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 multiplied by 20, giving 120.\n\nLooking back at the problem statement: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" The way it's phrased, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, I think it's the latter case, where we're looking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), so the coefficient is 120.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider both interpretations:\n\n1. Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\): This would mean that any term in the product that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) would contribute to this coefficient. So, the coefficient would be the sum over all \\(k\\) of (coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in first part) times (coefficient of \\(c^{k}\\) in second part). But since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64, the total coefficient would be 6*64=384.\n\n2. Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\): This would mean we're only considering the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. In this case, the coefficient is 6*20=120.\n\nGiven the problem statement, I think it's more likely that they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Therefore, the answer should be 120.\n\nBut to make sure, let me check online or recall if there's a standard interpretation. Typically, when asked for the coefficient of a term in a product of polynomials, unless specified otherwise, it's looking for the coefficient of that exact term, considering all variables. So, if the term is \\(a^2b^2\\), it's looking for the coefficient when \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the term would involve \\(c\\) as well. So, I think the correct answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I expand the entire expression: \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). Now, when I multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the terms would be \\(6a^2b^2c^6 + 6*6a^2b^2c^4 + 6*15a^2b^2c^2 + 6*20a^2b^2 + 6*15a^2b^2/c^2 + 6*6a^2b^2/c^4 + 6*1a^2b^2/c^6\\). So, in this expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6*20=120, because that's the term where \\(c^0\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), so they don't contribute to the coefficient of just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the correct coefficient is 120.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20.\n\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider the entire product. But wait, the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, no, actually, in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe we just need to consider the coefficient from the first part, and the second part's expansion doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term's coefficient because each term in the second part is multiplied by it. Wait, no, actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and then I multiply it by, say, \\(c^6\\) from the second part, that would give me \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that can't be right because in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only appear if the second part contributes a term that's 1, but the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which expands to terms involving various powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but none of these would be just \\(a^2b^2\\) unless the second part contributes a constant term. Wait, does \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) have a constant term? Let me check that. The general term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). For the term to be constant, the exponent must be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by the constant term 20 from the second part, I get \\(20a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 20 times the coefficient from the first part, which was 6. Wait, no, actually, no. Wait, the coefficient from the first part is 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and then when you multiply by the constant term 20 from the second part, the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. But wait, let me think again. When you expand \\((a + b)^4\\), you have terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), \\(b^4\\). Then, when you multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the second expansion is a multiple of some power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get terms like \\(6 \\times \\text{coefficient} \\times a^2b^2c^k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) term. Wait, but that's not possible because each term would have some power of \\(c\\). Unless the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that we're looking for all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), whose sum of coefficients can be found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems high. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms, which would include terms with different powers of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384, as above. But that seems a bit counterintuitive. Alternatively, perhaps the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that we're looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, i.e., the constant term. In that case, as I found earlier, the constant term in the second expansion is 20, so the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. So, which is it? Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's the coefficient when you consider all possible terms, but that would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. However, that seems a bit odd because usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term, it's in the entire expression, which would include all possible combinations of variables. But in this case, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would appear in the product multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which is a power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of the products of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial with each term in the second polynomial. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first polynomial, and the second polynomial has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that we're considering the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, each multiplied by their respective coefficients from the second polynomial. So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms, which would include different powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second polynomial, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1 = (a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The expansion would be \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) in this product is \\(c + 1/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) is not just 1, but it's actually a polynomial in \\(c\\). Similarly, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), specifically 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's actually a polynomial, but the problem seems to be asking for a numerical coefficient, which suggests that maybe it's considering the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power, i.e., the constant term. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that it's 6 times the entire expansion, but that would result in a polynomial, not a single number. Therefore, I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire product, but only for the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero. So, that would be 6 * 20 = 120. Let me confirm that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and to get a term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present without any \\(c\\) terms, we need to multiply it by the constant term from the second part, which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

    "text": " That means the coefficients for each term can be found using the binomial coefficients. So, for example, the term when \\(k = 0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 = 1 \\cdot a^4 \\cdot 1 = a^4\\). When \\(k = 1\\), it's \\(\\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 = 4a^3b\\), and so on. Now, I'm specifically looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the term where the exponent of \\(a\\) is 2 and the exponent of \\(b\\) is 2. That would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) in the binomial expansion because \\(a^{4 - 2}b^2 = a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient here is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is equal to \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is asking only for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the other terms involving \\(c\\), right? Because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the only thing that matters is that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some coefficient from the second expansion. But actually, wait, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because that would give me a term like \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{something}\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), not \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, so the entire expression is a product of two expansions, one in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in terms of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, but all the terms in the second expansion involve \\(c\\). So, unless there's a term in the second expansion that is \\(c^0\\), which is just a constant, then that term would multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) and contribute to the coefficient. Because if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) times a constant, that would give me a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with that constant as its coefficient. So, I think that's the key here. I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because that term is just a constant and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) gives a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and that constant as the coefficient. So, first, let me find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\). To do that, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(c\\) equal to \\(6 - 2m\\). I need to find the value of \\(m\\) such that \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), because that's the term with \\(c^0\\). So, solving for \\(m\\): \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) \u2192 \\(2m = 6\\) \u2192 \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the constant term. The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by 20, giving \\(20a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 20 times the coefficient from the first expansion. Wait, no, actually, no. Wait, in the first expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Then, when we multiply by the second expansion, which includes the constant term 20, that would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, giving a term \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2 = 120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me make sure. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. However, the only term in the second expansion that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is the constant term, which is 20. All other terms involve positive or negative powers of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by those terms, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-1}\\), etc., which are not \\(a^2b^2\\) terms. Only when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term 20 do you get a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 20. But wait, in the first expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, so when you multiply that by 20, you get 6 * 20 = 120 as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 120. Let me double-check that. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a, b\\) and the other in \\(c\\). So, when I multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is simply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial that don't involve \\(c\\). But in this case, the second polynomial only has a constant term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), which is 20. So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. I think that's correct. Let me see if there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, since the two expansions are independent, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression would be the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion and \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. Since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), but wait, no. Actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), so in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion by the \\(c^0\\) term in the second expansion. All other terms would have some power of \\(c\\), so they wouldn't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term without \\(c\\). So, that's another way to see that the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. So, yeah, I think 120 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Now, since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I should find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each. That means \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), so \\(k = 2\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). Calculating the binomial coefficient, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\).

So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient. Wait, but actually, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). So, when I multiply the two expansions together, the terms will be products of terms from each expansion. But I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I need to see how that term interacts with the other expansion. \n\nLet me think. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), I guess that means I just need to multiply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second part has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which aren't present in the first part. So, actually, each term in the product will be a combination of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what happens with \\(c\\), that means I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and then multiply it by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because when you multiply by the entire second expansion, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because in the product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's actually just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire sum of coefficients in the second part. But that seems too simplistic. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try a different approach.\n\nWait, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the product is a sum of terms where each term is a product of a term from the first polynomial and a term from the second. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of those involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. Wait, I'm confused now.\n\nLet me clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means, in the entire product, I'm looking for all terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, each such term would be of the form \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) something involving \\(c\\). But since the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misinterpreting the question. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would involve both expansions. Hmm, but the problem just says \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think it's just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the other expansion. \n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem, and it's actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0, respectively. That would make more sense because then the term would be \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), and I need to find its coefficient in the product.\n\nLet me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, it just says \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. As I thought before, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but maybe I'm wrong. Let me think again. If I have two polynomials, P(a, b) = (a + b)^4 and Q(c) = (c + 1/c)^6. Then, their product is P(a, b) * Q(c). So, when you multiply them, each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in P is multiplied by each term in Q, which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), ..., \\(c^{-6}\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) comes from \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) comes from \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^4\\), and so on, down to \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for all k, which is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P times the sum of coefficients in Q. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, is that correct? Because in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from Q. So, yes, that would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in Q, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be different. Let me check that approach too, just to be thorough. \n\nIf I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that would mean I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\) from the second expansion. So, in that case, I would first find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply those two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). \n\nSo, let's compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which means \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then the answer would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nBut wait, the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, which interpretation is correct? I think it's more likely that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. However, I'm not entirely sure because sometimes in such problems, they might be asking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0, respectively. \n\nLet me try to see which approach makes sense. If I consider the problem as asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then the answer is 120. If I consider it as asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 384. \n\nBut looking back at the problem statement: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 120. Since the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 384. \n\nBut wait, another way to think about it is that in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), ..., \\(c^{-6}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for all k, which is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second part. \n\nSo, the sum of coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut I'm still a bit unsure because sometimes when you have multiple variables, the coefficient might refer to the term with specific exponents for all variables. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's a bit ambiguous. However, given the problem statement, I think the intended interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the answer is 384. \n\nWait, but let me double-check by considering a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Expanding this, we get \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product would be 0 because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, that's not helpful. Alternatively, if I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first part times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 1 * 2 = 2. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product is 2. Similarly, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for that. Let me see. If I'm looking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that would mean I'm looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nBut how do I know which one the problem is asking for? The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so without any mention of \\(c\\), it's ambiguous. However, in problems like this, often when you have multiple variables, they might be asking for the term where all variables have specific exponents. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's possible that the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written in a way that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and they're asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). But that seems odd because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you're introducing terms with \\(c\\). So, the only way to have a term without \\(c\\) is if you multiply by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. \n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product can only come from \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the constant term in the second part. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any other term from the second part, you'll get a term involving \\(c\\), which would make it \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some k. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\), then it must be the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) and the constant term in the second expansion. \n\nSo, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20, giving 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nTherefore, I think I was wrong earlier. The problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), so the coefficient is 120. \n\nTo confirm, let's think about it again. If I have two polynomials multiplied together, the terms in the product are combinations of terms from each polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product comes only from \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the term with \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial. All other terms would have some power of \\(c\\), so they wouldn't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nYes, that makes sense now. I think I confused myself earlier by considering the sum of all coefficients, but actually, since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\), it must be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. \n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6.\n2. Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20.\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together to get 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the product of the coefficients from each part of the expression. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\). Using the binomial theorem, this is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiply the two coefficients: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " \n\nNow, I'm specifically looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, let me compute that term. The coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), right? Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by another expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient I found. Let me think about this. Since the two expressions are multiplied together, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait a second, I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second expression, which involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. However, when we multiply terms, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't get affected by the second expression because it's in terms of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second, but in this case, since the second polynomial only involves \\(c\\), the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) remain the same as in the first part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, no, that's not correct either. Because when you multiply by the second expression, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, the second part can contribute any term, but the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't change. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like it would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part isn't a constant. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. So, each term in the second part will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nBut wait, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is just one term, so when we multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, it's like \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and we're to find the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the exponents on \\(c\\). \n\nIn that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like the coefficient would be a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps I'm missing something. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is the product of the coefficients from each part. Let me think again. \n\nLet me break it down. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nSo, if we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), that means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, for \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, the term will be multiplied by each term from the second part, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), because each term from the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. Because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually just the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But that's not correct because the second part isn't a constant; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). \n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the variables. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part. But that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a single number. \n\nHmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, we'd need to find the term where, in addition to \\(a^2b^2\\), the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. \n\nLet me check that. So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we need to find the coefficient where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would mean, in the second part, we need the term where \\(c^{6 - 2m} = c^0\\), so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). \n\nSo, in the second part, the coefficient when \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the term from the second part is \\(20c^0 = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but the original problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\); it just said \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the exponents on \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient isn't a single number but a polynomial. \n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the coefficient in the first part, but that seems unlikely because it's multiplied by the second part. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and when multiplied by the entire second part, each term in the second part will contribute to the coefficient. But since we're only asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that's not a single number. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120, as I calculated earlier. Because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense as an answer. So, maybe the problem assumes that we're looking for the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that can't be right because the answer should be a single number. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me try a different approach. Let's consider the entire product. Each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - m} \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^m}\\), which simplifies to \\(a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). \n\nWe are looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). If we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that's not a single number. \n\nWait, but maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nBut that seems high. Let me check that. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64. Then, multiplying by 6, we get 384. But that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384, which seems possible. \n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120, as I calculated earlier. \n\nWait, let me think again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's not specifying anything about \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, which is in terms of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that's a polynomial, not a single number. \n\nWait, but perhaps the problem is considering the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the exponents on \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. \n\nWait, maybe I should check the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's only specifying \\(a^2b^2\\), not involving \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would be a polynomial, but that's not a single number. \n\nHmm, this is confusing. Maybe I should think of it differently. Let me consider that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second polynomial. \n\nBut that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense as an answer. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120, as calculated earlier. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms, regardless of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nWait, let me think about it numerically. Suppose I set \\(c = 1\\). Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the product becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this case would be 6 \\times 64 = 384. \n\nBut if I set \\(c = 1\\), I'm essentially evaluating the expression at \\(c = 1\\), which gives me a polynomial in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) where all the \\(c\\) terms are combined. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this case is 384. \n\nAlternatively, if I don't set \\(c = 1\\), the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem didn't specify, so perhaps the intended answer is 384. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought the answer might be 120, which is the coefficient when \\(c^0\\) is considered. So, which is it? \n\nLet me try another approach. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the terms where \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for each \\(m\\) from 0 to 6, we have a term in the second part, \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\right)\\). So, the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is \\(6c^6 + 36c^4 + 90c^2 + 120 + 90c^{-2} + 36c^{-4} + 6c^{-6}\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in this context would mean the entire polynomial. However, that doesn't make sense because the answer should be a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is 120. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and not considering the second part. But that seems unlikely because the second part is part of the product. \n\nWait, perhaps I should check the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is the product of the coefficients from each part. \n\nBut in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible exponents of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense as an answer. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is mistyped, and it's supposed to be \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but as written, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating, and the answer is simply 6, the coefficient from the first part, and the second part is irrelevant because we're only looking at \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). But that seems incorrect because the entire product is considered. \n\nWait, no, because the entire product includes the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that's a polynomial, not a single number. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible exponents of \\(c\\), which would mean the coefficient is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a number. So, perhaps the intended answer is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. \n\nWait, I think I need to clarify. Let me consider that when you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one variable is the product of the coefficients from each polynomial. But in this case, the first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second polynomial. \n\nBut that's not a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense as an answer. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But that doesn't seem right because the entire product is considered. \n\nWait, no, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the second polynomial, each term in the second polynomial is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. \n\nBut the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible exponents of \\(c\\), which would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, but that doesn't make sense as an answer. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\) raised to different powers. \n\nWhen we multiply the two expressions together, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which are \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But the sum of all coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, that makes sense because when you set \\(c = 1\\), you're essentially summing all the coefficients of the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384. \n\nBut earlier, I thought it might be 120, which is the coefficient when \\(c^0\\) is considered. So, which one is correct? \n\nWait, let me think again. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then the coefficient is indeed 384 because each term in the second part contributes to the coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. \n\nBut the problem as stated is: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's only specifying \\(a^2b^2\\), not involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nWait, but let me confirm this by considering an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 2 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is \\(c + 1/c\\). The sum of coefficients is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), so 2 times 2 is 4. But looking at the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't exist because the first part only goes up to \\(a^2b^0\\) and \\(b^2a^0\\). Wait, that's a bad example. \n\nWait, let me take a better example. Let's say \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion is \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) in this product would be the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first part, which is 1, multiplied by the entire second part, which is \\(c + 1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\). \n\nBut if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a\\), it's a polynomial, not a number. So, in that case, the answer would be \\(c + 1/c\\). Similarly, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is mistyped, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c)^4\\) or something else. But as written, I think the intended answer is 120, considering the term where \\(c^0\\) is involved. \n\nWait, let me think again. If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial. But if the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, then perhaps it's 120, the coefficient when \\(c^0\\) is considered. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which is a polynomial, so the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that's not a single number. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible exponents of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a number, so perhaps it's 120. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant. But that seems unlikely because the product is given. \n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). \n\nWhen you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in one variable is the product of the coefficients from each polynomial. But in this case, since the second polynomial is in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second polynomial. \n\nBut that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense as an answer. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible exponents of \\(c\\), which would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, but that's not a number. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant. But that doesn't make sense because the entire product is given. \n\nWait, no, because the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire product, so the second part must be considered. \n\nI think I'm going in circles here. Let me try to summarize: \n\n- The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. \n- The second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which expands to a polynomial in \\(c\\). \n- When multiplied together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. \n- If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient is a polynomial, which isn't a single number. \n- If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. \n- If the problem is asking for the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all \\(c\\) terms, then it's 384. \n\nGiven that the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a number, I think the intended answer is 120, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). \n\nSo, to confirm, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is calculated as follows: \n\n1. In the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). \n2. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient here is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n3. Multiply these coefficients together: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. \n\nI think that's the answer the problem is looking for.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\) in the second part. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the term where \\(c^0\\) occurs, which has a coefficient of 20.\n3. Multiply these coefficients: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Now, I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, right? So that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me check that: if \\(k = 2\\), then the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). Calculating the binomial coefficient, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, I'm not sure yet. Let me think. Since the expression is a product of two binomials, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by all the terms in the second part. But when we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we only care about the part that comes from the first factor, right? Because the second factor is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because when you multiply the two expansions, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is just a single term, and when multiplied by the entire second expansion, it becomes \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the entire second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Wait, no, actually, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are separate from the \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms. So, when you multiply them together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression in terms of \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that comes from the first factor, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second factor, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), it only affects the powers of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply the two expansions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. However, when we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we're considering the entire expression, which includes all possible terms with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). But the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion, but that's not a numerical coefficient. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all terms, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, their coefficients are independent of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, because the second factor doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that seems too simple. Let me check. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by something else, say \\(X\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(X\\). So, if \\(X\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times \\(X\\), but that would still be an expression in terms of \\(c\\), not a number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not. It's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second factor, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not a number. So, maybe I'm misinterpreting the question. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expansion, treating all variables together. But that doesn't make sense because \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate variables. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire second factor. But that's not a numerical value. Therefore, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. The product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be written as the sum over all terms of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the \\(c\\) terms, that's \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} \\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\). Now, for each \\(k = 2\\), we have terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent, the coefficient would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). So, that's 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\). But the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, does that make sense? Let me check. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and when you multiply by the entire second expansion, which has 64 terms in total (since each term in the second expansion is multiplied by the 6), but actually, no, the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which has 7 terms, each with coefficients \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.

Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply. But since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product will just be the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and the entire second part.

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all the terms in the second part. But wait, that can't be right because that would make the coefficient 6 times the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a large number, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a single term in the product. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way for \\(c\\) terms to affect the coefficient is if they multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by a constant.

But that can't be right because the second expansion isn't a single term. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). In other words, when you multiply the two expansions, you'll have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients of the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is the same as the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), because each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is 6, and when multiplied by each term in the second part, which has coefficients, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. But the sum of all coefficients in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too high. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would depend on the power of \\(c\\), and the problem didn't specify any power for \\(c\\). So, if that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. That would mean I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply them together. That makes more sense. So, let me proceed with that approach. First, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do that, I can expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, since the two parts are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. Wait, but let me double-check that. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), which is the sum of all coefficients. So, if I just wanted the sum of all coefficients in the second part, it would be 64, but since I'm looking for the specific coefficient where \\(c^0\\), it's 20. So, yes, multiplying 6 by 20 gives 120. Alternatively, if I didn't consider the \\(c^0\\) part and just multiplied 6 by 64, I would get 384, which is incorrect because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not the sum of all coefficients multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Let me confirm this by considering the entire expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) as 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as 20. When you multiply these together, you get 6 * 20 = 120, so the coefficient is 120. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) separately. \n\n1. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiplying these coefficients gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " So, the terms would be when k=0: \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 = 1 \\cdot a^4\\), k=1: \\(\\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 = 4a^3b\\), k=2: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\), k=3: \\(\\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 = 4ab^3\\), and k=4: \\(\\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4 = 1 \\cdot b^4\\). So, that's the expansion of the first part. \n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I think I can also expand this using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Let me simplify that. The term \\(\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\) is the same as \\(c^{-m}\\), so each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) for m from 0 to 6.\n\nNow, the original expression is the product of these two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think I need to consider how the terms from each expansion multiply together. But wait, actually, in the product, each term from the first expansion will multiply each term from the second expansion. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to see which terms in the first expansion contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) and then, since the second expansion involves \\(c\\) terms, which don't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion. Wait, that doesn't seem right because the second expansion is multiplied by each term in the first. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). So, when I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term will come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which doesn't make sense because when you multiply two expressions, each term in one is multiplied by each term in the other, and the coefficients add up accordingly.\n\nWait, maybe I'm wrong. Let me clarify. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and since the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those terms contributes their own coefficients, so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, that seems plausible. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be (coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by (sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). Let me check that logic.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, and \\(c\\) terms are separate, the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all terms from the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those terms will have a coefficient, and since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the total coefficient would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but how do I find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? The sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), right? Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) into the expression will give the sum of all coefficients. So, let me compute that. \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) times 64 (sum of coefficients in the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to that specific term. In this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second polynomial only involves \\(c\\), each term in the second polynomial is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient would be 6 (the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)) times each term's coefficient in the second expansion, summed over all possible terms. But since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if I can think of it another way. Suppose I consider the entire product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as if I took the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiplied it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient, not the entire term, the coefficient would be 6 times each term in the second expansion, but since each term has a coefficient, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Alternatively, if I didn't consider this, and tried to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), that would be different, but since the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nLet me double-check by computing the sum of coefficients in the second expansion. The expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), which is correct. So, the sum is indeed 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I'm not missing anything. Let me think about the structure of the expansion. When I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6a^2b^2. Then, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion will be multiplied by 6a^2b^2, resulting in terms like 6a^2b^2c^6, 6a^2b^2c^4, etc. But since the problem is asking only for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), all those terms will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). So, if we are considering the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times each coefficient from the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by 6a^2b^2, contributes 6 times that coefficient to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). But since we're considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, the total contribution to \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I considered the product as two separate polynomials, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire second polynomial, but since we're only interested in the coefficient, not the variables, it's 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. That makes sense because when you multiply each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from the first polynomial times each coefficient from the second polynomial, summed over all terms. But since the second polynomial's terms don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), all those terms will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me take a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the first part is \\(\\dbinom{2}{0} = 1\\), and the sum of coefficients in the second part is \\(2^1 = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Let's expand it: \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). \\((c + 1) = c + 1\\). So, the product is \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1)\\) = \\(a^2c + a^2 + 2abc + 2ab + b^2c + b^2\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 1 (from \\(a^2c\\)) + 1 (from \\(a^2\\)) = 2, which matches 1 * 2 = 2. So, that works.\n\nSimilarly, if I take \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 2, so the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the product is 1 * 2 = 2. Expanding: \\((a + b)(c + 1)\\) = \\(ac + a + bc + b\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 (from \\(ac\\)) + 1 (from \\(a\\)) = 2. So, that works too.\n\nTherefore, applying this logic to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Let me compute the entire product and see. But that might be time-consuming, but perhaps I can compute the necessary parts. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient in the first part multiplied by the entire second part, so 6 * \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient, not the variables, it's 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the product being \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by every possible term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the total coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, 6 times 64 is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the answer should be 384.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me compute the sum of coefficients in the second expansion again. The expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me think about the expansion again. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), gives \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), expands to terms like \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\), right? Wait, no, actually, the coefficients are different. Let me compute the expansion properly.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\nThe expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, the terms are:\n\n- \\(m=0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^{6} = 1 \\cdot c^6\\)\n- \\(m=1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^{4} = 6c^4\\)\n- \\(m=2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^{2} = 15c^2\\)\n- \\(m=3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\)\n- \\(m=4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(m=5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(m=6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\).\n\nSo, the sum of coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64\\), which matches what I found earlier.\n\nTherefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by this expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by each coefficient in the second expansion, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), each term in the second expansion will just contribute its coefficient to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the total coefficient is 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think about it another way: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term is the sum of the products of coefficients from each polynomial whose variables multiply to give that term. In this case, since the first polynomial has terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second has terms in \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiplying it by every term from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 (from the first polynomial) multiplied by each coefficient from the second polynomial, summed together. But since each term in the second polynomial contributes its own coefficient, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the answer should be 384.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me compute it another way. Let's think of the entire product as:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\left(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\right) \\times \\left(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\right)\n\\]\n\nWhen we multiply these together, each term in the first sum is multiplied by each term in the second sum. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\) where \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), right? Because we need \\(a^2b^2\\), so \\(4 - k = 2\\) implies \\(k = 2\\). So, for each \\(m\\), the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), and then we sum over all \\(m\\) from 0 to 6. But \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), so the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\). The sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m=0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\), so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that's consistent with what I found earlier. So, I think 384 is the correct coefficient.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making any miscalculations. So, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), correct. The sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m=0\\) to \\(6\\) is indeed \\(2^6 = 64\\), correct. So, 6 * 64 = 384, which is 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of the problem as finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it's equivalent to finding the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nSo, after all this thinking and checking, I believe the coefficient is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nThe sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n\\[\n\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\\[\n6 \\times 64 = 384\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " Now, I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each. That would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) because \\(4 - k = 2\\) implies \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, I'm only asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is part of the first factor. Since the second factor is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which involves \\(c\\) terms, and the first factor is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply the two expressions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will multiply each term in the expansion of the second part. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think that the coefficient remains the same as in the first part because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. Wait, no, actually, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. Wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But actually, when you multiply two expressions together, the terms from each expression combine. So, for example, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient of any term in the second expansion, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Wait, but that can't be right because the problem is asking for a single coefficient. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, and \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just the coefficient from the first part, because when you multiply by the second part, which is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), each term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by something involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the same as in the first part, because the second part's terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. Wait, but that seems off. Let me think again. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). And \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded similarly, but I don't need to expand it because the problem is only about the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, for example, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and when I multiply it by each term in the second expansion, I'll get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., depending on the expansion of the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because each term would have a different power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that seems a bit strange because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply by the second part, you get terms that include \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second expansion multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient for each term would be the product of the coefficients from both parts. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would be the sum of all possible coefficients from the second part multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me clarify. If I have two polynomials multiplied together, say \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\), then each term in \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\), which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), etc., depending on the expansion. So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) would have a coefficient of 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times 1 (from \\(c^6\\)), so 6. Similarly, \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) would have a coefficient of 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^4\\) in \\(Q\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{1} = 6\\), so 6*6=36. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but since it's not specified, maybe it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). But that would mean adding up all the coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the total coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. The sum of all coefficients in the second part is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that appears in the first part, and when multiplied by each term in the second part, each of those products will have the same \\(a^2b^2\\) term but with different \\(c\\) exponents. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is a sum, not a single term. Wait, no, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the same as in the first part, because the second part is multiplied by each term, but the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is just 6 times the entire second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems plausible. But let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. Because in the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) sum to zero would be the constant term. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). That would make more sense, because otherwise, if it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6*64=384. But if it's asking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. Let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any \\(c\\) terms, so perhaps it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). So, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be a more typical problem. Let me see. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out would be when the exponent is 0. So, the general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I'm a bit confused. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It just says \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps it's considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to have \\(a^2b^2\\) as a standalone term, meaning that the \\(c\\) terms must also be considered. Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when multiplied by the second expansion, it's like \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps it's just 6, but that seems too simple. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. I'm a bit torn here. Let me see if I can find a way to clarify. If the problem had said \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)\", then it would be 120. But as it is, it's just \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". In the context of the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be the sum of all possible coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, that would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384. But I'm not entirely sure if that's what the problem is asking for. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. Since the problem didn't specify, I think it's more likely that it's asking for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be 384. But to be thorough, let me check both interpretations. First, if it's asking for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Second, if it's asking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. Given that the problem didn't specify the \\(c\\) terms, I think the first interpretation is correct, so the answer is 384. Wait, but that seems too large. Let me think again. Maybe I'm making a mistake here. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire second polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and when you multiply by the second polynomial, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the second polynomial is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\), and the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is intended to have \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems more reasonable. I think I might have overcomplicated it earlier. So, to summarize, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   We need to find the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out (i.e., \\(c^0\\)).

    "text": " \n\nWait, but I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would correspond to when \\(k = 2\\), because the exponent on \\(b\\) is \\(k\\). So, substituting \\(k = 2\\), the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the expansion of the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), is being multiplied by it. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, I might need to consider how the second part affects it. \n\nWait, but actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), it's going to affect the terms that involve \\(c\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), its coefficient in the product will be the same as in the first part, because the second part's expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6? \n\nWait, maybe I'm oversimplifying. Let me check again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, it's considering all possible terms. However, \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply it by terms from the second expansion, which involve \\(c\\), the resulting terms will have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something like that. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself (without any \\(c\\) terms) would only come from the case where the second part contributes a term that is \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term. \n\nSo, maybe I was wrong earlier. I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part. That way, the entire coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) (times the constant term) would be the product of the two coefficients. Let me see if that makes sense. \n\nSo, let's first find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nWe want the term where the exponent on \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the constant term in the second part is 20. Therefore, when we multiply the two expansions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (which is 6) multiplied by the constant term (which is 20) gives us the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Is that correct? Because when you multiply the two expansions, every term in the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. However, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself isn't just a single term; it's part of multiple terms in the product, each with different powers of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but actually, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then maybe I was wrong earlier. Alternatively, perhaps the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term independent of \\(c\\), so it would only appear once, multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion. \n\nWait, no, actually, in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would only be multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion, because any other term from the second expansion would involve a power of \\(c\\), which would make the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), not just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed the product of the coefficients from each part, specifically 6 (from the first expansion) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second expansion), giving 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), because \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, that would mean the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try another approach. Let me consider the entire expression as two separate parts: the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When I multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. \n\nSo, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion has a coefficient of 6, as we found earlier. Now, when we multiply this term by each term in the second expansion, we get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), ..., down to \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only be the case when the power of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), giving 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me think of a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, the first part is \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and the second part is \\(c + 1/c\\). Multiplying these together, the term \\(2ab\\) would be multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), giving \\(2ab c\\) and \\(2ab/c\\). But the coefficient of \\(ab\\) in the entire product would only be the coefficient when multiplied by the constant term, which in this case is zero because the second part doesn't have a constant term. Wait, but in our original problem, the second part does have a constant term. \n\nWait, in the example I just thought of, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\) doesn't have a constant term because when m=0, it's \\(c^1\\), and when m=1, it's \\(1/c^1\\). There's no term where the exponent is zero. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) in the product would be zero because there's no constant term to multiply by. \n\nBut in our problem, the second part does have a constant term, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me try another example to confirm. Let's take \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). The first part is \\(a + b\\), and the second part is \\(c^2 + 2c*(1/c) + (1/c)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). Now, if I multiply these together, the term \\(a\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second part, giving \\(a c^2 + 2a + a/c^2\\). Similarly, the term \\(b\\) would be multiplied by each term, giving \\(b c^2 + 2b + b/c^2\\). \n\nNow, if I look for the coefficient of \\(a\\), it's 1 from the first part, and in the second part, the constant term is 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would be 1 * 2 = 2. \n\nWait, but in this case, the term \\(a\\) in the first part is multiplied by the constant term 2 in the second part, giving 2a. Similarly for \\(b\\). So, that seems correct. So, applying the same logic, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not confusing the terms. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way it can appear in the product is when it's multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion. So, yes, that would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the product of the two expansions being equal to the product of each term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each part where the exponents add up to the desired term. \n\nWait, but in this case, since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think that's not the case. Wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so in the product, it would only be multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient would indeed be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I expand the entire product. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each of these, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), that would be different, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), it's the same as \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), so the coefficient is 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. Let me try to compute the entire product up to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. \n\nSo, the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), when expanded, gives terms up to \\(a^4\\) and \\(b^4\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, gives terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\). \n\nWhen I multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) would be 6 * 1 (since the coefficient of \\(c^6\\) in the second part is 1, from \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}\\)), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) would be 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}\\) = 6 * 6 = 36, and so on, until the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) = 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nSo, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 120. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's also 120. So, either way, the answer is 120. \n\nWait, but let me check if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which includes all possible powers of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 120, as calculated. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), which would mean that it's part of the expansion, but I think that's not the case because the entire expression includes both \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only appear once in the product, multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion, giving 120. \n\nWait, but to make sure, let me consider another approach. Let me treat the entire expression as a product of two polynomials and think about how the terms combine. \n\nSo, the first polynomial is \\((a + b)^4\\), which has terms \\(a^4, a^3b, a^2b^2, ab^3, b^4\\), each with their respective coefficients. The second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has terms \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, 1, c^{-2}, c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\), each with their respective coefficients. \n\nWhen you multiply these two polynomials together, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. The only term that would result in \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is when it's multiplied by the constant term \\(1\\) from the second polynomial. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the coefficient of \\(1\\) in the second polynomial. As we calculated earlier, that's 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute the entire product for a smaller exponent to see if this logic holds. Let's take \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). \n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). Then, expand \\((c + 1/c)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). Now, multiply these together:\n\n- \\(a^2 \\times c^2 = a^2c^2\\)\n- \\(a^2 \\times 2 = 2a^2\\)\n- \\(a^2 \\times 1/c^2 = a^2/c^2\\)\n- \\(2ab \\times c^2 = 2ab c^2\\)\n- \\(2ab \\times 2 = 4ab\\)\n- \\(2ab \\times 1/c^2 = 4ab / c^2\\)\n- \\(b^2 \\times c^2 = b^2c^2\\)\n- \\(b^2 \\times 2 = 2b^2\\)\n- \\(b^2 \\times 1/c^2 = b^2/c^2\\)\n\nNow, if I look for the coefficient of \\(ab\\), which is 4, it comes from \\(2ab \\times 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) in the product is 4, which is the product of the coefficients from each part: 2 (from \\(2ab\\)) and 2 (from the constant term in the second expansion). \n\nSimilarly, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in the second part), giving 120. \n\nTherefore, I think my initial conclusion was correct. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. \n\nWait, but let me just think once more. Suppose I didn't consider the second part's constant term. Then, I would have thought the coefficient is just 6, but that's not correct because the entire expression is a product, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present when multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion. So, the correct coefficient is indeed 120. \n\nSo, after all this thinking, I believe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives the overall coefficient as \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Now, I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. So, in the expansion, when \\(k = 2\\), because \\(4 - k = 2\\) implies \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), right? Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, does that mean I don't need to consider the second part? Or does it mean that I have to multiply by something from the second part? Let me think. The problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and when I multiply by the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it's a product of two expressions. But wait, \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so maybe when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by something from the second part, it would involve \\(c\\) terms, but since the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the coefficient is just 6, and the rest is about other terms. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product, so each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But I'm only interested in the term where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other variables (c and 1/c) can be anything, but since they are separate, maybe the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, regardless of the second part? Wait, that seems confusing. Let me think again. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Since \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is another factor, when you multiply the two expansions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But that doesn't seem right because the second expansion has terms with different powers of c, so unless we're considering the constant term, but the problem isn't asking for a constant term. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms. So, in other words, when you multiply out the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by various powers of c, but the coefficient for each of those terms (like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\)) would be 6 times the coefficients from the second expansion. But if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms, then perhaps it's simply 6, because in the product, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second, so \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that can't be right because the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is when c=1, so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) be 6 * 64 = 384? But that seems too large. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, so that the coefficient remains 6. Hmm, I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let me consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in the product would be \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\), where k ranges from 0 to 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when c=1, which is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c, which would mean that the coefficient is 6, because the other factor doesn't affect the a and b terms. Hmm, but that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 * coefficient from the second expansion for c^k. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms, then perhaps it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating c terms as separate variables, so the coefficient is just 6, and the c terms are separate. Hmm, I'm not sure. Let me check the problem again: it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so perhaps it's considering the coefficient in the entire expression, regardless of the c terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe it's just 6, because the c terms are separate and don't affect the a and b coefficients. I'm confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about it differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each of these terms would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms. So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributing to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times c^something. But if we're just considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms, then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of coefficients in the second expansion is when c=1, so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the other factor is just part of the expression, but since we're only asked about \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just 6. But that seems too simplistic, and I think the problem is expecting me to consider the entire product, so I think the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me verify that. Let's consider a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding this, we get:\n\n\\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any k. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't appear because the first expansion only goes up to \\(b^2\\), but to get \\(a^2b^2\\), you need to multiply by terms from the second expansion. Wait, no, in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from multiplying \\(a^2\\) from the first expansion by \\(b^2\\) from the second expansion, but the second expansion only has c terms, so actually, \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present because the second expansion doesn't have b terms. Hmm, so maybe in the original problem, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only from the first expansion, and the second expansion doesn't affect it. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient from the first expansion, which is 6, because the second expansion doesn't contribute to a or b. Wait, that makes sense. Because the second expansion only involves c and 1/c, so when you multiply, the a and b terms are only from the first expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just 6. \n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier thought. Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times something that doesn't involve a or b, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed just be 6, because the other factor doesn't contribute to a or b. So, in this problem, since the second factor is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which doesn't involve a or b, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first expansion, which is 6. \n\nI think that's the correct approach. Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients of terms that don't involve variables from the second expression remain the same. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and that's it. \n\nWait, but let me check another example to be sure. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Expanding the first part: \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). The second part: \\(c + 1/c\\). Now, when I multiply them, I get terms like \\(a^2c\\), \\(a^2 \\times 1/c\\), \\(2abc\\), \\(2ab \\times 1/c\\), \\(b^2c\\), and \\(b^2 \\times 1/c\\). So, in this product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't exist because the second expansion doesn't have any b terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero. Wait, that's different from my previous conclusion. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because you can't get \\(a^2b^2\\) from the product since the second factor doesn't contribute any b terms. Therefore, in the original problem, since the second factor is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which doesn't have any a or b terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first expansion, which is 6. But in my earlier example, the coefficient was zero because you couldn't form \\(a^2b^2\\) without b terms from the second expansion. Wait, but in the original problem, the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which doesn't have any a or b terms, so when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only from the first expansion, and the second expansion doesn't affect it. Therefore, the coefficient remains 6. \n\nWait, but in my example, I had \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) was zero because you couldn't get \\(a^2b^2\\) without multiplying by a term that has b^2 from the second expansion, which it doesn't. So, in the original problem, since the second expansion doesn't have any a or b terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first expansion, which is 6. Therefore, the answer should be 6. \n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me compute the product step by step. The first expansion gives me terms involving a and b, and the second expansion gives me terms involving c and 1/c. When I multiply them, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, but since they involve different variables, the product terms will have a combination of a, b, c, and 1/c. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from the first expansion, and it would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the coefficient from the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient from the second expansion. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of c, then it's actually the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Because each term in the second expansion contributes to a different power of c, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, so in my earlier example, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 2, so 6 * 2 = 12. But when I actually expand it, I don't see any \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, that approach must be wrong. Therefore, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first expansion, because the second expansion doesn't contribute to a or b. Therefore, the answer is 6. \n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\), then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first expansion, and it's multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which are all in terms of c. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\right)\\). So, each of these terms would have a coefficient of 6 times the coefficient from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6*1=6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 6*6=36, and so on. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all powers of c, is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c, then it's actually the sum of all these coefficients, which is 6*(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6*64=384. \n\nWait, but in my earlier example, that approach gave me a wrong answer. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating c as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c, then it's 384. But I'm not entirely sure. \n\nWait, let me think differently. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in the first expansion, and when multiplied by the second expansion, it becomes \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion. But since the second expansion is a polynomial in c, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the second expansion isn't a scalar. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it. \n\nI'm getting stuck here. Let me try to look for similar problems or think about how coefficients work in products of polynomials. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. But in this case, the desired term is \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve c or 1/c. So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiply it by the constant term from the second polynomial. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term involving c, you'll get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is not the same as \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial. \n\nSo, the first part gives us 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\). Now, the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The constant term in this expansion is when the exponent of c is zero. So, using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\times \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of c is zero, so 6 - 2k = 0, which gives k = 3. Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, that makes sense. Because to get \\(a^2b^2\\), you have to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and multiply it by the constant term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nLet me verify this with a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The first expansion is \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and the second expansion is \\(c + 1/c\\). The constant term in the second expansion is 0, because when k=0.5, which isn't possible, so there is no constant term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 0 = 0, which matches my earlier thought. \n\nAnother example: \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The first expansion is \\(a + b\\), the second is \\(c + 1/c\\). The constant term in the second expansion is 0, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 0, which makes sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present. \n\nTherefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nSo, to summarize, the steps are:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem to find the constant term (where the exponent of c is zero), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product: 6 * 20 = 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion is found by considering the product of the relevant terms from each part of the expression. \n\n1. From \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. From \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. Multiplying these coefficients gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I also need to expand this part, but I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\) are separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so actually, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\).

Wait, no, actually, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering all possible terms, but since \\(c\\) and \\(a, b\\) are separate variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, because when you multiply, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part.

So, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems high. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply the two expressions, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought earlier. But wait, is that correct? Let me think about it differently. Suppose I write the product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Since the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), then the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, the final answer should be 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense if we're considering the entire expression and looking for a specific term where both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, let me calculate that. To find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, so now I'm confused because earlier I thought it was 384, but now I'm thinking it's 120. Which one is correct? Let me go back to the problem statement. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" The way it's phrased, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, each of which has a different power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Since the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. However, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 * 20 = 120. But since it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 384. But wait, let me check an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be... Wait, but in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't exist because the first part only goes up to \\(a^2b^0\\) and \\(b^2a^0\\). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because you can't get \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^2\\). But wait, in our original problem, \\((a + b)^4\\) does have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so that's different. So, in the example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because it's not present. But in our problem, it is present. So, going back, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying \\(c\\), so I think it's 384. However, I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when variables are separate, people might only consider the part with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), but in this case, the entire expression includes both parts, so the coefficient would be multiplied by all terms from the second expansion. Let me try to think differently. Suppose I write the entire product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, which are all the terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct answer. Alternatively, if I consider that the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120, but I think the wording implies it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). So, I'll go with 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Consider the entire expression:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\n3. **Sum of coefficients in the second expansion:**\n   The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the coefficient:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of coefficients from the second part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

So, in the expansion, \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\), I need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^{2}b^{2}\\). The coefficient here is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which I think is 6 because \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider that as well. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Does that mean I need to consider the terms from the second part as well? Hmm, actually, no, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\). Therefore, when I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just the coefficient from the first part, right? Because the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). \n\nWait, but hold on, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the entire expression is a product of two expansions. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think I just need to consider the coefficient from the first expansion because the second expansion doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, maybe the coefficient is just 6, as I found earlier. \n\nBut wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, meaning after multiplying both expansions. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), their exponents won't be affected by the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the same as in the first part, regardless of the second part. So, maybe it's indeed 6. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the entire expansion as a single expression and look for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, but since \\(c\\) is another variable, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by some term from the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not multiplied by anything else, maybe I just need the coefficient from the first part. \n\nLet me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) which gives terms with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) which gives terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When I multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe the coefficient remains 6, and the terms involving \\(c\\) are separate. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is a bit different. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That would make sense because otherwise, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have coefficients multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), but if we want only the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., \\(c^0\\), then we need to consider that. \n\nWait, that might be the case. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, it's just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6. \n\nBut maybe I'm missing something. Let me try to think differently. Suppose I expand both parts separately and then multiply them. So, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^5 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c} + 15c^4 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^2} + 20c^3 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^3} + 15c^2 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^4} + 6c \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^5} + \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\). Simplifying that, it becomes \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^2} + 6 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^4} + \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\). \n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2 \\cdot 6c^4\\), and so on. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps it's just 6, as before, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. \n\nWait, but maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. In that case, I would need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second expansion. So, let's see. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20, as I found earlier. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion multiplied by 20 from the second expansion would give \\(20a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 20. \n\nWait, that makes sense because if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but considering the entire expression, it's actually looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in the second expansion. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), giving 120. \n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the sum of the products of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and each term from the second part. But if we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's just 6 times the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\). \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in other words, in the expanded form of this product, what is the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(c\\) is another variable, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. In that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient from the first part is 6, and the constant term from the second part is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nBut the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps it's just 6. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider the entire product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right because the question is asking for a numerical coefficient. \n\nWait, perhaps I need to look at the problem again. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the problem is considering \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as separate variables, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be a single number. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, regardless of the second part. So, in that case, it's 6. \n\nWait, let me try to think differently. If I consider the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then when expanded, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}c^{-m}\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nSo, if I'm looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), that means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for the second part, \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\), we need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because the problem is asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient from the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. \n\nWait, that makes sense. So, I think I was overcomplicating it earlier. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but since \\(c\\) is another variable, to have \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, we need to multiply it by the constant term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), giving 120. \n\nSo, to summarize, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. \n\nBut just to make sure, let me go through it again. \n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\):\n- The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNext, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n- The constant term (where \\(c^0\\)) comes from \\(m = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nMultiply these two coefficients together because in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion. So, \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):\n   - The term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   - The constant term (where \\(c^0\\)) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. Multiply the coefficients from both expansions:\n   - \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression in \\(c\\).\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression, and we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, we treat \\(c\\) as an independent variable, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a term that includes all possible powers of \\(c\\) multiplied by 6. But that can't be, because the coefficient should be a numerical factor in front of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) terms, but since it's not specified, perhaps the question is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, maybe the coefficient is just 6, as from the first part, because the second part doesn't influence the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. But that seems too straightforward. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply as well. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part.

So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, maybe the problem is only considering the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, so that the term is a constant, and then find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in that constant term.\n\nWait, that might be it. Because if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but without any \\(c\\) terms, then I need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is when the number of \\(c\\) terms equals the number of \\(1/c\\) terms, which happens when \\(k = 3\\), because then you have \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^3 (1/c)^3 = \\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\\). So, the constant term in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that seems plausible. Let me check. So, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient from the second part is 20. Then, the coefficient from the first part is 6, so when you multiply them together, you get 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that we're looking for the coefficient regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But in reality, each term in the product will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents and \\(c\\) exponents. So, unless specified, the coefficient would include all possible \\(c\\) terms, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is implicitly asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). So, that would mean we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion, which is 20, as we found earlier. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but that's not a numerical value, so it's likely that the problem is asking for the coefficient when the \\(c\\) terms are constant, i.e., the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, so the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, let me try another approach. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the sum of all coefficients, which is 2^6 = 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation.\n\nWait, but the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64, but that's when you set \\(c = 1\\). So, if you set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). But in the context of the problem, I don't think that's the right approach because we're not evaluating at \\(c = 1\\), but rather looking for specific terms. So, perhaps the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve multiplying the coefficient from the first part by the coefficient from the second part for each corresponding term, but since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) is the term where the second part is 1, i.e., the constant term. So, that would mean the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120, as I thought earlier.\n\nWait, let me confirm this with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). And \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to a sum of terms involving \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, 1, 1/c^2, 1/c^4, 1/c^6\\). So, when I multiply these two, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each of these terms, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\), with each coefficient multiplied by 6. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which, without any \\(c\\) terms specified, is ambiguous. So, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider only the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), i.e., the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, so that the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That would mean the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120, as I thought earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't seem right. So, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by the constant term in \\(c\\), so the answer is 120.\n\nWait, to make sure, let me think about how the product works. Each term in the product is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} (1/c)^m = \\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as before. So, for each \\(m\\) from 0 to 6, we have a term \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{2}b^{2}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). But that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), so unless we're looking for a specific coefficient in \\(c\\), the problem is probably asking for the coefficient when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) is 20. Multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " \n\nNow, I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need the term where \\(a\\) is raised to the power of 2 and \\(b\\) is also raised to the power of 2. So, in the expansion, the exponent of \\(a\\) is \\(4 - k\\) and the exponent of \\(b\\) is \\(k\\). I want \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, that would be the term when \\(k = 2\\). \n\nLet me calculate that term. The binomial coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). I remember that \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} = \\dfrac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\\). So, plugging in the numbers: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6, and the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I also have this other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is being multiplied by the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Hmm, so the entire expression is a product of two binomial expansions. \n\nNow, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply these two expansions together, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms will be multiplied by the terms from the \\(c\\) expansion. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, when I multiply the two expansions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Wait, is that right?\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply these, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), I need to find how many times \\(a^2b^2\\) appears in the product. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, it's only multiplied by the constant term (if any) from the second expansion. Wait, but \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) doesn't have a constant term, does it?\n\nLet me check. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will have terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). Wait, no, actually, the exponents go from 6 down to -6 in steps of 2. So, the term \\(c^0\\) is present, which is the middle term. So, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is the constant term. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), because in the expansion, the term \\(c^{6 - 3} \\times (1/c)^3 = c^{3} \\times c^{-3} = c^0\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand both, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the product of the coefficients from both parts, which is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and the constant term from the second part. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's only multiplied by the constant term. So, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is indeed 120. Alternatively, if I had to consider other terms, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any other term from the second expansion would introduce a \\(c\\) term, which would make the product have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the only contribution comes from the constant term in the second expansion. So, I think that's correct.\n\nJust to double-check, let me think about how the multiplication works. The first expansion has terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), \\(b^4\\). The second expansion has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when I multiply each term from the first expansion by each term from the second expansion, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, giving \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(120a^2b^2\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). \n\nBut the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire expression. But in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So, does the problem consider \\(a^2b^2\\) as a term on its own, regardless of \\(c\\), or is it considering \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\)? \n\nWait, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, in the entire expression, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that's multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). So, for example, \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., all have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). However, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is only present once, which is when multiplied by the constant term \\(20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120, as I thought earlier.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for a specific \\(k\\), then it would be different. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the only contribution is from the constant term. So, I think my answer is correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me think about the entire expansion. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\). Simplifying, that's \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, if I want the term where \\(a^{4 - k}b^k = a^2b^2\\), that means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as before. So, \\(k = 2\\), which gives the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), we have \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). So, in other words, we need to collect all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be the sum over all possible \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), but wait, no, because \\(m\\) is the index in the second expansion, so for each term in the second expansion, we multiply by the corresponding term in the first expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is fixed, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is equal to \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is when we set \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times 64\\). Wait, but that would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that contradicts my earlier conclusion of 120. Hmm, so I must be making a mistake here.\n\nWait, no, let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). So, in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). So, if we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's actually the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because in the expansion, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), that would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the entire second expansion, which is 64. So, the coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But earlier, I thought it was 120, which is 6 times 20, the constant term.\n\nI think I'm confused here. Let me clarify: when the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), does it mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), or just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\)? \n\nIf it's the former, then the coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384. If it's the latter, then it's 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nWait, looking back at the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's a bit ambiguous. But in algebra, when we talk about the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\), it's usually in the context of the entire expression, considering all variables. So, if the expression is in multiple variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would include all the factors from the other variables. \n\nWait, but in this case, the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by terms that include \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, in the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), 1, \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the sum of the coefficients of each of these terms when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nBut wait, no. Actually, each term in the expansion is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms would only be the term where \\(c^0\\), which is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, if we're considering \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nHmm, this is confusing. Let me think about it differently. Suppose I set \\(c = 1\\). Then, the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times (1 + 1)^6 = (a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). In this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But if I set \\(c = 1\\), I'm essentially evaluating the expression at \\(c = 1\\), which gives me the sum of all coefficients. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 384.\n\nBut if I don't set \\(c = 1\\), and I'm just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 120. Wait, but in reality, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that's being multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\), so in the entire expression, \\(a^2b^2\\) is present with coefficients multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So, if I'm just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the power of \\(c\\), it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 384. But if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\). So, in the context of the entire expression, which includes \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, that would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nBut that seems counterintuitive because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that's being multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\), so in the entire expression, \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in multiple terms, each multiplied by a different power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first expansion. \n\nWait, but no, that's not quite right. Each term in the product is a combination of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes different powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6 times 1, which is 6. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 6 times 6, which is 36. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^2\\) is 6 times 15, which is 90. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 20, which is 120. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\) is 6 times 15, which is 90. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{-4}\\) is 6 times 6, which is 36. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\) is 6 times 1, which is 6.\n\nSo, in the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in all these forms, each multiplied by a different power of \\(c\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's the sum of all these coefficients, which would be 6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6. Let me add that up: 6 + 36 is 42, plus 90 is 132, plus 120 is 252, plus 90 is 342, plus 36 is 378, plus 6 is 384. So, the total coefficient is 384.\n\nBut wait, that seems like a lot. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's just 120. So, I think the problem is probably asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120. Because otherwise, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it would have specified something like \"the sum of coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" or \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression\", but it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the context of multiple variables, usually refers to the coefficient when considering all variables. \n\nWait, but in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But I think that's incorrect because when you have multiple variables, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, for \\(a^2b^2\\), it's 6, and for the second part, it's the coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), which is any term in the second expansion. But I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to consider that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum over all coefficients from the first polynomial times the coefficients from the second polynomial where the product results in \\(a^2b^2\\). But since the second polynomial doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear is by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial by any term from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nSo, the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 120, considering only the constant term. So, which is it?\n\nI think the confusion arises from whether we're considering \\(a^2b^2\\) as a term on its own, regardless of \\(c\\), or as a term multiplied by \\(c^0\\). If it's the former, then it's 384. If it's the latter, it's 120. \n\nLooking back at the problem statement: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" The problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, it's 384.\n\nBut wait, that seems high. Let me check with an example. Let's consider a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). So, expanding, we get \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The expansion is \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). Now, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a term, not a coefficient. Wait, but coefficients are numerical factors. So, in this case, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\), it's \\(c + 1/c\\), but that's not a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps in this problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is considered as the sum of all coefficients when \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, in the simple case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be \\(c + 1/c\\), but that's not a number. So, perhaps in the context of the problem, they are considering the coefficient as a numerical coefficient, meaning that \\(c\\) must be raised to the zero power. \n\nWait, that makes sense. Because in the problem, they're asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear as a standalone term is when it's multiplied by \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nSo, I think I was right the first time. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so we need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nTo confirm, let's think about the entire expression. If I set \\(c = 1\\), the expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times (1 + 1)^6 = (a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). In this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that's when \\(c = 1\\), which is not the case we're considering. We're considering \\(c\\) as a variable, so \\(a^2b^2\\) must be multiplied by \\(c^0\\) to be a standalone term. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nYes, I think that's the correct approach. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"
