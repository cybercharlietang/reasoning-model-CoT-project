    "text": " \n\nNow, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I'm looking for the term where the power of \\(a\\) is 2 and the power of \\(b\\) is 2. Let me see what \\(k\\) would be in this case. Since the exponent on \\(b\\) is \\(k\\), and we want \\(k = 2\\), because \\(b^2\\) is what we're looking for. So, substituting \\(k = 2\\) into the binomial coefficient, we get \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient. However, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would actually be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), does that mean the coefficient remains the same? Or do I need to consider something else?\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part would be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is just the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient remains 6. Is that right?\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because when you multiply the two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that can't be right because the question is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because otherwise, if it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems complicated. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, so it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nBut wait, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of coefficients is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, that seems high. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that means the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 * \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's an expression, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That would make more sense because then it's a specific term.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought earlier.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm wrong because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is present in the product as \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's just 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me think differently. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) is to the power of zero. That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. That would require me to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term, and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part.\n\nLet me try that approach. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already found to be 6. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do that, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, I think that's the answer. But wait, earlier I thought it was 384, but that was when considering all \\(c\\) terms, but perhaps the problem is asking for the term where \\(c\\) is also zero, which would make it a specific term. Since the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\), I'm a bit confused.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again carefully: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't mention anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's indeed just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, that can't be right because the coefficient would then be a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120, as I calculated earlier.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that would mean the coefficient is 384, which is a number, so that could make sense. But I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120. So, which one is it?\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of it as a two-variable expression, but actually, it's three variables: \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking about \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering the coefficient in the entire product, regardless of \\(c\\). So, that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's the intended interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Let me see if that makes sense. In the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is of the form \\(a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), which gives us the coefficient 6. Then, for each such term, we multiply by the term from the second expansion, which has \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), we need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\), as before, with coefficient 20. So, the combined coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check another approach. Suppose I consider the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, I think it must be referring to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me think about how the product works. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), meaning that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, perhaps it's expecting the coefficient when considering all terms, but that doesn't make much sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, and thus the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion, but that would be a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), so the entire product becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this case would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120.\n\nI think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120, because otherwise, it's a bit of an odd question. So, I'll go with 120 as the answer.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), giving the coefficient:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term (\\(c^0\\)) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, right? So that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me compute that term. The coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6, and then the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nWait, but the problem isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, but the question is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and then multiply it by the entire second part? Or is there more to it?\n\nWait, no, because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only comes from the first part \\((a + b)^4\\), and since the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term won't be affected by the second part. So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times whatever the entire second part is? But that doesn't make sense because the second part is raised to the 6th power. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nLet me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I expand each part separately, the first part will have terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), etc., and the second part will have terms involving \\(c^6\\), \\(c^5 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c} = c^4\\), and so on, down to \\(c^0 = 1\\). But when I multiply these two expansions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will get multiplied by every term in the second expansion. However, the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only come from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part multiplied by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) in the second part. Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any other term in the second part, it would introduce \\(c\\) terms, which would make it not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think that's the key here.\n\nSo, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply these two, you get \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0 = a^2b^2\\), which is the term we're interested in.\n\nI already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that part. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nI need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, I need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), I get \\(6 = 2m\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients I found: 6 (from the first part) and 20 (from the second part). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) which is 20. Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. So, yeah, that seems correct. I don't think I made a mistake here. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is also found using the binomial theorem, giving 20. Multiplying these coefficients together results in 120.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"

    "text": " Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), which means \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. Now, the expression also has another part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I notice that this part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so maybe it's just a constant multiplier when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that might not be correct because the second part is another binomial expansion. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire expression, which is a product of two binomial expansions. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. However, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), right? Because in \\((a + b)^4\\), all terms are just in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the entire expansion of the second part would include terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe we just need to consider the constant term in the second expansion. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion, that would give you a term with \\(a^2b^2\\), whereas multiplying by non-constant terms would give you terms with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), which aren't \\(a^2b^2\\) alone. So, perhaps the coefficient we're looking for is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me check that. So, first, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, which includes terms with \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't have any \\(c\\) in it. So, only the term where the second factor is \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) will contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, making the term not just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the only contribution comes from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term, which is 20. So, the coefficient is indeed \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me double-check. Suppose I consider the entire expansion. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has a term \\(20c^0\\), which is 20. So, when I multiply these two, I get \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, if I consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then it's just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But no, that's not right because the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\). So, only the constant term in the second part contributes. So, yes, the coefficient is 120. I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.

    "text": " \n\nI need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, in the expansion, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). To get \\(a^2b^2\\), I need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, substituting \\(k = 2\\) into the binomial coefficient, I get \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are only in the second part, the \\(c\\) terms won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. That means, when I multiply the two expansions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). \n\nWait, let me think again. So, the entire expression is the product of two expansions. The first expansion has terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second expansion has terms in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply them, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product will just be the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion. But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, and then you combine like terms. However, in this case, the first polynomial has terms with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all different variables, their exponents won't interfere with each other. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will only come from the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by any term in the second expansion. But wait, that can't be right because that would mean the coefficient is multiplied by the entire second expansion, which is a sum of terms. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, but the variables are separate. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will only come from the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the constant term (if any) in the second expansion. But wait, the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded will have terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but no constant term unless there's a term where the exponents cancel out. Let me check: the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponents of \\(c\\) will be \\(6 - 2m\\), where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. So, the exponents will be 6, 4, 2, 0, -2, -4, -6. So, there is a constant term when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which occurs when \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is multiplied by the constant term 20 in the second expansion, and all other terms in the second expansion will have some power of \\(c\\), which won't combine with \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the constant term from the second part. So, that would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When I expand both, I get a sum of terms where each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. For example, a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion multiplied by \\(c^k\\) from the second expansion will give \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). But since the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think I need to consider all terms where the product results in \\(a^2b^2\\), which would require that the term from the second expansion is a constant term, because otherwise, there would be a \\(c\\) term attached. Therefore, the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) is the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", but in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, the term would actually be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But wait, no, that's not how it works. Because each term in the product is a distinct term, so \\(a^2b^2\\) can only be paired with the constant term in the second expansion to form a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). If there's a \\(c\\) term, then the term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is a different term. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's just the coefficient from the first expansion times the constant term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), then we would have to consider the product of the coefficients from both expansions for each \\(k\\). But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's safe to assume that it's referring to the coefficient when \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power, i.e., the constant term. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check the problem again. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's in the product of these two expressions. So, in the product, each term is a combination of terms from both expansions. So, for a term to be \\(a^2b^2\\), it must come from \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by a term that is \\(c^0\\) in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed the product of the coefficients from both parts. So, 6 from the first part and 20 from the second part, giving 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), then we would have to consider the product of the coefficients from both expansions for that specific \\(k\\). But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's referring to the coefficient when \\(c\\) is at the zero power, meaning the constant term. So, I think 120 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I'm misinterpreting the question. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, meaning that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire second expansion, which doesn't make sense because the second expansion is a sum of terms, not a single coefficient. So, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would have to compute it differently. But as it stands, I think 120 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let's consider the entire expansion. The first part is \\((a + b)^4\\), which gives terms up to \\(a^4b^0\\) and down to \\(a^0b^4\\). The second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which gives terms with \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, c^0, c^{-2}, c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\). So, when you multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), because any other term would have a \\(c\\) power attached. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think I've considered this from multiple angles, and each time, I arrive at the same conclusion. So, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n$\\boxed{120}$"

    "text": " That means the expansion will have terms like \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\), and so on, up to \\(\\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I should focus on the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would be when \\(k = 2\\) in the binomial expansion. So, the coefficient there is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is equal to \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, the problem is that the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I have to consider the product of these two expansions. That is, \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second part of the expression, which is in terms of \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will multiply each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't need to worry about the other terms in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, the result will still be \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself won't change unless there's a term in the second expansion that affects the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, but actually, no. Because the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\), it doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, it just adds a multiple to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, that's not quite right. Because the second expansion is a separate polynomial, each term in it will multiply each term in the first expansion. So, for example, if I have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion and a term \\(c^3\\) in the second expansion, their product will be \\(a^2b^2c^3\\), which is a different term. But the problem is asking only for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, actually, it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that can't be right because in the expansion, each term will have a combination of powers of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But that seems a bit unclear. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms, so that the coefficient itself is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But I think that's not the case. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicking this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. Simplifying the second part, \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^m} = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in the product is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need to find all the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That is, \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), which we already found gives a coefficient of 6 from the first part. Now, for each such term, we need to consider all possible values of \\(m\\) in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But wait, no. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a single term from the first expansion, and when multiplied by each term in the second expansion, it will produce terms like \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of the coefficients from each multiplication. That is, for each \\(m\\) from 0 to 6, the coefficient contributed to \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). So, the total coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Wait, but that can't be right because \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large. Wait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Because if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then yes, that's correct. But perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that each term in the product will have some power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a sum of the products of the coefficients from each expansion. Wait, let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^m}\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, for each \\(m\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the total coefficient would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that seems too straightforward, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, meaning that it's part of a larger expression where each term has specific powers of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). But the way the problem is phrased, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which might imply that it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be the sum of all the contributions from each \\(m\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). That would make more sense. Let me check that possibility. If that's the case, then we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would require that the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. From the earlier expression, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). So, to have \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), we solve for \\(m\\): \\(6 - 2m = 0 \\Rightarrow m = 3\\). So, only when \\(m = 3\\) do we get a term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\) and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). But the problem didn't specify the \\(c^0\\) term, so I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384 as I calculated earlier. But that seems too large, and I suspect that the intended answer is 120, assuming that the problem is asking for the constant term in \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, without considering \\(c\\), which would be 6, but that seems unlikely because the entire expression includes \\(c\\). Wait, but actually, no, because the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the coefficients of the terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are multiplied by the entire expansion of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of the products of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial with each term in the second polynomial. But that would mean that the coefficient is actually a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Alternatively, maybe the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) with the entire expression, and the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but that would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is intended to be just \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part is a red herring, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which is ambiguous. Given that, perhaps the intended answer is 6, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, which would mean that the coefficient is the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, because the other part is multiplied by each term, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's just 6. But that seems too simple, and I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would involve summing over all the possible contributions from the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a single coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. As I calculated earlier, that would be when \\(m = 3\\), giving a coefficient of \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, perhaps that's the intended answer. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem didn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so that seems unlikely. Given that, I think the most reasonable interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, I'll go with that.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would produce terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various exponents \\(k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that \\(c\\) must be raised to the zero power in that term. So, I think I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by 6 to get the final coefficient. So, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) gives \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me check again. \\(6! = 720\\), \\(3! = 6\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 720 / (6 * 6) = 720 / 36 = 20\\). Yes, that's correct. So, the constant term in the second part is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the first part's coefficient is 6, and the second part's constant term is 20, so when we multiply them, it's 6*20=120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Hmm, that seems right. Let me just go through it again to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any calculation errors. Starting with \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k=2\\), so \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m=3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying those together gives 6*20=120. Yeah, that seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes here.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{120}"

    "text": " That means each term in the expansion will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. So, the terms will be:\n\n- When \\(k = 0\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 = 1 \\cdot a^4\\)\n- When \\(k = 1\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 = 4a^3b\\)\n- When \\(k = 2\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\)\n- When \\(k = 3\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 = 4ab^3\\)\n- When \\(k = 4\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4 = 1 \\cdot b^4\\)\n\nSo, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think the next step is to expand this second part as well and then see how the terms combine.\n\nLet me first expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem again. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m}\\) which is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) where \\(m\\) goes from 0 to 6. Let me write out the terms:\n\n- When \\(m = 0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1 \\cdot c^6\\)\n- When \\(m = 1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^4 = 6c^4\\)\n- When \\(m = 2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^2 = 15c^2\\)\n- When \\(m = 3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20 \\cdot 1 = 20\\)\n- When \\(m = 4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- When \\(m = 5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- When \\(m = 6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\).\n\nNow, the original expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, we can focus on how this term interacts with the second expansion.\n\nSo, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the entire coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times each power of \\(c\\) will be 6 times the coefficients from the second expansion. But wait, the problem doesn't specify anything about the powers of \\(c\\); it just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, we need to collect all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and then sum their coefficients. So, in other words, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so each of those products will be terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 6c^4\\), etc. But since the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps I'm supposed to consider the entire product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables. So, perhaps I need to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because the second part is multiplied by the first part, so when we multiply, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\).\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When we expand this product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, for example, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 6c^4\\), etc. So, each of these terms will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's asking for the sum of all coefficients where the \\(a^2b^2\\) term appears, regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some combination of \\(c\\) terms, but since it's not specified, I think it's more likely that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6.\n\nWait, no, that might not be correct. Let me clarify. The term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, each product will have \\(6a^2b^2\\) times a term involving \\(c\\). Therefore, in the entire expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 6*6=36, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^2\\) is 6*15=90, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (since c^0 is 1) is 6*20=120, and so on for the negative exponents. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Now, here's the confusion: does it mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\), or just \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\)? If it's the former, then the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. But if it's the latter, meaning the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), then it's just 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion.\n\nWait, but the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which expands to terms with various powers of \\(c\\), including \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, 1, c^{-2}, c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\). So, when we multiply by \\(6a^2b^2\\), each term becomes \\(6a^2b^2c^6, 36a^2b^2c^4, 90a^2b^2c^2, 120a^2b^2, 90a^2b^2c^{-2}, 36a^2b^2c^{-4}, 6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). So, each of these terms has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Because each term \\(6a^2b^2c^{k}\\) contributes 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion.\n\nBut wait, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when we set \\(c = 1\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the problem statement: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any mention of \\(c\\). That suggests that we are to treat \\(c\\) as another variable and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, we're looking for all terms in the expansion where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the exponent on \\(c\\), and sum their coefficients.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient would be the sum of 6 times each coefficient from the second expansion. So, as I thought earlier, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion. Since the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64, then 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, which would mean that the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). That would make more sense.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying any power of \\(c\\). So, maybe it's referring to the coefficient when considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that's a bit ambiguous. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to consider the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and find the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). But that's not standard. Usually, when a coefficient is asked for without specifying other variables, it's considered in the context of treating the other variables as constants. But in this case, since \\(c\\) is another variable, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). That would mean that we're looking for all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), and summing their coefficients.\n\nBut that would lead to the coefficient being 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in the second expansion, which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let's check the second expansion again. The constant term is when \\(c^0\\), which is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient there is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, without considering \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a single coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the intended interpretation is that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the product as a polynomial in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), with coefficients that are polynomials in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the polynomial \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's not a single number, so that can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). So, that would be 6 * 20 = 120. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, let's think differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^6\\) is 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^4\\) is 6*6=36, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^2\\) is 6*15=90, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times 1 is 6*20=120, and so on for the negative exponents. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the total coefficient would be the sum of all these coefficients, which is 6*(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6*(64) = 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's just 120.\n\nBut I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, that would be 384. However, I'm not entirely sure. Let me see if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to consider that \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables, and \\(c\\) is another variable, but the coefficient is being considered in the context of treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the polynomial formed by multiplying 6 by each term in the second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense as a single coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when the product is expanded, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but that would require summing all the coefficients from the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), which would mean summing over all coefficients. Alternatively, maybe it's intended to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when the product is expanded, treating \\(c\\) as a constant, but that doesn't make sense because \\(c\\) is a variable.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written in a way that the entire expression is a product, and we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, but then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is not a single number.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part and \\(c\\) is in another, the expansion will have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^{6 - 2m}\\) where \\(k\\) is from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) is from 0 to 6. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), and for each \\(m\\), we have a term \\(6a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\) in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying \\(c\\), perhaps it's intended to sum over all possible \\(m\\), so the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as variables, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a single coefficient. Therefore, the only logical conclusion is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. If I multiply the two expansions, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Since the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), but without specifying any particular power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but since the problem is asking for a single coefficient, it's more likely that it's intended to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check the problem again. It says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". It doesn't mention \\(c\\) at all. So, perhaps it's intended to treat \\(c\\) as a separate variable and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be a sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut I'm still unsure. Let me see if there's another way to interpret this. Perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\). But that's not the case because the product involves \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is intended to have \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as separate variables, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a single number, so that can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering that \\(c\\) is another variable, but the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, the problem is asking for a single coefficient, so that's not possible. Therefore, the only logical conclusion is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when the product is expanded, treating \\(c\\) as a constant. But that's not correct because \\(c\\) is a variable.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to have the product as a single expression, and we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that's not a single number, so perhaps the problem is intended to have \\(c\\) set to 1, making the second part equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\), so the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me see if I can find any similar problems online to check. Hmm, I can't access the internet, but I can reason it out. Typically, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a term in a product of two expressions, it's considering the entire product, and the coefficient would be a combination of the coefficients from each part. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since the problem is asking for a single coefficient, perhaps it's intended to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when the product is expanded, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, but that would result in a polynomial, not a single number. Therefore, the only way for the coefficient to be a single number is if we're considering the sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut I'm still not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Let me think about how the problem is phrased: \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". It doesn't specify any \\(c\\), so perhaps it's intended to consider all possible \\(c\\) terms, making the coefficient 384.\n\nWait, another approach: the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, each term in the product that has \\(a^2b^2\\) will have some power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, that would be 6*(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6*64 = 384.\n\nYes, I think that's the correct approach. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) appears in the first part with coefficient 6. When we multiply by the second part, which has terms with coefficients 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\) is 6*(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6*64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense.

    "text": " I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would correspond to the term where \\(a^{2}b^{2}\\). That would happen when \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I have to consider the expansion of both parts and multiply them together. But wait, the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That suggests that I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the coefficient of the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), since multiplying by 6 would give the overall coefficient. \n\nWait, but let me make sure. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, it will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would mean that we need the term in the second expansion that is a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), because when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a constant, it remains \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant. If we had a term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), it would introduce \\(c\\) terms into the product, which would make the term \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, we need the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(6 = 2m\\) \u2192 \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me just verify that. So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and to get the term \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to multiply it by the constant term from the second expansion, which is 20. So, yes, 6 times 20 is 120. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as the product of two expansions, but since we're only interested in terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are such that they cancel out, leading to a constant term. So, indeed, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. Let me just recap: For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. Multiplying them together gives 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we need the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nThe constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). The constant term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nMultiplying the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we get:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Now, I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which means \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the value of \\(k\\) such that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me check: if \\(k = 2\\), then \\(4 - 2 = 2\\), so yes, that's the term. The coefficient for this term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I notice that this part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so maybe it's just a constant factor when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but actually, since we're multiplying the two expressions together, the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will multiply each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the other parts (involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\)) will just contribute a factor that's multiplied by the 6 we found earlier. So, to clarify, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, actually, no. Because when we multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), the terms from the second part don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) and some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Oh, so perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, we're looking for all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and for each such term, the coefficient would include the product of the coefficients from both expansions. But wait, no, because the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when we multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient isn't a single number but a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering the entire product, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit strange because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would include terms with \\(c\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which might not be what the problem is asking for. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible combinations, so it's 6 multiplied by the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make much sense either. Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) and some combination of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, and since the second part is independent, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion would be when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, if I multiply 6 by 64, I get 384. But is that correct? Let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But if we are to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible exponents of \\(c\\), then the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and not considering the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is part of the product. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would require multiplying the coefficients from both expansions. Wait, but the second expansion doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But again, that's a polynomial, not a single number. Maybe the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the second part is a separate expansion. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^4\\), but that's just speculation. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of \\(c\\), so it's 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not a single number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all terms, so the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. Then, this term is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But if the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, perhaps it's expecting the sum of all coefficients, which would be 6 times 64, as I thought before, which is 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). That would make more sense. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and multiply it by 6. Let me calculate that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be written as \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the exponent to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering only the constant term in \\(c\\) is 120. But the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical answer. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^4\\), but that's just a guess. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of \\(c\\), so the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not a number. So, I'm confused. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, and since \\(c\\) is another variable, the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of the second part. So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But if we're supposed to write the coefficient as a number, perhaps it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Alternatively, if we're supposed to consider only the constant term in \\(c\\), then it's 6 times 20, which is 120.

Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But that's a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, I think the intended answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check one more time. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms like \\(a^4, a^3b, a^2b^2, ab^3, b^4\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which expands to terms like \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, 1, \\dfrac{1}{c^2}, \\dfrac{1}{c^4}, \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\). So, when I multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, if the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, perhaps it's asking for the sum of all coefficients in the entire product for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. The sum of the coefficients in the second part is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, 6 times 64 is 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 6 times 20, which is 120. But since the problem didn't specify, I think the intended answer is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm going in circles here. Let me try to think differently.

    "text": " I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me check that. If \\(k = 2\\), then the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). The binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. Okay, so that's the first part done. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the expansion of this part as well. But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, does that mean I need to consider the entire expansion, or just focus on the part where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by something else? Wait, no, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of those involving \\(c\\). That means, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that can't be right because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\). So maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When we multiply these two expressions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, and we don't care about the \\(c\\) terms, maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be a numerical coefficient, not involving \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me approach it differently. Let me consider the entire expression as a product of two separate expansions. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) expands to terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent, the product will have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or something like that. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean that any term in the expansion that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and we just need to sum all those contributions? Wait, but in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, because every term in the second expansion will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the exponents of \\(c\\) don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, in the entire product, collect all terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\), each multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), and then sum their coefficients. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), which isn't a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Wait, no, the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which suggests that it's considering the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that's a bit unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is treating \\(c\\) as another variable, and the expression is a product of two polynomials, and we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems odd because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try a different approach. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\) in the entire product. That makes more sense. So, the approach would be: first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I found earlier. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply these two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. Okay, that seems reasonable. So, let's proceed with that. First, I've already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To do this, I'll use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me compute it correctly. \\(6! = 720\\), \\(3! = 6\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Yes, that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, since the original expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, that's 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. When you multiply these two parts together, every term in the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But we're only interested in the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which is the constant term, so that's 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the answer should be 120. Let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make any errors. 1. Expanded \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem and found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. 2. Expanded \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem and found the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. 3. Multiplied these two coefficients together to get 120. Yes, that seems correct. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found to be 20. Multiplying these together yields 120.\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can focus on the term where \\(k = 2\\). So, that term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^{2}b^{2}\\). Calculating the binomial coefficient, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the expression also has \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I think I can expand this part separately using the binomial theorem as well.

However, since the second part only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the variables involved are different.

    "text": " Now, I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2 because the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let me find the value of \\(k\\) such that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). That makes sense because if \\(k = 2\\), then \\(4 - 2 = 2\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). Now, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I think that since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part is multiplied by that, the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will just be a constant factor. Wait, is that correct? Let me think. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and the second part is being multiplied by it. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 multiplied by whatever the constant term is from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will just be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term. Because any other term would have a \\(c\\) raised to some power, which would make the entire term have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something, which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient we're looking for is 6 times the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, let's find that constant term. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the term where the exponent is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, I expanded \\((a + b)^4\\) and found the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) which had a coefficient of 6. Then, I considered that this term is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), I needed the constant term from the second expansion, which I found by setting the exponent of \\(c\\) to zero, leading to \\(m = 3\\), and the constant term being 20.

    "text": " \n\nI need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the expansion, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the problem is the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, so I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of these two expressions. But hold on, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\), right? So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will multiply with the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't care about the \\(c\\) terms, because any term involving \\(c\\) will just be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), but I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not any \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but actually, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a sum of terms involving various powers of \\(c\\), when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those terms, each will contribute a different term in the product. However, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself (without any \\(c\\) terms) would only come from the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, and thus wouldn't be just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, I think I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). That makes sense because only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero will result in a term that is just a constant times \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) factors. \n\nSo, let me first find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Since these two coefficients are multiplied together in the product, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and when multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20, the combined term is \\(6 \\times 20 \\times a^2b^2c^0 = 120a^2b^2\\). So, yes, the coefficient is 120. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about the entire expansion. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanding this product, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we have to find the term in the second expansion that doesn't involve \\(c\\) either, i.e., the constant term. That's exactly what I did earlier, finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20. So, multiplying 6 by 20 gives 120, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. \n\nLet me check if there's another way to approach this. Maybe by considering the multinomial theorem or something else. But I think the approach I took is correct. I expanded each part separately, found the necessary coefficients, and then multiplied them together because the variables are independent. So, I think the answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficients found above. Therefore, the coefficient is:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

Since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I might not need to worry about the second part of the product, right?

But since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), maybe I can consider the entire coefficient as just the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part? Wait, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. \n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it doesn't affect the exponent of \\(a\\) or \\(b\\).

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part is a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, no, that doesn't sound quite right. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but that would mean the coefficient is not just a single number, which contradicts the question. So, perhaps I'm missing something. \n\nWait, no, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem only specifies \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering the coefficient as a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is phrased as asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would typically be a constant. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), so effectively, the coefficient is the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from the second part. But that might not be correct either. \n\nWait, let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part comes from \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\), which is 6a^2b^2. Now, when you multiply this by the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the second part is a term like \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(6a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the question is asking for a numerical coefficient. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too high. Wait, no, because when you set \\(c = 1\\), you get the sum of the coefficients, but in reality, each term in the second expansion has a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 6*(c + 1/c)^6, meaning the coefficient is 6*(c + 1/c)^6, which is a polynomial, not a constant. \n\nWait, this is confusing. Maybe the problem is intended to consider only the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the \\(c\\) terms must cancel out, so we're looking for the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because that would be the only term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would give a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in the second expansion. \n\nSo, let's break it down. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, as we found earlier. Now, in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we need the constant term, which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. To find that, we can use the binomial theorem again. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. \n\nSo, the constant term in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, when we multiply the two parts together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in the second expansion is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me double-check. So, the first part gives 6a^2b^2, and the second part, when expanded, has a constant term of 20. So, multiplying them together, the term would be 6 * 20 a^2b^2, which is 120a^2b^2. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would indeed be 120. But if it's considering the entire expansion, including all powers of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6*(c + 1/c)^6, which is a polynomial, but I think the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, so 120 is likely the correct answer. \n\nWait, but let me make sure. So, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), 20, \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each of these, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(120a^2b^2\\), etc. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 120. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. However, if the problem is just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the entire expansion of the second part multiplied by 6, which is 6*(c + 1/c)^6. But that's a polynomial, not a single coefficient. So, I think the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in the second expansion, which is 120. \n\nTherefore, after this lengthy thought process, I think the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the final coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Let me think about that. \n\nWhen you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression.

But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should just be a number, not an expression. Maybe I'm misunderstanding something here.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, and when I multiply it by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since I'm just looking for the coefficient, and not the entire term, maybe it's just the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part. Wait, no, that can't be right either because each term in the second part would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), they don't interact. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems odd because the coefficient should be a single number, not a polynomial in \\(c\\).\n\nWait, maybe I'm misapplying the concept. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), that is, it's a term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, I need to find all the terms in the second expansion \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that result in \\(c^0\\), because when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression.\n\nSo, to clarify, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) is just \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term we're interested in.\n\nSo, first, as I calculated before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we have terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the exponent to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\nWait, let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).

    "text": " That means the expansion will have terms like \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\), and so on, up to \\(\\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that corresponds to the term where \\(k = 2\\), because \\(4 - k = 2\\) implies \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the expression also has the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm a bit confused here because I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but this part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Wait, does this mean that the entire expression is a product of two binomial expansions? So, it's \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, but I'm only asked about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by whatever the coefficient is for the term that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), but just \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the problem is the product of both expressions. So, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions together, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that can't be right because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not a product. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some combination of \\(c\\) terms, but since it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the other variables are irrelevant. So, perhaps the answer is just 6, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), because the other part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). But that seems too simple. Let me check.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. But in the product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). Therefore, when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) variables. So, the coefficient would just be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just 6. But that seems too straightforward. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written differently. Let me check again: \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the variables are separate, so when you multiply, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are independent of the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression. Therefore, I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that we're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so that the term is a pure number. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. That makes more sense. So, perhaps the problem is written as \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, implying that we're looking for the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\).\n\nSo, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that would make the overall coefficient 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nOkay, so now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(k = 3\\) will have \\(c^0\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but the problem just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, maybe I'm overcomplicating again. Let me clarify: in the product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider all possible terms in the product where the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents are 2 and 2, respectively. But since the \\(c\\) terms are separate, the coefficient would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a single number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of all coefficients in a binomial expansion is found by setting the variable to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem didn't specify anything about the \\(c\\) terms.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it again. Let me think differently. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). Now, when you multiply this by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But that would mean 6 times 64, which is 384, as I thought earlier. But that seems too big, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the coefficient. So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6, and the rest of the terms involving \\(c\\) are separate. But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term is multiplied by every other term, so the coefficient would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would make it a polynomial, not a single coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating all variables as separate, but only considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts. So, maybe the answer is just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms don't influence the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. But that seems too simplistic, and I'm not sure if that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written in a way that the entire expression is a product, and we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But as I calculated earlier, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. But I'm not sure if that's the intended interpretation.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. So, the coefficient remains 6.\n\nWait, but that seems too simple, and I'm probably missing something. Let me check an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Expanding this, \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because in the first expansion, the highest power of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is 2 each, but when multiplied by the second expansion, which has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the coefficient is zero. But according to my earlier logic, the coefficient would be 1 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^2\\)) times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), so 1 times 2 is 2, but that's not correct because the actual coefficient is zero. Therefore, my earlier approach must be wrong.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is that when you multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion and the constant term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. That makes more sense because in the product, you're combining like terms. So, in the example I just thought of, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 1 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 1, so the coefficient is 1, but in reality, when you expand \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term isn't present because you can't have \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, actually, in that case, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so it would be \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), not \\(a^2b^2\\) alone. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is zero, which aligns with the idea that you need to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by the \\(c^0\\) term to get \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the example, the second expansion doesn't have a \\(c^0\\) term when the exponent is 1. So, that would mean the coefficient is zero, which is correct.\n\nTherefore, applying this to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, as I calculated earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the overall coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but in my earlier example, when I had \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 1 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. But in that case, the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1 = c + 1/c\\), which doesn't have a \\(c^0\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 1 times 0, which is 0, which is correct. So, applying this logic to the original problem, since the second expansion does have a \\(c^0\\) term, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\) gives \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient for this term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficients found above:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

Let me see, in the expansion, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, if I set \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), then \\(k\\) would be 2 as well. That makes sense because \\(4 - 2 = 2\\) for \\(a\\) and \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). Okay, so the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to figure out if this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\), right? So, when I multiply the two expressions together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, actually, that's not quite right because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), it can only come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) in the second part. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any other term from the second expansion, it would introduce a \\(c\\) term, which we don't want.\n\nSo, that means I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nI need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), I get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, let me double-check that calculation. 6! is 720, and 3! is 6, so 6!/(3!3!) is 720/(6*6) = 720/36 = 20. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, the constant term in the second part is 20. Therefore, when I multiply the two expansions together, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The original expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanding, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. However, since we're only interested in terms where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\), which don't involve \\(c\\), the only way that happens is if we take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and multiply it by the constant term from the second expansion.

Now, the expression is multiplied by another part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider this as well. But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Does that mean I don't have to worry about the \\(c\\) terms? Or do I need to consider how the \\(c\\) terms might affect the coefficient? Hmm, let me think. The expression is a product of two parts: one involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other involving \\(c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, their exponents won't interfere with each other. So, when I multiply the two expansions together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider the coefficient of that term in the first part and then multiply it by the entire second part, because the \\(c\\) terms won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, if I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can treat the second part as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, if I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\) times \\( (c + 1/c)^6 \\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part is in \\(c\\), the \\(c\\) terms will just be multiplied along with the coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables are separate. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the same as in the first part, multiplied by each term in the second part. But since the second part is in \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). However, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because in the product, each term is a combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only be present if the second part doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms. But that's not the case. So, actually, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) varies. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second part, but that doesn't make sense because the second part has different variables. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are distinct, so when you multiply the two expressions, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, for example, \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply that we're only looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). Wait, but that's not possible because in the product, each term has both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only appear if the second part has a term with \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term. Because otherwise, the term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is some exponent, but not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, so to speak. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find both coefficients and then multiply them together. I already found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). We need the exponent to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, but let me double-check that. Is the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product? Yes, because any other term would have a non-zero exponent of \\(c\\), making it \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k \\neq 0\\), which is not just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the only contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part by the constant term in the second part. So, yes, 6 times 20 is 120. I think that's correct. Let me summarize: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Now, I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2 because the problem is asking for \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to find the term where \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), which would mean \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder if I need to consider this part as well. Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Let me think. So, the expression is a product of two separate binomial expansions. So, when you multiply them together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), maybe the coefficient from the second part is just 1? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is a product, so when we take the product, the coefficients multiply as well. But in this case, since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way that term can come about is if we take the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by the term that has \\(c^0\\) from the second part, because \\(c^0 = 1\\), which doesn't affect the exponent. So, I think I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the product of the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) and the coefficient from the constant term in the second part. So, let me calculate the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). I need the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 * 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, actually, let me recalculate that because 6! is 720, but 3! is 6, so 6!/(3!3!) is 720/(6*6) = 720/36 = 20. Yes, that's correct. So, the constant term in the second part is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from both parts, which is 6 * 20 = 120.

Wait, is that correct? Let me think. When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficients for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the product of the coefficients from each expansion. But in this case, the second part doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, so when I multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part would just be multiplied by the entire second part, but since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the other terms (involving \\(c\\)) won't affect it. Wait, no, actually, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and then multiply by any term in the second part, the resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). But the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply that we're considering the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of the exponents on \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not possible because the variables are different. So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and the term \\(1\\) from the second part, but that's not correct because the second part doesn't have a constant term. Wait, let me clarify.\n\nWait, no, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanded, this will have terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but none of them will be a constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) unless the exponent is zero, which isn't the case here. So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, I'll get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from -6 to 6 in steps of 2, I think. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that the exponent on \\(c\\) has to be zero, right? Because otherwise, the term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) isn't zero, which is a different term. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That is, it's treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but we're only interested in the coefficient when \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the same as in the first part, because the second part is just a multiplier, but since it's a product, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. But that's only if we're considering the constant term in the second expansion. But the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't have a constant term. So, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term will have a different power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. But wait, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That is, it's considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of what power of \\(c\\) is attached. In that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient when \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which would mean that we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. But as I thought earlier, the second expansion doesn't have a constant term because \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) when expanded will have terms with exponents of \\(c\\) from 6 down to -6 in steps of 2, but no term with \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be zero because there's no such term. But that seems contradictory because the problem is asking for the coefficient, so maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That is, it's treating \\(a^2b^2\\) as a term on its own, and any power of \\(c\\) is acceptable. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term will have a different power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all those products, which is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients in the second part. So, as I thought earlier, the sum of coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But let me verify this because I'm a bit confused.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be zero because there's no constant term in the second expansion. But that seems unlikely because the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\). So, perhaps the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), meaning that we're summing over all possible exponents of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would indeed be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me think again. The product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded as the sum over all terms from the first expansion multiplied by all terms from the second expansion. So, each term in the product would be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^{k} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^{k}c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we're interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), which gives the coefficient from the first part as \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for each such term, we have to consider all possible \\(m\\) from the second expansion, which contributes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) and a factor of \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) times \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that would mean we're summing over all possible \\(m\\), so the total coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\), so the total coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but that seems too large. Let me check with a smaller example to see if this approach makes sense. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\(a \\times c + a \\times 1/c + b \\times c + b \\times 1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be \\(c + 1/c\\), and the coefficient of \\(b\\) would be \\(c + 1/c\\). But if I were to ask for the coefficient of \\(a\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it would be the sum of the coefficients from the second part, which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), so the coefficient would be \\(1 \\times 2 = 2\\). Similarly, for \\(b\\), it's also 2. But in reality, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which isn't a constant. So, perhaps my approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that we're considering all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, each multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. However, in the smaller example, that approach gave an incorrect result because the coefficient isn't a constant but a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would require the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero. Let me check that.\n\nIf the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we need to find terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient for \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) from the second part, which is 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. That seems more reasonable. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the second expansion doesn't have a constant term, but actually, when \\(m = 3\\), we have \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{6 - 2*3} = 20c^0\\), so yes, there is a constant term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nBut the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 * 64 = 384. But given that the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient when considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), so 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the monomial \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384 because each term in the product would have a factor of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all those coefficients across all powers of \\(c\\). \n\nBut let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). So, when I multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, giving \\(6a^2b^2c^6 + 6a^2b^2c^4 + 90a^2b^2c^2 + 120a^2b^2 + 90a^2b^2/c^2 + 36a^2b^2/c^4 + 6a^2b^2/c^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all powers of \\(c\\), would be the sum of all these coefficients, which is 6 + 6 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6. Wait, no, that's not correct because each term is already multiplied by 6. Wait, no, the coefficients are 6 times each coefficient from the second expansion. So, the coefficients are 6*1, 6*6, 6*15, 6*20, 6*15, 6*6, 6*1. So, adding those up: 6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6. Let me calculate that: 6 + 36 = 42, 42 + 90 = 132, 132 + 120 = 252, 252 + 90 = 342, 342 + 36 = 378, 378 + 6 = 384. So, that confirms that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\) is 384. \n\nBut if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. So, which one is it? The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384. \n\nWait, but in the expansion, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\), so each of those terms has a different power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all those coefficients. So, that would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a polynomial and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so it's 384. But I'm still a bit confused because in the smaller example, that approach didn't make sense. Let me try that again.\n\nIn the smaller example: \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1 = a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). If I were to find the coefficient of \\(a\\), it's \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial, not a constant. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression, it's actually a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120, as calculated earlier. \n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I'm not sure. Maybe the problem is written in such a way that it's only considering \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and ignoring \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6. But that seems unlikely because the expression includes \\(c\\). \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion, which is 6*(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6*(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps it's asking for the constant term in that coefficient polynomial, which is 6*20=120. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. \n\nI think I need to clarify this. Let me look up similar problems. Usually, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a term in a product of two expressions, it's referring to the term where the variables match exactly. So, in this case, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's considering the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. \n\nBut in the smaller example, that approach gives a coefficient that's a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because a coefficient should be a number. So, perhaps the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply that \\(c\\) is being treated as a separate variable, and the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the second expansion, which is 6*(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is this polynomial, but if the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, it's likely asking for the constant term, which is 6*20=120. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\), which is 384. \n\nI think I need to resolve this ambiguity. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" The problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's considering \\(c\\) as another variable, and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. \n\nBut in the smaller example, that approach gives a polynomial, which doesn't make sense for a coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written in such a way that it's only considering \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the \\(c\\) part is just part of the expression, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the rest of the expression is just a constant multiplier, but that doesn't seem right because the second part isn't a constant. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would mean that \\(c\\) must be raised to the zero power, so the coefficient is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 6*20=120. \n\nI think that's the correct interpretation. Because if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's likely that it's considering the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), making the entire term \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be 120. \n\nWait, but earlier I calculated that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all \\(c\\) terms is 384. So, I think the correct answer depends on the interpretation. Since the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which is 384. \n\nBut let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times something, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times that something. But the something is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's 6 times the entire sum, which is 6*64=384. \n\nBut in reality, when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(k\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120. \n\nI think I need to go with the interpretation that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so the answer is 384. \n\nWait, but let me check the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's not specifying any particular power of \\(c\\), so perhaps it's considering \\(a^2b^2\\) as a term on its own, regardless of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion is found by considering the binomial expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms with various powers of \\(c\\). The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n\n3. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each expansion:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."
