    "text": " So, does that mean I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms when looking for \\(a^2b^2\\)? Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), right? So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second expression. But since I'm only looking for the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't need to worry about the other variables, \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), because they won't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient is a scalar, and the expansion of the second part is a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that's not correct because when you multiply, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Wait, I think I'm making a mistake here. Let me clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that's not right. Because each term in the second part is a term involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by, say, \\(c^3\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^3\\), which is a different term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second expansion, but that doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think differently. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in \\((a + b)^4\\) and not in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), right? Because the second part only has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that can't be because the second expansion is a sum of terms, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial, not a scalar. I think I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), so plugging \\(c = 1\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me check that again. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because when you multiply by the entire expansion, each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of the two polynomials, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient that's the product of the coefficients from each part. But no, that's not right because the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought earlier. But let me think again. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial, but only when the variables match. Since the second polynomial has only \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), it doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term in the second polynomial, the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) remain, and the coefficient is multiplied by the coefficient from the second polynomial. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. But the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives 64. So, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest of the terms involve \\(c\\), so the coefficient remains 6. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but that would make it a polynomial, not a scalar. Wait, I'm getting confused again. Let me try to think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^{k}b^{4 - k} \\times c^{m}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) ranges from -6 to 6 in steps of 2, because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\) where \\(k\\) is from 0 to 6. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(k = 2\\) in the first expansion, which gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. Then, this term is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would involve \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0, respectively. If that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, let me re-express the problem as finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. So, now I need to find the coefficient where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). To do that, I'll first find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as before. Then, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), I get \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term we're interested in. So, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, which means \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but earlier I thought it might be 384, but that was when I considered the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, and multiplied by 6, giving 384. But now, I realize that the problem might actually be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Hmm, I'm confused because the original problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). But in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would be a polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a scalar. So, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering \\(a^2b^2\\) and ignoring the \\(c\\) terms, which would make the coefficient 6. But that seems unlikely because the expression includes both parts. So, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Let me double-check that. In \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two parts, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), giving \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) with coefficient 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the expansion of each part separately and then combining the relevant coefficients. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**  \n   Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**  \n   We need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term), which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product, so maybe I need to consider all possible combinations where the product of terms from both expansions gives \\(a^2b^2\\). But hold on, no, because the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when multiplied by \\((a + b)^4\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with the \\(c\\) terms.

But wait, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a Laurent polynomial, not a regular polynomial. So, the sum of its coefficients would be when we set \\(c = 1\\), because substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives the sum of coefficients. Let me check that. If I substitute \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64.

So, when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 multiplied by the entire second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

Wait, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, no, that's not correct either. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, each term in the second part will create a new term with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that we're only considering the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\).

Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, we're looking for all terms in the product where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and the exponents of \\(c\\) can be anything. But that doesn't make much sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would actually be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, but that would be the case if we were summing over all possible exponents of \\(c\\), but I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would include terms with \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term, it's assumed that the other variables are set to 1 or not considered. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning that we're looking for the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, so the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. Let me check that. If that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

    "text": " That means I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) because they won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, actually, that's not quite right. When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term (i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because any other term in the second expression would introduce \\(c\\) terms, which would make the overall term have \\(c\\) exponents, but the problem is only asking about \\(a^2b^2\\), not involving \\(c\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to do that. Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(c\\) equal to \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original expression: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is 6, and the constant term in the second part is 20. So, when you multiply these together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, correct. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent is zero, which occurs at \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), correct. So, multiplying these together, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. I think that's right. Wait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expansion: when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), you need the term from the first expansion where \\(a^2b^2\\) is taken, which is 6, and from the second expansion, you need the term that doesn't contribute any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which is the constant term, 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes here.

    "text": " So, does that mean that the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. When I multiply two expressions together, the coefficients multiply as well.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term would come from taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiplying it by every possible term from the second part. So, the coefficient would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not quite right because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has different powers of \\(c\\), but since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would just be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the entire expression is a product of two expansions. So, when you multiply them, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with those involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not correct because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), it's like each term in the second expansion contributes its own coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, let me think again. When you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms in the first polynomial that multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), any term in \\((a + b)^4\\) when multiplied by any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will result in a term that has both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that means that the coefficient is 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That would make more sense because then it's a single term. Alternatively, maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but that would still involve \\(c\\) terms. Wait, maybe I should re-express the problem. Let me see: The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). Because when \\(c = 1\\), each term becomes its coefficient. So, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me double-check. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is indeed 6. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be written as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The sum of all coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, when we multiply the two expansions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we would need to find the coefficient where in the second expansion, the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 times 20, which is 120. But the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so it's ambiguous whether it's considering only the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts or including the \\(c\\) terms. But in the context of such problems, usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term without mentioning other variables, it's considering the term regardless of the other variables. But in this case, since the expression is a product of two polynomials, each term in the product is a combination of terms from both. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it might actually be considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) exponents. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make more sense because then the coefficient is a single number. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20, so 6 times 20 is 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. But I'm not sure which interpretation is correct. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number. Therefore, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just considering the product and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would involve all possible \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because coefficients are numbers. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, to confirm, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when the exponent is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, so the total coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. Since the problem didn't specify the \\(c\\) term, but just asked for \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's acceptable to consider that the coefficient is 120, assuming that the \\(c\\) term is also at its constant term. Alternatively, if the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, it would be 6, but that seems unlikely because the entire expression is a product of two parts. Therefore, I think the correct answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Next, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. This happens when \\(k = 3\\), giving a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Since the question is about \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), maybe the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, but actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the terms multiply as well. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider that term separately, and the other part will just contribute a constant factor, right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when I multiply it by terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it would just multiply by the entire expansion. Wait, no, actually, that's not correct. Because when you multiply, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\), so unless we're looking for a specific term involving \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion. But that seems off because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial in \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the question is asking for a numerical coefficient. Wait, maybe I misinterpret the question. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the \\(c\\) terms can be anything, and we just want the part that multiplies \\(a^2b^2\\). In that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes a coefficient, and all those coefficients add up. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Now, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be found by setting \\(c = 1\\). Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering \\(a^2b^2\\) as a term in the entire expression, and the entire expression includes \\(c\\) terms, but the question is only about the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the second expansion is separate, so when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is just multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times each term in the second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the intended interpretation is that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, not a polynomial. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient when considering all variables, but that's unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is actually a product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is simply the coefficient from the first part times the entire second part, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which again, seems unlikely. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), which gives \\(6a^2b^2\\). Now, when you multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will be multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but then the coefficient would be a polynomial, not a number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the \\(c\\) terms are treated separately. In that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be \\(6\\) times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, let's compute that. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as before. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be found using the binomial theorem. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 * 20 = 120\\). Wait, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), it just said the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the intended answer is 384, but maybe the problem expects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, not a polynomial. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's not a number, so that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is mistyped, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^3\\), for example, but that's just speculation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the \\(c\\) terms can be anything, so the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial, but that's not a number. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me try to clarify. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part times each term from the second expansion, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is usually a number, so perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient when considering all variables, but that's not possible unless we fix the exponents of \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire second expansion, so the coefficient is 6 times the second expansion, but that would be a polynomial, not a number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply expecting the coefficient from the first part, 6, because the second part is multiplied by all terms, but that seems unlikely. Wait, maybe I should consider that the entire expression is a product, so when you expand it, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by each term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient would then be a polynomial, not a number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering only the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. That seems plausible. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure which interpretation is correct. Let me see if I can find any clues in the problem statement. The problem is written as: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any mention of \\(c\\). Therefore, perhaps the intended interpretation is that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient when considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion, but that would be a polynomial, not a number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is mistyped, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^{10}\\) or something similar, but that's just speculation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply expecting the coefficient from the first part, 6, because the second part is multiplied by all terms, but that seems incorrect because the second part is an expansion that includes multiple terms. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that's a polynomial, not a number. Hmm, this is confusing. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all variables. So, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems odd because the problem is asking for a coefficient, not a polynomial. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. That seems more plausible because it results in a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure. Wait, perhaps I can look at the degrees. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is of degree 4 in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is of degree 6 in \\(c\\). So, when multiplied together, the entire expression is a product of these two, so each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for a coefficient, perhaps it's expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire second expansion, but that's a polynomial, not a number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is mistyped, and it's supposed to be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^3\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120, but that's just a guess. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply expecting the coefficient from the first part, 6, because the second part is multiplied by all terms, but that seems incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient is a polynomial, but that's not a number. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is 120, considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. I'm not sure, but perhaps the problem is expecting 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting 120. Let me check both possibilities. If I consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. If I consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, it's 6 * 64 = 384. But which one is correct? The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is a polynomial in \\(c\\), specifically 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, perhaps it's expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would be 6 * 20 = 120. But since the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), perhaps it's expecting 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient is a polynomial, but that's not a number. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a separate factor, so the coefficient remains 6. But that seems incorrect because the second part is an expansion, so when you multiply, the coefficients multiply as well. Wait, no, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, I think the correct answer is 384. But I'm still a bit unsure because the problem is a bit ambiguous. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120. But given that the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think the intended answer is 384. So, to summarize, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, we consider the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64 when \\(c = 1\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " So, does that mean I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms at all? Hmm, maybe not. Wait, actually, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so when we expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps we can ignore the \\(c\\) terms because they don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me think. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it will just add some coefficient multiplied by that \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those terms, you'd have to sum all those products. But wait, no, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the product would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like it would make the coefficient a sum, which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a single number. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me clarify: the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\text{term from } (a + b)^4 \\times \\text{term from } \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would be 6 times the sum of coefficients, which is 6 times \\(2^6\\) because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has coefficients that are binomial coefficients, and the sum of coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 would be 384. But that seems high. Wait, no, actually, that would be the case if we were collecting all the coefficients, but perhaps the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a single number, not a polynomial. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps they are treating \\(c\\) as another variable, and they want the coefficient of the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right because coefficients are usually constants. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering all possible terms and just wants the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would give a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", implying a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Wait, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so that would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that \\(c\\) is independent, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be 6*(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the constant term in \\(c\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, so \\(c^0\\). Let me check that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is from 6 down to -6, decreasing by 2 each time. The constant term is when the exponent is 0. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent is 0 when 6 - 2k = 0, which is when k = 3. So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without mentioning \\(c\\), so perhaps it's considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, making the coefficient a polynomial. But that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion, which would be 6*(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is only interested in the term where \\(c\\) is raised to a specific power, but since it's not specified, I think the answer is 384. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me check my reasoning again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which expands to a sum of terms with coefficients. So, when you multiply 6 by each of those terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times each of those coefficients. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is not a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), i.e., the term where \\(c^0\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure which interpretation is correct. Let me see if there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion, which would be 6*(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6). But that's a polynomial, not a single coefficient. Therefore, I think the intended answer is 120, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\). So, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\), is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the sum of coefficients is 64, so 6*64=384. But now I'm thinking it's 6*20=120. Which one is correct? Let me clarify the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Since the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, since the question asks for the coefficient, which is typically a numerical value, I think the problem is expecting the coefficient when considering all possible terms, which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct answer. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. But since the problem doesn't specify \\(c\\), I think it's 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we have \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe I should think differently. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), it becomes \\(6 \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\right)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is this entire polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps they are considering the constant term, which is 120. Alternatively, perhaps they just want the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is irrelevant. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both expressions multiplied together. Therefore, I think the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), making the coefficient a polynomial. But since the problem asks for the coefficient, perhaps they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still confused because when you multiply two expressions, each term in one is multiplied by each term in the other. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times each coefficient from the \\(c\\) expansion. So, the coefficient is not a single number but a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's 6 times the entire expansion, which is 6*(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6). But that doesn't make sense as a coefficient because coefficients are constants. Therefore, I think the intended answer is 120, the coefficient when considering the constant term in \\(c\\). So, I'll go with 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\), is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

Alternatively, if there are other terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), their coefficients would multiply with the coefficients from \\((a + b)^4\\), but since we're only interested in the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) remains as is, any \\(c\\) terms would have to cancel out, meaning we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, let me think: in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).

Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, is that correct? Let me check again. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a constant term of 20. So when you multiply them, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times 1 (from the constant term) would be 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. Alternatively, if I didn't consider the constant term and just multiplied by the entire expansion, but I think since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), any terms involving \\(c\\) would have to multiply with terms in the other expansion that would affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents, but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), the only way that happens is if the \\(c\\) terms multiply by the constant term. So, yeah, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.

Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply as well, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), their coefficients won't be affected by the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(c^0\\) is 1, and that would contribute the necessary factor to the coefficient. Wait, let me think about that again. When you multiply two terms, the variables and their exponents add. So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and some term from the second part, I want the variables from the second part to not affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, I need the second part to contribute a term that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), which in this case is just 1. But since the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which only involves \\(c\\), I can just consider the constant term in that expansion. So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me find that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).

Alternatively, maybe I should consider the entire expansion. Let me think: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply when the variables don't interfere. So, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the first part, and the second part contributes a constant term, their product would just be 6 * 20 * \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient is indeed 120.

But that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which should be a numerical coefficient, not involving \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to see how many times \\(a^2b^2\\) appears when considering the multiplication. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expression, the resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means we're only looking at the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are exactly 2, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that can't be right because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) should only be 6 if we're considering the entire expression as a product, but I think I'm mixing up the variables. Let me clarify: the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. So, each term in the second part will have a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) (for various \\(k\\)) will be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients from the second part multiplied by 6. Wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a single term, but when multiplied by the second expression, it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. But the sum of all coefficients in the second expression is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will come from the first part, and it will be multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that would mean we need the term in the second part that is a constant term, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because only then, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it will result in a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\), and the coefficient will be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, I think I was wrong earlier. The correct approach is to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6. So, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).

So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me double-check. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part with coefficient 6, and the constant term from the second part is 20, so when multiplied, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense. Alternatively, if I think about the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but only the constant term would result in \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms.

Wait, actually, no. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression multiplies each term from the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider how it interacts with the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But hold on, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all. So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the result will be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\).

Because when you multiply the two, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term from the second part, resulting in \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant.

Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me double-check that.

    "text": " So, I think that the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part might not affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because it's multiplied by other terms involving \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not right. When you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not involving \\(c\\), maybe the \\(c\\) terms will just carry along as coefficients. Wait, but actually, \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are variables, so when you multiply, you might get terms with \\(c^m\\) and \\(1/c^m\\), but since the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the coefficient would include all the possible terms from the second expansion, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\). Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand both parts, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and terms from the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that means we're looking for all the terms in the product where the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts are \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, because each term in the second expansion will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as in the first part, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion isn't a single term. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the \\(c\\) terms are just part of the coefficient, but since they aren't part of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can just take the coefficient from the first part and multiply it by the sum of all terms from the second part. Wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the second expansion is a separate term. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Wait, but no, because each term in the second expansion is a term in \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by, say, \\(c^3\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^3\\), which is a different term. So, the only term in the product that is exactly \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion, if there is one. So, maybe I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part. That makes more sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term in the second part. So, let me work on that. First, as I found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the constant term, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Let me just double-check that. So, the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\), coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Second part: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), constant term is 20. Multiply them together: 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations. So, the answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, using the binomial theorem. Next, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product as \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " So, maybe I don't need to expand the entire expression, just the parts that affect \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think. When I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can ignore the terms involving \\(c\\) because they won't affect the exponent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but wait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients add when combining like terms. Wait, no, actually, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire expression, which includes both \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, I think I'm misunderstanding. The problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, in the expanded form of the entire expression, how many times does \\(a^2b^2\\) appear, considering all possible combinations with the \\(c\\) terms. But that seems a bit confusing. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is the middle term when \\(k = 3\\), because \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient there is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, so which is it? Is the coefficient 384 or 120? Let me think again. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\), so the sum of all coefficients is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But on the other hand, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then maybe it's just 6 multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has different powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. However, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, then perhaps it's 6, but that seems unlikely because the expression includes \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which in the entire expression would include all possible coefficients from the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, each occurrence of \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But earlier I thought that the constant term is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. I'm confused now. Let me try to clarify. When you have a product of two polynomials, say \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\), the coefficient of a specific term in \\(P(a, b)\\), say \\(a^2b^2\\), is equal to the coefficient of that term in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the entire polynomial \\(Q(c)\\). So, if you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64, so the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me verify this with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1 = (a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The expansion would be \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1, and the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\) is 2, so the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2, which is correct because in the expansion, \\(a\\) appears as \\(ac\\) and \\(a/c\\), so the coefficients are 1 and 1, summing to 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would be 1 * 2 = 2. So, that seems to check out. Therefore, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but earlier I thought that the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, so maybe I was confusing the constant term with the sum of coefficients. Let me confirm: the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) evaluated at \\(c = 1\\) is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), which is correct. The constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20, but the sum of all coefficients is 64. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, it's 6 * 64 = 384. However, if I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which in the context of the entire expression would include all possible powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 384. But wait, that seems too large. Let me check with a smaller exponent to see if this makes sense. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion is \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be 1 * (1 + 1) = 2, which is correct because \\(a^2c\\) and \\(a^2/c\\) each have coefficient 1. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2 * (1 + 1) = 4, and the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) would be 1 * 2 = 2. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 2, which is indeed 1 (coefficient in \\((a + b)^2\\)) times 2 (sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\)). So, applying the same logic, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, I think the answer is 384. But wait, let me check another way. Let's consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. That seems correct. Alternatively, if I were to expand the entire expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), meaning that each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Evaluating \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) at \\(c = 1\\) gives 64, so the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{384}"

So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and the second part will contribute all its terms. But wait, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think I don't need to consider the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\).

So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but each of those will have different powers of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will actually be present multiple times, each multiplied by a different power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that might not be the case. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but in the product, each term will be of the form \\(a^k b^{4 - k} c^m\\) or something like that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by various \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first expansion. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients add up only when the variables match. But in this case, the variables are different. So, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are separate from the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps the coefficient is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present, and its coefficient will be the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, as I found earlier, and the coefficient of each term in the second part is the binomial coefficients times the appropriate powers of \\(c\\). But since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be, because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all the terms. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Hmm, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). That is, the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That would make more sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, perhaps I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would involve multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part by the \\(c^0\\) term from the second part. So, the coefficient would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That seems plausible. Let me check that. So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Then, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is needed. Let me compute that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the answer should be 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", not \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, maybe I was wrong earlier. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But in that case, the coefficient would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would depend on \\(c\\). So, I think that's the correct approach. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. Let me just verify this again. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two parts, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, giving a coefficient of 120 for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, I think that's correct.

So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that seems a bit complicated. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what happens with \\(c\\), perhaps the answer is simply 6, because the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Let me check that again. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, for example, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), 1, \\(1/c^2\\), etc. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, that makes sense because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) contributes a coefficient, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of those coefficients will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all terms is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, first, I need to find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in understanding the problem. Wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). So, actually, in the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which includes terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 6 times 64, giving 384. Hmm, but that seems like a lot. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I don't need to consider the entire expansion. Since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the coefficient is just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate variables and don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, it will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which has a coefficient. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, so 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, but that's not specified. The problem just says \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the answer would be 384. Wait, but let me confirm. Let me think about a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion would be \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), and the coefficient of \\(b\\) is also \\(c + 1/c\\). So, if I were to ask for the coefficient of \\(a\\), it would be \\(c + 1/c\\), which when evaluated at \\(c = 1\\) is 2. But in reality, the coefficient is variable-dependent. Wait, but in the original problem, we're not evaluating at any specific value; we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the answer is just 6 because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misapplying the concept. Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power. In that case, I would need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times that constant term. So, let's see: the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) go from 6 down to -6, decreasing by 2 each time. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem just says \\(a^2b^2\\), so it's ambiguous whether it's asking for any power of \\(c\\) or specifically \\(c^0\\). If it's any power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient is 384. If it's specifically \\(c^0\\), then it's 120. Hmm, but in the original problem statement, it's written as \\(a^2b^2\\), without any mention of \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the answer would be 384. Wait, but in that case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have all the coefficients from the \\(c\\) terms attached to it, which seems a bit odd. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is unusual. So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. That seems more reasonable. So, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's not specifying anything about \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean that \\(c\\) can be any power? Or is it implicitly looking for the term where \\(c\\) is zero? Hmm, but \\(c\\) can't be zero because there's a \\(1/c\\) term. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, giving 384. But that seems like a very large coefficient. Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), in which case it's 120. I'm a bit confused. Let me think about how the multiplication works. When I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), etc. Then, when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which expands to terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), \\(1/c^6\\). So, when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, I get \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(120a^2b^2\\), \\(90a^2b^2/c^2\\), \\(36a^2b^2/c^4\\), \\(6a^2b^2/c^6\\). So, in the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) appears only once, multiplied by 120, from the constant term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. But wait, in that case, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the expanded form would be the sum of all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But in reality, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a separate term, and when you multiply by the second expansion, each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all terms would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. So, that would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems contradictory because when you look at the expanded form, the only term with \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is 120. So, I think the confusion arises from whether the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\) or specifically \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). If it's regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 384. If it's specifically \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. But the problem statement just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(c\\) is zero. Therefore, the answer is 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^4\\), but no, the original problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, given that, I think the intended answer is 120, as that's the coefficient when \\(c\\) is zero. Therefore, I think the correct coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we consider the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. This term is found using the binomial theorem: the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero occurs when \\(k = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these results gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " So, maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Hmm, let me think about that. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but actually, no, that's not quite right. Wait, no, because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Wait, actually, no, because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it's a separate variable, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, not a product. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Oh, wait, so the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. But \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so when you multiply them, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are numerical, not expressions involving variables. So, I must have made a mistake here. Maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all terms, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's just the coefficient from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, which is 6, and then multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that still doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not quite right either because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you're getting terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). But that's not how coefficients work. Wait, no, because in the product, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider all possible ways that \\(a^2b^2\\) can be formed, which would be by taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and any term from the second part. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be \\(6\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But again, that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number. I'm getting confused here. Maybe I should approach it differently. Let me consider that the entire expression is a product of two separate polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and one in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables don't interfere with each other. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is not a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but only considering the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present. But in that case, the coefficient would be \\(6\\) times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right either because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you're getting terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). But that's not how coefficients work because each term has a different power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean we're considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, each multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), and we're just summing their coefficients. But that's not standard. Typically, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term, like \\(a^2b^2\\), in a product, you're supposed to consider all the terms that result in \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by the other polynomial. But in this case, since the other polynomial is in \\(c\\), which doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression. I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look at it another way. Let me consider the entire product: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, you'll have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{6 - m}\\), which simplifies to \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{m - (6 - m)} = a^kb^{4 - k}c^{2m - 6}\\). So, each term in the product will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{2m - 6}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need to find all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\) in the first part. So, for \\(k = 2\\), the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), as I calculated earlier. Now, for each \\(m\\) from 0 to 6, the term will be \\(a^2b^2c^{2m - 6}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so we need to consider all possible exponents of \\(c\\) attached to \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but the problem doesn't specify any particular exponent of \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean we need to sum over all possible \\(m\\), each multiplied by their respective coefficients? Or is the problem asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) term, meaning that we need to consider all possible \\(c\\) exponents and sum their coefficients? That seems a bit unclear. Let me think. If the problem had said \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)\", that would mean we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0 = 1\\). But since it just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", perhaps it's considering all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from each term \\(a^2b^2c^{2m - 6}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that's not standard because usually, you specify the term you want, including all variables. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), is just another factor that doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but only considering the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me calculate that. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, if I take 6 and multiply it by 64, I get 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 384. But wait, is that correct? Let me think again. When you set \\(c = 1\\), you're summing all the coefficients of the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I do that, then multiplying by the coefficient 6 from the first part gives me 6 * 64 = 384. But does that make sense? Because in the product, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of all coefficients from the second part multiplied by 6. So, that would be 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second part) = 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. Let me double-check. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64 because when \\(c = 1\\), \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the answer should be 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a numerical factor, not a polynomial. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Wait, perhaps the question is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of the entire expression, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems odd because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem, and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire product, but only the numerical coefficient, not involving \\(c\\). Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a number. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is just the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\). Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's considering all terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would indeed be the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. But that seems complicated. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion will be multiplied by 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a number. Hmm, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because usually, coefficients are numerical, not expressions. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the part of the product where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, maybe I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6. Let me try that approach. First, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) times 20 (from the constant term in the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, that makes sense because when you multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term from the second part, giving \\(a^2b^2 \\times 20\\), and since the coefficient from the first part is 6, the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Does that mean I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms? Hmm, maybe not, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) when the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the part involving \\(c\\) doesn't affect it. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, every term in the first expression gets multiplied by every term in the second expression. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the first expression, and the second expression involves \\(c\\), which doesn't interact with \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as the coefficient in the first expression, because the second expression's terms only contribute to the \\(c\\) part, not the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts. Wait, that might not be correct. Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the entire expression is a product of two polynomials. So, when I expand this product, each term will be a product of a term from the first polynomial and a term from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is another polynomial, so when you multiply it by 6, you get 6 times that polynomial, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's not correct because the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is just a scalar multiple, not a variable term. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me clarify: the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, that would require me to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term, and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part. Let me check that. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then yes, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and multiply it by 6. Alternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. So, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6. Let me proceed with that approach.\n\nFirst, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, this expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. Therefore, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", not specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, does that mean I'm supposed to consider all possible powers of \\(c\\)? But that would mean the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are supposed to be numerical. So, perhaps the problem is implicitly asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, if it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial. But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a number. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs at \\(k = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't consider the \\(c\\) terms, and just thought that the coefficient is 6, that would be wrong because the problem is a product of two expressions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be 6 times the entire second expression, but that's not a number. Therefore, the correct approach is to find the constant term in the second expression and multiply it by 6, giving 120.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The exponent of \\(c\\) is zero when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\n   \\]\n   The constant term is 20.\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."
