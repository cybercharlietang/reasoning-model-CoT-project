So, I think 120 is the correct coefficient. Let me try another approach to confirm. Alternatively, I can consider the entire expansion of both polynomials and see if the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is indeed 120. So, the first polynomial is \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me write out a few terms of its expansion: \\(c^6 + 6c^5 \\times (1/c) + 15c^4 \\times (1/c)^2 + 20c^3 \\times (1/c)^3 + 15c^2 \\times (1/c)^4 + 6c \\times (1/c)^5 + (1/c)^6\\). Simplifying each term: \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). So, the constant term is 20, as I found earlier. Now, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, giving terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20\\), \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 15/c^2\\), and so on. But we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That's the term \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 120a^2b^2\\). So, that confirms it. The coefficient is indeed 120. I don't think I'm missing anything here because any other term from the second polynomial would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) term, which would make the overall term have \\(c\\) in it, not just \\(a^2b^2\\).
