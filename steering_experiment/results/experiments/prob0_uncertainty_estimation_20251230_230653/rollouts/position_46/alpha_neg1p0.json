Therefore, the only contribution comes from the constant term in the second polynomial. So, I think my calculation is correct. The coefficient is 120. Wait, just to make sure, let me think again. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\). The other polynomial, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has a term \\(20c^0\\). So, when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by \\(20c^0\\), you get \\(120a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(120a^2b^2\\). So, yes, that's the term we're looking for. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120. I don't think I made any mistakes here. The key was realizing that only the constant term in the second polynomial would contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product, because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) component, which we don't want. So, by calculating the coefficients separately and then multiplying them, I arrived at the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.
