    "text": " So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), I just need the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and then, since the \\(c\\) terms are separate, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times whatever the sum is from the \\(c\\) terms. But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply the two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But in this case, since the first part is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and the second is in \\(c\\), the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply by each term in the second part, it's like scaling the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by each of those coefficients. But wait, that might not be correct. Let me think again. The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which expands to terms involving \\(c^k\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from -6 to 6 in steps of 2, I think. But when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would only appear when multiplied by the constant term in the second polynomial, which is the term where \\(c^0\\), right? Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is a different term unless \\(k=0\\). So, the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's calculate that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. The coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found earlier, and the constant term from the second part is 20. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we need to find how many times \\(a^2b^2\\) appears when we multiply by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but actually, no. Because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a term in \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, does that mean we're supposed to treat the entire \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) as a scalar multiple when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Or do we need to consider something else? Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand this, each term in the expansion will be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), it will create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) can be various exponents. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, does that mean we just take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)? But that can't be right because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a scalar. Wait, maybe the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, perhaps we need to consider all the terms where the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) and some \\(c\\) term occurs. But no, the question is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which usually means the coefficient when all other variables are treated as coefficients. So, perhaps the answer is simply 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that seems odd because the coefficient would then be a polynomial, not a single number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression as a single polynomial, meaning that we have to consider the product of the two expansions. But in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by some coefficient, and when you sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms, you get the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would then involve \\(c\\) terms, which is not a constant. Alternatively, perhaps the question is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem didn't specify, so maybe I need to check the original problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the answer is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in that expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion, which is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems too involved, and I don't think that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients, which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that might not be correct because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), so 6 times 64 is 384. But I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. But that's not what's written. The problem just says \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering the entire expression as a product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem didn't specify any particular term involving \\(c\\), so maybe the answer is simply 6 times the expansion, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the terms where the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, meaning that the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so that the term is just a constant. So, perhaps we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That seems plausible. Let me check that. So, if that's the case, then first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply those two coefficients together. So, let's do that. First, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, multiplying the two coefficients together: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times 20 (from \\(c^0\\)) equals 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. But wait, the original problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without mentioning \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is considering that \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems odd because the question is probably expecting a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that doesn't seem right because the sum of coefficients is when you set \\(c = 1\\), which would give the total sum as \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 times 64 is 384. But I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that each term in the expansion would have a part from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and a part from \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms multiplied by 6. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem to be what the problem is asking. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, which is 6, and then the rest is separate. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m / c^n\\), but more accurately, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to look at all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering all such terms, meaning that the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is not a single number, so perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient when considering \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But again, that's a polynomial, not a number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems too involved. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then the rest is separate. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me check the original problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the answer is simply 6, because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would still be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems to be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is not a single number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. But that seems high. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 20, which is 120. That seems plausible. So, perhaps the answer is 120. Let me confirm that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. So, that's probably the answer. Alternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion, but that's a polynomial, so 120 seems more likely. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

Wait, that might not be correct. Let me think again. When you have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^5\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\).

But wait, that can't be right because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would then be multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. But that's not how it works. Actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, since the two polynomials are in different variables, \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), the coefficients in one don't affect the coefficients in the other. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a single number, not a polynomial. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but considering all possible terms, including the \\(c\\) terms. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second polynomial, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because each term in the second polynomial is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, let me check that. The sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 (from the first part) times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. Is that correct? Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in one polynomial is multiplied by each term in the other polynomial. So, in this case, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which includes all the \\(c\\) terms. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all those multiplied terms. So, actually, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that includes \\(c\\) to some power. Wait, no, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the answer is simply 6, because the \\(c\\) part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) part. But that can't be right because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients. Wait, no, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will have coefficients multiplied by each term from the \\(c\\) polynomial. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all the products where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the \\(c\\) polynomial, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me check with a smaller example to see if that makes sense. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion is \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) in this product is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is not a constant. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term. Wait, but in the original problem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term from the \\(c\\) polynomial, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the question is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. In that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the entire product. That would require considering both expansions and finding the term where the exponents add up to \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, let me try that approach. So, first, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Now, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) would give us the term we're interested in. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the middle term when the exponent is 0. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That happens when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 times 20, which equals 120. So, the final answer should be 120. Wait, but earlier I thought it might be 384, but that was when I considered the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) polynomial, which would be incorrect because the problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, I think 120 is the correct answer. Let me double-check my steps. First, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. Then, expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20. Multiply them together: 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. So, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20.

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me confirm that. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) expanded as \\(6a^2b^2 + \\text{other terms}\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expanded as \\(T_0 + T_1c + T_2c^2 + \\dots + T_6c^6\\), where \\(T_0\\) is the constant term, then when I multiply them together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will only come from \\(6a^2b^2 \\times T_0\\), because any other term would have a \\(c\\) component, which we don't want. So, yes, I think that's correct. So, first, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). How do I find that? Again, using the binomial theorem. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term: \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\): \\(6 = 2k\\) => \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, when multiplying the two polynomials, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term 20, giving a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, I can think about the entire expansion. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial and the constant term in the second polynomial. Since there are no other terms in the first polynomial that would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without involving \\(c\\), this is the only contribution. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's it. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2.

But that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that seems a bit off. Let me think again. Wait, no. Because when you have two separate polynomials multiplied together, like \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the product will have terms where each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and when you multiply it by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(6a^2b^2 \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\), etc. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would mean that we're only looking for the terms where the \\(c\\) part is \\(c^0\\), right? Because if you have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^k\\), it would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\) unless \\(k = 0\\). So, in fact, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the \\(a + b\\) part) multiplied by 20 (from the \\(c + 1/c\\) part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the idea is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since one polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and the other is in \\(c\\), the only way to get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) is if the other factor is a constant term, which is the term with \\(c^0\\). So, yes, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120. Let me just check my steps again to be sure. First, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, expanding \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when the exponent on \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.

But that seems off because the product would have terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term will be of the form \\(a^k b^m c^n\\) where \\(k + m\\) is 4 for the first part, and \\(n\\) is determined by the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Then, the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a separate polynomial. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not right either. Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a term like \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). So, the coefficient for each of these terms would be 6 times the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, that means we're looking for all the terms where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) are specific to each power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by each term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a constant, not a polynomial. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Perhaps the question is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so that the coefficient would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that's not what the question says. It just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the sum of all coefficients in that expansion. Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is only 6, because the other part is in terms of \\(c\\), and the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a single number. But the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which suggests a single coefficient, not a polynomial. So, maybe I'm supposed to treat \\(c\\) as a constant and just find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. Since the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\), as I thought earlier. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me try another approach. Let me consider the entire product. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I expand each part separately, the first part has terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), etc., and the second part has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^5 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c} = c^4\\), and so on, down to \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when I multiply these together, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., up to \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a single coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. As I calculated earlier, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384. But wait, let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. That is, the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the 0 power. So, that would be the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me check that. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). We set the exponent equal to 0: \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) \u2192 \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term from the second part, then the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, which interpretation is correct? If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 * 64 = 384. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, the problem statement is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's considering \\(c\\) as another variable, and the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because coefficients are usually constants. Alternatively, maybe it's considering that the coefficient is in the entire expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, that would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial. But that seems odd because the question is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a number. So, perhaps the intended interpretation is that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, if it's looking for the coefficient when considering all variables, including \\(c\\), then it's 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me check with the constant term approach. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, meaning \\(c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. I think the more likely intended answer is 120, because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial, which doesn't make much sense in this context. So, perhaps I should go with 120. Let me verify that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. Therefore, when you multiply these together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, giving a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120 for the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 120. Alternatively, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), then it's 384. But given the way the problem is phrased, I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), which would be 384. But I'm still a bit confused. Let me think about it differently. If I consider the entire product, \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of the coefficients of all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second polynomial. So, that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct answer. But to be thorough, let me also consider the constant term approach. The constant term in the second polynomial is 20, so if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem didn't specify the \\(c\\) term, so I think the intended answer is 384. Therefore, after all this thinking, I believe the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. The entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is considered, and the sum of its coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in 64. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term (which is \\(c^0\\)), you get \\(a^2b^2\\), and if you multiply it by any other term involving \\(c\\), you'd get terms like \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), which aren't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, first, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which means \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, multiplying the two coefficients together: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times 20 (from \\(c^0\\)) gives 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Let me just double-check that. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is indeed 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed 20 because when \\(k = 3\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{6 - 6} = 20c^0\\). So, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. Yeah, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

Wait, no, that's not exactly right. Because when you multiply the two polynomials, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), it's the product of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and the term \\(1\\) (the constant term) from the second polynomial, because that's the only way to get a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\).

Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem: \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from both parts: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, is that right? Let me double-check. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20.

Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Oh, I see. So, the expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\).

So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems odd because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a constant. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be \\(6\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too large. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the part of the product that results in \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient would still be 6 times the entire expansion. Wait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make much sense either. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term would have a coefficient, and the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of all those coefficients. But actually, no, because each term in the second polynomial is separate. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, is that correct? Because when you set \\(c = 1\\), you're essentially summing all the coefficients of the \\(c\\) terms. So, if you have \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\), and you set \\(c = 1\\), you get \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's just expecting the coefficient in the context of the product, which is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because coefficients are usually constants. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me try another approach. Let's consider the entire expression: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term will be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), which we've determined has a coefficient of 6. Then, this term is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times each coefficient from the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is typically a constant. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression, but since the expression includes \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), but that seems unclear. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems to be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which might not be what the problem is asking for. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but since it's not specified, I'm confused. Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the \\(c\\) polynomial, the coefficient for each term would be the coefficient from the \\(c\\) part multiplied by 6. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by evaluating the polynomial at \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, that would be the answer. But let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the \\(c\\) polynomial, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.

So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to do that. Again, I can use the binomial theorem for this. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of 6 and 20, which is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives a coefficient of 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives a coefficient of 20 for \\(c^0\\). When you multiply these two parts together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will multiply the constant term from the second part, resulting in \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) times \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, the coefficient is 120. I think that makes sense. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The key was recognizing that when multiplying two polynomials, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial by the constant term in the second polynomial. Since the second polynomial has a constant term, which is 20, multiplying it by 6 gives 120. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations. So, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by multiplying the binomial coefficients from each part of the expression. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) to find the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3.

Wait, that doesn't sound right. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since the two polynomials are in different variables, \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), the terms don't interfere with each other. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that term would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, that seems high. Let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that only comes from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, and when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the product will be a combination of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, effectively scaling it by the sum of the coefficients. So, as I thought earlier, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. But let me think again: is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Yes, because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term that's entirely in one polynomial is multiplied by the sum of coefficients of the other polynomial. For example, if you have \\((a + b)(c + d)\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 times the sum of coefficients in \\(c + d\\), which is 2, so the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product is 2. Similarly, here, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the sum of coefficients in the other polynomial is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the entire expansion and see if there's any interaction between the variables, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), their exponents don't affect each other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach it differently. Let's consider the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, each of those terms contributes a factor, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is when we set \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that's the correct approach.

Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me think again. Since the two polynomials are separate, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\), the product of the two will have terms that are products of terms from each. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). So, actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are multiplied by all the terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial is found by substituting 1 for all variables. So, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, is that correct? Let me check. So, when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the other polynomial. Because each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by every term in the second. So, yes, if I'm only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, its coefficient in the first part is 6, and since every term in the second polynomial is multiplied by this, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second polynomial. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and then the entire second part is just a scalar multiple when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but no, because the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part is in \\(c\\), the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2 \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, that's not exactly right. Because the entire expansion of the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, you get terms that are \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply that we are considering terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, i.e., terms where \\(c\\) cancels out. Wait, that's a different approach. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because \\(c^0\\) would be the constant term, and that's the only term that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) would give a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, let's calculate that. First, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find this, I can use the binomial theorem again. Let me write \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 384. Now I'm getting 120. Which one is correct? Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will only appear when multiplied by the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, you'd have a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), you need to multiply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, that would be 6 * 20 = 120. So, the correct answer should be 120, not 384. I think I made a mistake earlier when I thought the sum of coefficients was 64. Because the sum of coefficients is when you set \\(c = 1\\), which gives 64, but that's the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. But in reality, we only want the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120 is the correct coefficient. Let me verify this another way. Suppose I consider the entire expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, the term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these, you get 6 * 20 = 120. So, yes, that makes sense. Alternatively, if I thought that the coefficient was 6 times the entire expansion, that would be 6 * 64 = 384, but that would be the case if I were considering all possible terms, including those with \\(c\\) involved. But since the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), I need to find the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, which is the constant term, 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120 is correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be found by considering each part separately and then combining the results.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\).

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because each term in the product would have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\).

So, the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me check my reasoning again. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by each coefficient in the second polynomial, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we're to treat \\(c\\) as another variable and find the coefficient of the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\).

Hmm, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a sum over all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that seems complicated.

But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. I'm confused. Let me try to approach it differently. Let's think about the entire product: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two expressions, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part comes from \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). Then, this is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem didn't specify that. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, so the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Let me assume that. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. That would mean I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, let's proceed under that assumption. Therefore, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), as before, gives a coefficient of 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\). Now, the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. Because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), I get \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term we're interested in. So, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the constant term, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120.

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps I'm supposed to treat \\(c\\) as another variable and find the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That is, the term would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. That would make sense because then we're looking for a specific term in the product. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but it's written as \\(a^2b^2\\), implying that \\(c\\) is being ignored or that it's a separate part. Wait, but the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so when you multiply them, the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all separate. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be part of the product, but multiplied by terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems a bit off because the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any term in \\(c\\), so the coefficient would actually be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the 0 power, which is essentially the constant term in the \\(c\\) expansion. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), I would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, let's go with that interpretation. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). We already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.

Wait, no, that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\).

Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that the entire product is a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). But in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems odd. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the coefficient. So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6, as found from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part is just multiplied as a whole, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains 6. But that seems too simple, and the problem wouldn't ask for just 6 if it's part of a product with another binomial. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to approach it differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need to find all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, which means we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and the corresponding term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). Now, when we multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the entire coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. I must be misunderstanding something. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps I'm supposed to consider the coefficient as a numerical factor, but that doesn't account for the \\(c\\) terms. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is not a numerical coefficient. So, maybe the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, but that would mean the coefficient is a sum involving \\(c\\) terms, which seems unusual. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms.

But that seems odd because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a number, not an expression. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, so the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, is that correct? Let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Then, when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the product will be 6 times each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives 64, then 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. But let me verify this approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that the product is a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, each term in the product is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\).

Wait, that's the same as 6 times the sum of binomial coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 2^6, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. So, that seems consistent. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as 6, and the rest is just part of the expression, but that doesn't seem right because the problem specifically asks for the coefficient in the entire product. So, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, giving 384.

So, perhaps I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) that gives \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me check that logic. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the product will be of the form (term from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by (term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, to get a term that's only \\(a^2b^2\\), the term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) must be a constant term, i.e., a term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains \\(a^2b^2\\).

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\).

So, first, let's confirm the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) which we found to be 6. Now, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponents cancel out (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) occurs at \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, yeah, that seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"
