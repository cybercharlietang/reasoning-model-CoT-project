    "text": " But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps I can treat the second part as a single term when considering the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. When you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then maybe the coefficient is just the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, that doesn't sound right because the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so each term in the second part will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, leading to terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. Wait, no, actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first polynomial, and the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the second polynomial is not a constant. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all the terms, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right either because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term would have a different power of \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the same as 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting the variable to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by any term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that can't be right because the problem expects a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. But the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In other words, it's the sum of all coefficients of terms where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is raised to any power. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, as I calculated earlier. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient is 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion, but that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense. Therefore, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, giving 384. So, the final answer is 384. Wait, but let me double-check that. Another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the first polynomial has terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second has terms in \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is independent of \\(c\\), so when you multiply it by each term in the second polynomial, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the second polynomial is not a constant. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. In that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, that would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Now, what is the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)? Let's find that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the answer is 120. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 384. Now I'm getting 120. Which one is correct? Let me think carefully. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. So, which interpretation is correct? The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\). In algebra, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term in a product of polynomials, it's usually implied that you consider all possible powers of the other variables. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, it would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. However, in the second interpretation, where we're looking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), the coefficient is 120. I need to figure out which one is correct based on the problem statement. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Since \\(c\\) is another variable, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) could be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would include all terms where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, if the problem had specified a specific power of \\(c\\), like \\(c^0\\), then it would be 120. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's asking for the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), so 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in one polynomial is multiplied by all terms in the other polynomial. So, if you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that's not possible because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. In that case, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. So, maybe the correct answer is 120. I think I confused myself earlier by considering the sum of coefficients, but actually, the problem is asking for a specific term where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared, and \\(c\\) is also squared or something, but no, it's not specified. Wait, the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, so the coefficient is 6 times each coefficient in the second polynomial, but that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Let me confirm this by considering an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1 = (a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). If I expand this, I get \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). Now, if I look for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^1\\), it's 1. If I look for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it would be the sum of coefficients for \\(a c\\) and \\(a/c\\), which is 1 + 1 = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^0\\) would be 0 because there's no such term. Wait, but in this example, the coefficient of \\(a^1\\) regardless of \\(c\\) is 2, which is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^1\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^1\\) is 1 (from \\((a + b)^1\\)) multiplied by the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\), which is 2, giving 2. So, by analogy, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, giving 384. Therefore, I think the correct answer is 384. Wait, but in my earlier example, the coefficient of \\(a^1\\) regardless of \\(c\\) is 2, which is correct. So, applying the same logic, in the original problem, it should be 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

But that seems a bit odd because the second expansion is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). Wait, but if I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then I can treat the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part as a scalar multiple because when you multiply it by \\(a^2b^2\\), it will just scale the coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that can't be right because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a sum of terms, each involving different powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think is just a number, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because otherwise, the coefficient would involve \\(c\\) terms. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient in the expansion without considering the \\(c\\) terms, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That is, when you multiply out the entire expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems unusual. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, so that the coefficient is a constant. That would make more sense. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. Let me assume that's the case.\n\nSo, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), I need to consider both expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). From the first expansion, as I found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, from the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. Because when I multiply 6 by that term, it will give me the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term, resulting in \\(a^2b^2c^0\\).\n\nSo, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\) => \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is the product of the coefficients from each expansion. That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term). So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, correct. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), correct. So, when you multiply these two, you get 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. But the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so maybe it's considering the entire expression, including the \\(c\\) terms, but I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient when considering all variables, so \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense for a coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be the sum of all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems odd because coefficients are usually constants, not expressions in variables. So, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's considering the entire expression, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, which would indeed be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical answer. So, perhaps the intended interpretation is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unusual. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, so the coefficient would be the sum of all possible products where \\(a^2b^2\\) is formed, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would again involve \\(c\\) terms.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering that \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be treated as a scalar when considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that doesn't make sense because \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is not a scalar; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\).\n\nWait, maybe the problem is intended to be interpreted as finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiplying those two coefficients together. That would give 6 * 20 = 120. So, that's probably the intended answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared and \\(c\\) is to the zero power, which would be 120.\n\nSo, to sum up, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be \\(6(c + 1/c)^6\\). But that's not a numerical coefficient, so I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.

It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems odd. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so we just take the 6 from the first part and multiply it by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, but that would be treating the second part as a constant, which isn't correct. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the constant term in \\(c\\). That would make more sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6. Let me work that out. First, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\); it just asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I was overcomplicating it. Let me re-examine the problem. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} c^m\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges based on the second expansion. But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only dependent on \\(k=2\\) in the first part, as we found earlier. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). So, as I calculated earlier, that would be 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that it's 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number, which seems unlikely. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), but since the problem didn't specify, perhaps it's just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6. Wait, but that seems too simple. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would require considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is not a number. Therefore, I think the correct approach is to consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), so 6 times 20, which is 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the final coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when we multiply these together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, giving a total coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. Let me check if there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, maybe I can consider the entire expansion and see if any other terms could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). But since the second polynomial only contributes a constant term to the product, I don't think so. If I took any other term from the second polynomial, like \\(c^1\\) or \\(c^{-1}\\), then when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would result in a term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the constant term from the second polynomial contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.

Because when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the \\(c\\) expansion. So, each term in the \\(c\\) expansion has a coefficient, and when multiplied by 6, adds to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and since the \\(c\\) terms are multiplied by 1 (because we're just considering the coefficient part), then the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I should expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem and see what the sum of its coefficients is. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The sum of the coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\), which matches what I thought earlier. So, the sum is indeed 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I should think of the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, and the second part's coefficients are summed because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, it's 6 times 64. So, I think that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Thus, the final coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{384}\n\\]"

Wait, but that seems a bit confusing. Let me think again. The sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of the coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part is in \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the respective terms in each polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second part, since the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, yes, that would make the coefficient 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me think differently. Suppose I expand both parts separately. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), has terms up to \\(a^4b^0\\) and \\(a^0b^4\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), has terms involving \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when I multiply them, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each of these \\(c\\) terms. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6*64=384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is more straightforward. Since the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is simply 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that seems odd because the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so when you multiply by it, you get multiple terms. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) power, it's as if we're summing all the coefficients from the second part and multiplying by 6. So, the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, so 6*64=384. Alternatively, maybe I should compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then note that the second part is multiplied by this, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But since the second polynomial has multiple terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times each coefficient in the second polynomial, but since we're looking for the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), it's 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6*64=384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest is about \\(c\\), but that can't be because the entire expression is multiplied by the second part, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 384. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the entire product as a product of two polynomials, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, 6 * 64 = 384. That seems to make sense. Alternatively, maybe I should compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\), but since the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's the sum over all \\(k\\) of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, that would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 384. So, I think the answer is 384. Wait, but let me check with another approach. Let me compute \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) separately and see what happens. The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Now, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be found using the binomial theorem as well. It would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the terms are \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20c^0\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). The sum of the coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6*64=384.

But that doesn't seem right either.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me try to break it down. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's first compute \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) separately, then multiply them together. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).

So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expanded is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\).

Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, I need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the term where \\(k = 3\\) will be the constant term. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Since these two terms are multiplied together, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, when I expand \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it must be multiplied by a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), i.e., the constant term. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed the product of the coefficients from each part. So, 6 times 20 is 120. I think that's correct. Wait, but let me check my steps again. First, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. That seems right because \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient there is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. Yes, that makes sense. So, I think the coefficient is 120. I don't think I missed anything because I considered both parts separately and then multiplied their coefficients.

That makes sense because when you multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part would multiply each term of the second part, and only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero would contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the overall product.

Wait, is that correct? Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply it by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\).

Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, you need to sum all the coefficients from the second polynomial and multiply by the coefficient from the first part. Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me think again. When you have two polynomials, say \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), then the product \\(P(a, b) \\cdot Q(c)\\) will have terms where each term of \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term of \\(Q\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). Because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(\\text{Coeff}_{a^2b^2} P \\times \\text{Coeff}_{c^0} Q\\), but wait, no, because \\(Q(c)\\) includes terms with positive and negative exponents. Wait, no, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\), because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times \\text{Sum of coefficients in } Q(c)\\). So, I need to find the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). How do I do that? Well, the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, in this case, set \\(c = 1\\). Then, \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but let me verify this because sometimes when dealing with negative exponents, the sum of coefficients isn't just plugging in 1. Wait, no, actually, when you set \\(c = 1\\), you do get the sum of the coefficients because each term becomes its coefficient times \\(1^k\\) or \\(1^{-k}\\), which is just 1. So, yes, the sum is indeed 64. So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) being multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of coefficients in the other polynomial. So, that's 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, perhaps I can approach it differently. Let's consider the entire expansion: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, so when multiplied by the second part, it becomes \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, so 384. That seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can think about it as the coefficient being 6 multiplied by the entire expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the other terms would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64.

But the question is asking only for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) part. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), but since \\(c\\) is another variable, perhaps the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, no, that can't be right because the two parts are being multiplied together. Let me think again. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) is a polynomial in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\). When you multiply them together, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is just asking for a numerical coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the product. That would make sense. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, to find this, I can consider that the coefficient will be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply the two polynomials, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will multiply each term in the second polynomial, and the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero will contribute to the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, let me calculate that. First, as I found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the term where the exponent is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6 and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. Wait, but let me double-check that I didn't make a mistake. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them gives 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of the entire product as \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanding, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by 20 will give \\(a^2b^2 \\times 20\\), which is the term we're interested in.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think that the coefficient would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that might not be correct because each term in the second expansion has different powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms where the \\(c\\) part is any power, but since we're looking for just \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe we need to consider the entire second polynomial's expansion and see how it affects the coefficient. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term will have a different power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that can't be right because the second expansion is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you're effectively creating terms with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), each with their own coefficients. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean we're looking for the coefficient when the powers of \\(c\\) are zero, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the term without any \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you'll get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only include the term where \\(k = 0\\), because that's the only term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, making it just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by the coefficient from the first part, which is 6. So, let me try that approach. First, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do this, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20. So, when you multiply these two terms together, you get \\(6 \\times 20 \\times a^2b^2c^0 = 120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. But wait, let me double-check. Another way to think about it is that the entire expression is the product of two expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's not correct because the sum of all coefficients would be when you set \\(c = 1\\), but here we're specifically looking for the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, yes, the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion and multiply it by the coefficient from the first expansion. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in each part and then multiplying them. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Wait, that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you'd have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in that expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, is that correct? Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when I multiply them together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 6c^4\\), etc., all the way down to \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 1\\). But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present multiplied by every possible power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient for each of these terms would be 6 times the corresponding coefficient from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But if we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) part, that would mean we're summing over all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in that expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, how do I find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)? The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me check this again because I might be making a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the rest of the terms involve \\(c\\), maybe we can treat the entire \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) as a single term when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But let me think differently. Maybe the problem is intended to have us consider only the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because otherwise, the coefficient would involve powers of \\(c\\), but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's assuming that we take the constant term as well. Wait, that might make more sense. Let me check. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), then in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought before. But wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all terms, regardless of the \\(c\\) part. So, that would indeed be 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to have us find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the 0 power, which would be the constant term. Let me check that approach. So, first, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6, as before. Then, expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and find the constant term, which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let's do that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when we multiply these two parts together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering only the constant term in the \\(c\\) part, is 120. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 384. So, which is correct? I think I'm getting confused here. Let me clarify the problem statement again. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Now, in this product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., down to \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 1\\). Therefore, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), multiplied by 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384. However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), then we need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, as calculated earlier. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every possible power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. If I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c), and I multiply them, then each term in P(a, b) is multiplied by each term in Q(c). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q(c). Because each term in Q(c) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * (sum of coefficients in Q(c)). The sum of coefficients in Q(c) is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we need to find the term where \\(c\\) is zero, which is 6 * 20 = 120. But since the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384. But I'm a bit confused because sometimes when variables are involved, people might be looking for the constant term. Let me check both approaches. First approach: Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). So, 6 * sum of coefficients in Q(c) = 6 * 64 = 384. Second approach: Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, which one is correct? Let me think about how the problem is phrased. It says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". So, in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. Therefore, the correct answer is 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have us consider only the constant term in \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 120. Let me see if there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the entire expression is a product of two independent polynomials, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That would give 6 * 20 = 120. So, perhaps that's the intended interpretation. But I'm not entirely certain. Let me check the problem again. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)?\" So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) times 6. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct approach. Alternatively, if the problem had specified that \\(c\\) is to be eliminated or something, then we would take the constant term. But as it stands, I think the answer is 384.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm this with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1 = (a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\), which is 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 2. But if I expand it, I get \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is indeed 2, which is the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial times the coefficient from the first. Similarly, if I look for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^0\\), that would be 1 times the constant term in \\((c + 1/c)\\), which is 0 because there's no constant term. Wait, that's not right. Wait, \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\), so the constant term is zero. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) times the constant term would be zero. But in the expansion, the term \\(a\\) is multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, but the coefficient of \\(a c^0\\) is zero. So, depending on what we're looking for, the answer changes. Therefore, in the original problem, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's 384. If we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120. But the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384. Therefore, I think the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with the binomial expansion again. Let's compute \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) separately and then see how the coefficients multiply.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\): as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\): The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for each exponent \\(6 - 2k\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first will be multiplied by each term in the second, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum over all \\(k\\) of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\), because each term contributes \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\) to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that coefficient is the sum of all these contributions, which is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). The sum of the binomial coefficients \\(\\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k}\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nAlternatively, if we were looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), we would set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\). But since the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe the problem is intended to have us consider only the constant term in \\(c\\). Because otherwise, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a sum over all powers of \\(c\\), which might not make sense in the context. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have us find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. But the problem doesn't specify, so I'm a bit confused.\n\nWait, let me check online or think about similar problems. Usually, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a term involving multiple variables, and the expression is a product of two polynomials, each in different variables, then the coefficient of the term in one set of variables is the sum of the products of the coefficients from each polynomial. So, in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one polynomial and \\(c\\) is in another, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, I think 384 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have us consider that \\(c\\) is a separate variable, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), regardless of \\(c\\). But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you're introducing coefficients that affect the overall expression.\n\nWait, no. Actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, if I have \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\), then each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). Because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributing to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\) is 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, I think that's correct. So, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

If I have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then each term in the expansion is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term from the second part, which are terms like \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would actually just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), making the coefficients add up. Wait, no, that can't be right. Because the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of those terms becomes \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would require that the \\(c\\) terms are zero, i.e., the constant term in the second expansion. Because if there's any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) term, then the term would have \\(c\\) in it, and thus wouldn't just be \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) in the second part. Because only the constant term in the second expansion would multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) to give a term without \\(c\\), i.e., \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on that. To find the constant term, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from both parts, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the constant term from the second part is 20. So, when you multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient of \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). That seems right. Alternatively, if I think about the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, but wait, no, because the second expansion isn't a polynomial in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), it's in \\(c\\). So, the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) is to multiply by the constant term. So, yes, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**  \n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**  \n   The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which happens at \\(k = 3\\).  \n   Its coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**  \n   The overall coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

    "text": " However, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will come from the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by, say, a term with \\(c\\), it would result in a term like \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), but since we're looking for just \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (i.e., the constant term) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that makes sense. Therefore, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents: \\(c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that's \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when you multiply these two, 6 * 20 is indeed 120. So, yeah, that seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes here.
