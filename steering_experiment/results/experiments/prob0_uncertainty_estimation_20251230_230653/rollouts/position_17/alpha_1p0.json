    "text": " Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion will be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the question is only about \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't matter because any term involving \\(c\\) won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, no, that's not right. Because when you multiply, you have to consider all the terms, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which will contribute a coefficient that's multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not correct either because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that can't be right because the variables are different. Let me think again. So, the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponent for \\(c\\), that's \\(c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need to find all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs. That means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so that part is fixed. Now, for each such term, the coefficient will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) multiplied by \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but it's not specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, does that mean we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), or do we need to consider the entire expression? Hmm, I think the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is separate from \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all separate variables, the coefficient would just be the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me try to clarify. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term is a product of a term from each expansion. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you're effectively scaling the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by the sum of all coefficients in that expansion. But wait, is that correct? Let me think. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). Then, the product P(a, b) * Q(c) would have terms where each term of P is multiplied by each term of Q. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q(c). Because for each term in Q(c), you're adding a multiple of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, what is the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, setting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct because I thought the problem was only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but I'm including all the terms from the \\(c\\) part. Let me check again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). But the coefficient is just the numerical factor in front of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, each term in the product that has \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient that's the product of the coefficients from each part. But since the \\(c\\) part can have different exponents, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, yes, that would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me think differently. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. But the problem only mentions \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think it's safe to assume that we're considering the coefficient regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But let me double-check this approach. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in each part. But wait, that's not correct because \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) are separate, so when you multiply them, the coefficients don't directly multiply unless you're considering specific terms. Wait, no, actually, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). Now, when you multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you get \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, if I were to expand the entire product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would appear in each multiplication, scaled by the coefficients from the \\(c\\) terms. So, yes, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me check if the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64. To find the sum of coefficients, set \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Yes, that's correct. So, the sum is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, I'm a bit confused because I thought the problem might be asking for a specific power of \\(c\\), but it's not. So, I think this approach is correct. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in each part, but that's not the case because the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part. So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficients for \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times whatever the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(c^0\\) is 1, which is the constant term. Wait, is that correct? Let me think. When I multiply the two expansions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will multiply each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm looking for a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\), and no \\(c\\) terms, that means I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so that when I multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, I need the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, let me find that constant term. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which means \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), I get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 20, which equals 120. Wait, but hold on a second. Is that correct? Let me double-check. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives me \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. Then, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a constant term of 20. So, when I multiply these two together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I should think about the entire product. Let me write it out. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I expand both, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and is multiplied by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expansion as a product of two separate expansions and how the terms combine. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, their exponents don't interfere with each other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the product of the coefficients from each expansion. So, yeah, 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's the answer. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), that's correct. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in the expansion, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, setting \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), we get \\(m = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, that's correct. Then, multiplying 6 * 20 gives 120. So, yeah, I think that's right.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, maybe I should consider the entire product and see if there's any other way that \\(a^2b^2\\) could come up, but I don't think so because the other expansion only affects \\(c\\) terms, and we're only looking for the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, I think my approach is correct.\n\nSo, in summary, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\).

So, maybe the coefficient is just 6 times whatever coefficient comes from the \\(c\\) terms when multiplied by 1, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) in it. Wait, no, actually, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\((a + b)^4\\), and then multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from \\((a + b)^4\\), when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means I'm looking for the term where the \\(c\\) parts multiply to give \\(c^0\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a constant with respect to \\(c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in one is multiplied by each term in the other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But no, that can't be right because the variables are different; \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). So, actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

But wait, that doesn't make sense because the product would have terms involving both \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's not exactly correct either. Let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial, but only when the variables match in a way that their exponents add up to the desired term. In this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply, the \\(c^0\\) term from the second polynomial will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial, resulting in \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that makes sense. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's compute that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(6 = 2m\\) \u2192 \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the one with \\(c^0\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when we multiply the two expressions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (since it's multiplied by \\(c^0\\)) would be 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think the answer is 120. Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which is \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I made a mistake here.

So, that would mean that I need to find all the terms in the expansion where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion, and then sum their coefficients. But wait, that would mean the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion would have a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would contribute that coefficient times 6 to the term \\(a^2b^2\\) times whatever power of \\(c\\). But wait, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in effect, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).

But wait, no, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term's coefficient would add up. So, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded has terms with various powers of \\(c\\), but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would result in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. So, yes, that would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Since the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64, as I calculated earlier, then 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the second expansion's terms don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), because they are multiplied by \\(c\\) terms. But no, when you have a product of two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term's coefficient contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times that term's power of \\(c\\). So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all terms is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0, respectively. If that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be the constant term in the second expansion. So, in that case, I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the original problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying \\(c\\). So, I'm a bit confused. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient to the term \\(a^2b^2\\) times that power of \\(c\\). So, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. As I calculated earlier, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Alternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would be 120, but I think that's not the case here. So, I think the answer is 384. Let me just confirm that. The first part gives 6, the second part's sum of coefficients is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.

Hmm, maybe I should just consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times the coefficient of the constant term (with respect to \\(c\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply by 1 (from the constant term), you don't change the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Alternatively, if there are other terms, they would involve \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps we can just take the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems like overcomplicating. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. But in this case, we're looking for a specific term in the product.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't seem correct because the coefficients in the second expression depend on the powers of \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each factor. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in \\((a + b)^4\\), and in the second expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), there are terms with various powers of \\(c\\). So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, I would need to take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would give me a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps I can consider that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the coefficients in the second expression aren't constants; they depend on the powers of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each factor. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first factor, and the second factor has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first factor times the sum of all coefficients in the second factor. Wait, that might be it. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expression, each term contributes to a different term in the product, but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. But how do I find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expression is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check that again. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\), which is the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient in the first part times the sum of coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part contributes to multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, 6 times 64 is indeed 384. But wait, is that correct? Because actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each coefficient in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the total coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients in the second part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part. So, yes, 6 times 64 is 384. But let me think again: is that the correct approach? Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that seems like it would result in a term that's \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would have coefficients for various powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the answer is indeed 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expression, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating and the answer is just 6, but that doesn't seem right because the second expression is also being multiplied. Wait, no, because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients combine. So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficient is just 6, but that seems too simple. Let me try another approach. Let's think of the entire product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product comes from taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and any term from the second part. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part contributes a coefficient that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is when we set \\(c = 1\\), which gives 2^6 = 64. So, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check this again. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, the other part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that. The expansion would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in this expansion has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) and a power of \\(c\\) as \\(6 - 2k\\). Now, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it creates terms like \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the total coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. The sum of coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The entire expression also includes \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and the sum of its coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives the coefficient as \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

So, that means that the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But that seems high. Wait, let me think again. When you have two separate variables, the coefficients in the product would involve the product of the coefficients from each part. But in this case, the first part's coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a separate expansion.

But that seems odd. Wait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is just the constant term. So, in that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6. That makes sense because then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. So, let's try that approach. First, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", and I interpreted that as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). But maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient. So, I think my initial approach is correct: find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product, which is 120.\n\nWait, but to confirm, let's think about the entire expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, each term in the product will be of the form \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from -6 to 6 in steps of 2. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible \\(c^k\\) terms. But that can't be, because that would mean the coefficient is a sum over all \\(k\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too high, and I don't think that's what the problem is asking for. It's more likely that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's not a numerical coefficient. So, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Let's consider the entire expansion. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6a^2b^2. Then, this is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a sum of terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that contradicts my earlier result of 120. So, now I'm confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify: when the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's considering all possible terms in the product, so each term would be of the form \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), and the coefficient for each such term is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any restriction on \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which isn't a single number. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^4\\) or something else, but as it stands, I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, let me check my calculations again. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, to get \\(c^0\\), we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, that's correct. Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, I think that's correct. So, the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which occurs when \\(k = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together, we get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

Wait, no, that can't be right because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, maybe the answer is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) be 6 times 64, which is 384? Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem might not be asking for the sum of coefficients, but rather the coefficient in the entire expansion, which includes all the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have multiple variables, you might have to consider specific terms, but in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when considered as a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient is 6 times each term's coefficient. But actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), meaning that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every possible term from the second expansion. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), perhaps the answer is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I thought earlier, the sum of coefficients is found by plugging \\(c = 1\\), which gives 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not 100% sure. Let me try another approach. Maybe I should consider that the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) as 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, and then it's multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms from the second expansion. So, the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient, not the entire expression, maybe it's sufficient to say that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and not considering the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient would be 6 times whatever is in the second part. Wait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the entire expansion in terms of \\(c\\), but if the problem is only interested in the coefficient as a numerical factor, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the other variables. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Let me verify that. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in terms where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared, maybe the part with \\(c\\) doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, perhaps I can treat \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as a separate factor and just take its entire expansion, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the \\(c\\) terms just add a factor that is multiplied by 6.

But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), that means we need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) would still be \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Let me check that. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Let's solve for \\(m\\): \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) \u2192 \\(2m = 6\\) \u2192 \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will have a coefficient of \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, so that's the final answer? Let me just make sure I didn't miss anything. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. When you multiply these two, 6 times 20 is 120, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Yeah, that makes sense. I don't think I made any mistakes here. I considered each part separately, found the necessary coefficients, and multiplied them together.

But wait, no, that might not be necessary. Alternatively, maybe the entire expression is a product, so when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be multiplied by every term in the second expansion.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because each term in the second expansion is a power of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms would just be coefficients for the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not correct. Actually, each term in the product will be a combination of terms from each expansion. So, if I'm looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just the term from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but is that accurate? Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the terms in each polynomial that combine to form that specific term. So, in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), every term in the second expansion will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, what's the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? To find the sum of coefficients, we can set \\(c = 1\\), because substituting \\(c = 1\\) into the expression gives the sum of the coefficients. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but is that correct? Let me verify. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But since the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), when we multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term in the second expansion will be a coefficient multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. As I calculated before, substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives 64, so 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but I feel like that's not considering something. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of two separate expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) because to get \\(c^0\\), we need to choose 3 terms of \\(c\\) and 3 terms of \\(1/c\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Wait, so if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider that in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only term in the second expansion that would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is the constant term, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20. So, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So, which is correct? Let me clarify. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Now, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the question is, do we care about the exponent of \\(c\\) in the final product? The problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, but no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply it by terms in the second expansion, each term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would contribute a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But wait, this contradicts my earlier thought where I considered only the constant term. So, which is correct? Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term from the second expansion, each of which is a different power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes to a different term in the product with \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but I'm confused because earlier I thought that only the constant term would contribute. Let me check that. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). And \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when I multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, each term would be \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. So, my initial thought was correct. The earlier confusion was because I thought only the constant term would contribute, but actually, since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), all terms in the second expansion contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the correct coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, since the entire second factor \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) contributes a sum of coefficients equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\) when \\(c = 1\\), the overall coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of coefficients would be \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6\\) times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, yes, that would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the product, and any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would just contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) part. So, in that case, the coefficient would be \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 64, so 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Wait, but let me think again. Is that correct? Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all the terms in the other polynomial, but in this case, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is indeed the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, that would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of the two expansions, so each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by every term in the second part, each contributing their own coefficient. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try a different approach. Let's consider that the entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), which gives us \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for each such term, the exponent of \\(c\\) will be \\(6 - 2m\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the sum over all possible \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Wait, but that's the same as the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is indeed \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Hmm, that seems consistent with my earlier thought. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and the answer is indeed 384. Let me check if that makes sense. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the problem differently. Since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6 in the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, which is 64, so 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Yeah, that seems right. So, I think the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is that the entire expression is a product of two independent polynomials. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, that's 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think about generating functions. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient in the first polynomial times the sum of coefficients in the second, which is correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c), then the coefficient of a certain term in P(a, b) times Q(c) would be the coefficient in P(a, b) times the sum of coefficients in Q(c). Because when you multiply, each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q, so the coefficient of a specific term in P is multiplied by all terms in Q, hence the sum of coefficients in Q.\n\nSo, in this case, P(a, b) is \\((a + b)^4\\), and Q(c) is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) is 6, and the sum of coefficients in Q(c) is 64, so the coefficient in the product is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because in the problem, it's \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a Laurent polynomial, but when we talk about the sum of coefficients, we set all variables to 1, so \\(c = 1\\), so it becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product being 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit unsure. Let me try a smaller example to see if this approach works. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Let's compute this product. \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1 = c + 1/c\\). So, the product is \\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\). So, expanding, that's \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). Now, if I look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in this product, there are no \\(a^2b^2\\) terms because the highest power of \\(b\\) is 2, but in the product, each term is either \\(a^2\\), \\(ab\\), or \\(b^2\\), multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term because that would require both \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) in the same term, but in the product, each term is either \\(a^2\\), \\(ab\\), or \\(b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c\\) terms. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no such term. But according to my earlier approach, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^2\\) is 1 (since \\(\\dbinom{2}{2} = 1\\)), and the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\) is \\((1 + 1) = 2\\). So, 1 \u00d7 2 = 2, but in reality, the coefficient is zero. So, that suggests that my approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, that's a problem. So, in the small example, my method gives 2, but the actual coefficient is zero. So, that means my earlier approach is wrong. So, I must have made a mistake in reasoning.\n\nHmm, so where did I go wrong? Let me think again. The mistake must be in assuming that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial. But in the small example, that approach failed because the product didn't have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, but the approach suggested it should have a coefficient of 2. So, clearly, that approach is incorrect.\n\nSo, perhaps I need a different approach. Let me think again.\n\nWait, in the small example, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the product is \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). So, there are terms like \\(a^2c\\), \\(a^2/c\\), \\(2ab c\\), etc., but no \\(a^2b^2\\) terms because each term in \\((a + b)^2\\) is multiplied by each term in \\((c + 1/c)\\), so you can't get a term where both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared because in \\((a + b)^2\\), the terms are \\(a^2\\), \\(2ab\\), and \\(b^2\\). So, when you multiply by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), you just get terms like \\(a^2c\\), \\(a^2/c\\), \\(2abc\\), etc., but no \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is zero. So, my initial approach was wrong because it didn't account for the fact that you can't have both \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) in the same term when multiplied by the second polynomial.\n\nSo, in the original problem, \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first polynomial, and it's multiplied by the entire second polynomial. So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first polynomial, 6, multiplied by the entire second polynomial, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But when we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. But in the small example, that approach didn't work because the second polynomial's sum of coefficients was 2, but the actual coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) was zero. So, that suggests that my approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the concept. Let me think differently. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum over all possible exponents of \\(c\\) of the products of coefficients from each polynomial. So, in other words, for each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\), the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), which has a coefficient of 6, the total contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for each \\(k\\). So, the total coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\). So, that would give 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But in the small example, that approach gave a wrong result. So, why is that?\n\nWait, in the small example, the product didn't have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term because you can't get \\(a^2b^2\\) by multiplying \\(a^2\\), \\(ab\\), or \\(b^2\\) by terms involving \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient is zero. But according to the approach, it would be 1 \u00d7 2 = 2, which is wrong. So, the approach is only valid if the term exists in the product.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that in the original problem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in \\((a + b)^4\\), but in the small example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present in \\((a + b)^2\\), so when you multiply by the second polynomial, you can't get \\(a^2b^2\\) because there's no such term in the first place. So, in the original problem, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in \\((a + b)^4\\), when you multiply by the second polynomial, you will have terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 384.\n\nBut in the small example, since \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present in the first polynomial, the coefficient remains zero, regardless of the second polynomial. So, perhaps the approach works only when the term exists in the first polynomial. So, in the original problem, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, the coefficient would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating again. Let me try another approach. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, because \\(c^0\\) would mean that the term doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would give a term with \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\), and that's the term we're interested in. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, let me calculate the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, that's different from my earlier answer of 384. So, which one is correct? Let me check.\n\nIn the small example, if I apply this new approach, I would set \\((a + b)^2\\) and look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\). But in \\((a + b)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because that term doesn't exist. So, the coefficient would be zero, which is correct. So, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, so the total coefficient is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but that was based on an incorrect approach. So, this approach seems more accurate because it correctly handles the small example. So, I think the correct answer is 120.\n\nLet me verify this again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. Now, when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), to get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to multiply by the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), which is 20. So, the total coefficient is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, to confirm, let's consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the term where the exponent is zero is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by this term, you get \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2 = 120 a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nTherefore, my initial approach was incorrect because I didn't consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) must be multiplied by the \\(c^0\\) term to result in \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the correct coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in the first polynomial, and when multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, it results in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But that contradicts the earlier result of 120. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the concepts of coefficients in the product. Let me clarify: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all terms in the product where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that each term in the first polynomial (which includes \\(a^2b^2\\)) is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, and all those products contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nBut in the small example, this approach would give 1 \u00d7 2 = 2, but the actual coefficient is zero because \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present in the first polynomial. So, in the original problem, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in the first polynomial, the coefficient would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) must be multiplied by \\(c^0\\) to get \\(a^2b^2\\), but that's not the case. The product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by the coefficient from the first polynomial. So, that would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems to contradict the earlier approach where I considered only the \\(c^0\\) term. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. But since it's asking for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's 384.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because in the product, each term is a combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would include all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, for example, \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., each have coefficients, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all these coefficients.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the coefficient of a term in a polynomial is the sum of the coefficients of all monomials that are equal to that term. So, if you have \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., each of these are different terms because their exponents of \\(c\\) are different, so their coefficients don't add up. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would only include terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present without any \\(c\\) terms, i.e., \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but that contradicts the earlier reasoning. So, perhaps the confusion is about what exactly is being asked. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". In the context of polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term refers to the coefficient when all variables are present. So, for example, in the product, \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is a term, \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is another term, etc. So, each of these is a distinct term, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would only refer to the coefficient of the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present without any \\(c\\) terms, i.e., \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, in that case, the coefficient is 120.\n\nBut wait, perhaps in the problem, the variables are considered as separate, so when they ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), they mean the coefficient regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by the coefficient from the first polynomial, which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nThis is confusing. Let me try to clarify. In polynomial terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would only refer to the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because if you have a term like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), that's a different term than \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of \\(c\\), meaning that we're considering \\(c\\) as part of the term, then the coefficient would be 120. If it had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), then it would be 384. But in standard polynomial terminology, the coefficient of a specific term like \\(a^2b^2\\) would refer to the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present without any other variables, i.e., \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, the correct coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but in the original problem statement, it's written as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\", which suggests that \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the product, and we're to find its coefficient, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1 = (a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). Expanding, we get \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). Now, in this product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't exist because each term is either \\(a^2\\), \\(ab\\), or \\(b^2\\) multiplied by a power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero. So, in this case, the coefficient is zero because \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present.\n\nIn the original problem, \\((a + b)^4\\) does have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), it will produce terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all powers of \\(c\\), would be the sum of all these coefficients. But in standard polynomial terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would only refer to the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present without any \\(c\\) terms, i.e., \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as separate variables, and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), meaning that any term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), would contribute to the coefficient. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems inconsistent with the small example, where the coefficient should be zero, but according to this approach, it would be 1 \u00d7 2 = 2, which is incorrect.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering \\(c\\) as part of the term. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, so 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), I need to multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not correct either. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term will have a power of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients combine. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply by each term, you're effectively scaling the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by each coefficient from the second expression. So, if I can find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then I can multiply that by 6 to get the final coefficient. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two coefficients, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents for \\(c\\), that's \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term becomes \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, that's fixed. So, for \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, the other part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) times \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, that means we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), so we need to find the term where \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so that the \\(c\\) terms cancel out. Solving \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, so that's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product? Let me check that again. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (since \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) when \\(m = 3\\)) is 20. So, when you multiply these two, you get 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the coefficients from each part. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that contributes to the constant term is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that makes sense.

So, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\).

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). That gives 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, is that right? Let me double-check. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when you multiply these two parts together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's correct.

So, when you multiply these two, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term in \\((a + b)^4\\), that term will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not exactly right because the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) are multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But actually, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) times 64 (the sum of coefficients from the other part), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), meaning that the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, so maybe I'm supposed to treat it as a single term. Hmm, I'm getting confused. Let me try a different approach. Let me first expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I already did as 6. Now, the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\). Now, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) has a coefficient of 6, and when multiplied by each term in the other expansion, it will create terms like \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the other expansion contributes its own coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64, as I thought earlier, because setting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. But let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's effectively treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable and just considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) powers. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems odd because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's just 6 times the entire expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. When you have two expressions multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. But in this case, since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would indeed be 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so I think it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything here. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second part, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\). So, when I multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but only the term with \\(c^0\\) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), because any other term would have a power of \\(c\\), making it \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or similar, which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, yes, I think my approach is correct. So, the coefficient is indeed \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Let me just double-check my calculations. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), that's correct. For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), correct. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by considering the expansion of each part separately and then multiplying the relevant coefficients. \n\n1. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2.

But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider that term separately and see how it interacts with the other expansion. Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I just need to find the term in \\((a + b)^4\\) that's \\(a^2b^2\\), which we found has a coefficient of 6, and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but the entire expression includes \\(c\\) terms. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Is the problem asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), or is it asking for the coefficient when considering all variables together? Hmm, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so I think it's only concerned with the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts, and the \\(c\\) terms can be anything. So, in that case, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient, so maybe I'm supposed to consider the entire expression and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 multiplied by the sum over all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a specific term in the other expansion. Wait, no, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) are not all the same. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try a different approach. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. Hmm, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms, but maybe I'm missing something. Wait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). Because otherwise, the coefficient would involve \\(c\\) terms, which doesn't make much sense for a coefficient. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. That would make more sense. So, let me try that approach. So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Now, the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, I want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because I'm looking for \\(c^0\\). So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, that's 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. Wait, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe I'm supposed to consider all possible terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's expecting a numerical coefficient, which would imply that \\(c\\) must also be raised to the zero power, so that the term is just a constant. So, I think my approach is correct, and the coefficient is 120. Let me double-check. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiplying them together gives 6 * 20 = 120.

But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the part with \\(c\\) doesn't affect that coefficient. Wait, no, that can't be right. Because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) would be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, no, that's not quite right either. Because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't sound right because the variables are different. So, actually, the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\), so when you multiply, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be multiplied by each term in the other expansion, but since \\(c\\) is a separate variable, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which doesn't make sense because coefficients are numbers, not expressions. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand the product, each term will be of the form \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), does that mean we just take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Or do we need to consider the coefficients of specific terms in the second expansion? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me try to clarify. When you have two expressions multiplied together, say \\(A \\times B\\), where \\(A\\) is a polynomial in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(B\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), then the coefficient of a specific term in \\(A\\), like \\(a^2b^2\\), when multiplied by \\(B\\), will result in \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in \\(B\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\(A \\times B\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) multiplied by the entire sum of the coefficients in \\(B\\), because each term in \\(B\\) contributes a coefficient that gets multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, that might not be accurate. Let me think with an example. Suppose \\(A = a^2b^2\\) and \\(B = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\). Then, \\(A \\times B = a^2b^2(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6})\\). So, each term in \\(B\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) (which is 1) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(B\\). But wait, in this case, \\(A\\) is just \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient is 1. But in our problem, \\(A = (a + b)^4\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. So, when we multiply by \\(B = \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(B\\) evaluated at \\(c = 1\\) is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times 64, which is 384? But that seems too straightforward. Let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^l c^m\\), and we're only interested in the terms where \\(k = 2\\) and \\(l = 2\\), regardless of \\(m\\). So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) contributes a coefficient that multiplies \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, that would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, is that correct? Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the answer is just 6, but that seems too simple. Alternatively, maybe I need to consider that the entire product is a combined expression, and I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But then, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, so 384. Let me verify that by expanding \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for each term \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). The sum of all coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), which matches what I thought earlier. So, the sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times 64, which is 384. So, I think that's the answer. But let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all the terms in the other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion gets multiplied by 6. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient (the numerical factor), it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, so 384. Yeah, that seems right. So, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). When multiplied by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of all coefficients in the latter is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Thus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the coefficients from the \\(c\\) terms multiplied by 6. Wait, but that can't be, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it would become \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that seems like it would create multiple terms with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests that maybe they're considering \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that might not make sense because the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, so each term would have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents and \\(c\\) exponents. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). Because if you don't specify the \\(c\\) part, it's ambiguous. Wait, but the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so maybe it's just considering the part from \\((a + b)^4\\) and ignoring the \\(c\\) terms, but that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is the product. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, regardless of the other part. But that seems unlikely because the other part is also given. Hmm, maybe I should consider that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Wait, maybe I'm supposed to treat \\(c\\) as a separate variable and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial. Hmm, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering that the other part doesn't affect it. But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term (which is \\(c^0\\)), you get \\(a^2b^2\\), and that's the only term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, I think that's the right approach. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, then find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and multiply them together. So, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the answer should be 120. Wait, but let me double-check. When I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Then, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, when I multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But only the constant term in the second expansion will result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\), because the other terms would have \\(c\\) raised to some power. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times 20, which is 120. Yeah, that makes sense. So, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will just be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term will be multiplied by the constant term (the term independent of \\(c\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to find that. Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The exponent of \\(c\\) here is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original expression: \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the product of these two coefficients, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me double-check that. So, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only consider the constant term in the second expression. So, yes, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120. So, I think that's the answer. But just to make sure, let me go through it again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying them gives 120. So, the coefficient is 120. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the constant term is 20.\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."
