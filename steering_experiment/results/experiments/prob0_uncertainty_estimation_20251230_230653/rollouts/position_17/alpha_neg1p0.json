    "text": " Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by all the terms involving \\(c\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can consider that term separately, and the rest of the expression involving \\(c\\) will just be coefficients for that term. Wait, but actually, no, because the entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can take the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) which is 6, and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms from the \\(c\\) expansion as coefficients. But that seems too broad. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, you get a product where each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need to find all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2. That happens when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as I found earlier. So, for each such term, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), but we also have to consider the exponent of \\(c\\). But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, but that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product, so \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). But perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times whatever power of \\(c\\). Wait, but that's not how the problem is phrased. It just says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. Hmm, that seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from the \\(c\\) terms multiplied by \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Wait, that might make sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion gets multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) times \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). But wait, let me check that. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve all the terms from the \\(c\\) expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is misworded, or maybe I'm misinterpreting it. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be a sum over the terms involving \\(c\\). But that seems complicated, and I don't think that's what is intended. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, so the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That would make the coefficient a single number. Let me check that possibility. So, if that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, let me try that approach.\n\nFirst, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), as I found earlier.\n\nNow, from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), I get \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we multiply the coefficients from each part.\n\nSo, that's \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (with \\(c^0\\)) is 120.\n\nWait, but the original problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would include all the terms from the \\(c\\) expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a single coefficient. So, perhaps the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering only the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts, and treating the \\(c\\) part as separate. But that doesn't quite make sense either because the \\(c\\) part is multiplied in.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and ignoring the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, meaning that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all possible combinations of \\(c\\) terms. But then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is probably not what is intended.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a sum over the \\(c\\) terms. But that seems complicated, and I don't think that's what is being asked.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look back at the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, in the entire expansion, how many times does \\(a^2b^2\\) appear, multiplied by whatever powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is probably not intended.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient is a single number. So, perhaps that's the intended interpretation.\n\nGiven that, then the coefficient would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), giving 120.\n\nSo, I think that's the answer they're looking for.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my steps.\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using binomial theorem: coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using binomial theorem: the term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. Multiply these coefficients together: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120.\n\nSince the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), but just asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's intended to consider only the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., \\(c^0\\), making the coefficient a single number.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is considering the entire product, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the \\(c\\) terms multiplied by 6, which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and I don't think that's what the problem is asking for because it's more likely asking for a specific term where \\(c\\) is canceled out.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps the intended interpretation is that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and not worry about the \\(c\\) terms. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would include all the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is probably not intended.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient is a sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms. But that seems complicated, and I don't think that's the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120, as I found earlier.\n\nGiven that, I think the intended answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I don't consider the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient becomes 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense for a single coefficient.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. In \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\n2. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\n3. Multiply them together: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120.\n\nSo, I think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from each part:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. But the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes various powers of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, that's not right because each term in the product will be a combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all terms in the expansion where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) can be anything because the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so it's just the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which would make it a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a single coefficient. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But that's not correct because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term would just be the coefficient from the first part times each term from the second part. Wait, no, that's not right. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would result in a sum where each term is a coefficient from the second part multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a single number, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Therefore, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps the problem is considering \\(c\\) terms as well, but the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term. Wait, that might make sense. So, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared and \\(c\\) is to the zero power, meaning the constant term. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. That makes sense. So, let me break it down that way. So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I calculated earlier. Now, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in this expansion because when I multiply, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second part to give me a term with \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's apply the binomial theorem to this as well. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(6 - 2k\\). I need to find the term where the exponent is 0, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Now, since the two parts are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, that would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, if I think about the entire product, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as I found earlier. Simultaneously, the term \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which is when \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Yeah, that checks out. So, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\).

So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) be 6 times 64, which is 384? Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Wait, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't seem right either because usually, when they ask for the coefficient of a term, they're referring to the coefficient in the entire expression, considering all variables. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient as a number, so maybe I need to consider that \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is being multiplied by \\((a + b)^4\\), and since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I thought earlier, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 384. But let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is a product, so each term in the product is a combination of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes only from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, and it's multiplied by each term in the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a single number. So, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient as a number, implying that we're to consider the entire expression as a product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems odd because the problem didn't specify. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a constant, but that doesn't make sense either because \\(c\\) is a variable. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try another approach. Let me consider that \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I calculated earlier, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient as a number, so the answer is 384. But let me verify this by expanding both parts separately. First, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), as I did before, gives \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem: \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). Now, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6\\) multiplied by each coefficient in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient as a number, implying that we're to consider the entire expression and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be the sum of all coefficients from the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion multiplied by 6. As I calculated earlier, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient as a number, so the answer is 384. Wait, but let me check if that makes sense. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first polynomial, and the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a number. So, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient as a number, meaning that we're to consider the product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But that seems odd because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient as a number, so the answer is 384. I think that's the most plausible interpretation. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1 = (a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 times (c + 1/c), so it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). But if the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, then perhaps they mean the sum of the coefficients, which would be 1 * (1 + 1) = 2. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 2. Similarly, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\n2. The expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n\n3. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Wait, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by all possible terms in the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion, each time contributing a different power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\).

But that doesn't make sense because the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the question is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression. Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be paired with any term from the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion, but we just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) part. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the sum of coefficients would be when we set \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384, which seems too high. Wait, no, because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) and a power of \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when we multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the term becomes \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's not correct because each term is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times a specific power of \\(c\\), but since it's not specified, maybe it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try another approach. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this product, each term will be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and it is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. But wait, let me check this again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the question is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I misunderstood the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. That would make more sense because then we're looking for a specific term. So, let me try that approach. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), we need to find the terms in \\((a + b)^4\\) that contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) and the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that contribute to \\(c^0\\). So, first, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem: \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the final answer is 120. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but that was when considering all coefficients in the second expansion. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 384, but if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. So, which interpretation is correct? The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's a bit ambiguous. But in algebra, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) in a product of expressions, it typically means the coefficient regardless of the other variables, which would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expression. So, in that case, it would be 6 * 64 = 384. However, if the problem had specified \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 120. Since it's not specified, I think the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me check again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. So, in this case, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), you take the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by every term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each contributing a different power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the answer is 384. But wait, earlier I thought it was 120 when considering \\(c^0\\). So, which one is correct? I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so it's 384. But to be sure, let me consider an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1 = (a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). If I expand this, I get \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), but if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's the sum of coefficients, which would be 2 (since when c=1, it's 2). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2. Similarly, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expression, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would be 120, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), it's 384. Wait, but in my earlier example, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), but if we consider the coefficient of \\(a\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's 2 because the sum of coefficients is 2. So, in that case, yes, 384 is correct. Therefore, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by multiplying the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n3. Multiplying these results: \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

So, in other words, when you multiply the two expressions together, you'll have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion multiplied by 6. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems odd. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and then the rest is separate. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, and when you multiply this by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you get terms like 6a\u00b2b\u00b2c^k, where k ranges from -6 to 6 in steps of 2, I think. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all the coefficients from the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion, each multiplied by 6. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that when multiplying by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion, but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's just 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem might just be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a function of \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. That would make more sense because then it's a single term. So, let me re-examine the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for a coefficient, maybe it's just 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would involve more steps. Let me try that approach. So, if I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that means I need the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the power of 0. So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Then, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the constant term is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense because we're multiplying the coefficients from each part. So, I think that's the answer. But let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) has \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a constant term (c^0) with coefficient 20. So, when you multiply these together, the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) will have coefficient 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by multiplying the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) with the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1.

So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? But wait, that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) will cancel out or something? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again. When you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient will just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not exactly correct because when you multiply, the coefficients multiply, but the variables multiply as well. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you're effectively scaling the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by each coefficient, and since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms don't affect it. Wait, no, that's not right because the variables do multiply, but since we're only looking for a term without \\(c\\), maybe we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as well. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term like \\(c^k\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't the term we want. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero will result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think that's the correct approach. So, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already found as 6. Now, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that. Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\): \\(6 = 2m\\) so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, since the original expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) times 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, but let me double-check. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expression, but only the term with \\(c^0\\) will result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms will have \\(c\\) raised to some power, so they won't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

It's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\).

But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering only the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) and ignoring the \\(c\\) terms, but that would be strange. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression, which would include all the \\(c\\) terms. But I'm not sure. Let me think differently. Maybe I can consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as found earlier, and that's it because the rest of the terms involve \\(c\\). But that seems too simplistic.

Wait, is that right? Let me check. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\).

Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that the product includes terms with \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make it a polynomial in \\(c\\).

Wait, is that right? Let me think again. No, actually, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Because if we take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by a term involving \\(c\\) from the second part, then the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something like that, which isn't what we're looking for. So, the only way to get a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then multiply it by the coefficient 6 from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem for this. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the constant term is where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 20, because in the expansion, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, is that correct? Let me check again. So, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives us \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives us a constant term 20. So, when we multiply these two parts, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two expansions, so the coefficient is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, so the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense.

    "text": " Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) will just tag along, but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient for that term would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by whatever the constant term is in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), right? Wait, no, actually, that's not correct. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), it will come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the exponent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(c\\) don't interact with the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times something, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient, so maybe it's just 6? No, that can't be right because the other part is also an expansion. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem statement doesn't specify \\(c\\), it just says \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the problem is considering the product, but only looking at the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has different powers of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each would create a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's just 6 times 1, because the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 1? Wait, let me check that. Let me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponents of \\(c\\) are \\(6 - 2m\\) for \\(m\\) from 0 to 6. So, the constant term (where the exponent is 0) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which is when \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. So, the coefficient of the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that's not quite right. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, each term will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all terms where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and then any combination of \\(c\\) terms. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's considering the entire sum of coefficients for all possible \\(c\\) terms that come along with \\(a^2b^2\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has different powers of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each would contribute a different term. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial, provided that the variables match. But in this case, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that can't be right because that would mean the coefficient is 6 times something, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps I need to consider that the \\(c\\) terms are separate, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would be 6 times (the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too high. Let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that the \\(c\\) terms are part of the same expression, but since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), ignoring the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part, which would be 6. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. Wait, maybe I should think differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) as 6a^2b^2, and then it's multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that would be the coefficient. Alternatively, if the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, then it would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, now I'm confused. Let me clarify: when the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it's considering the entire expression, which includes \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients of terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), then it would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem just says \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think it's asking for all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all terms in the other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in other words, each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all \\(c\\) terms would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer.\n\nWait, but let me check with another approach. Let me consider that when you have two separate polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate variables, the coefficients don't interfere. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. So, that would be 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but that contradicts my earlier conclusion. Hmm. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing two different interpretations. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), then it would be 6 * 20 = 120. Since the problem doesn't specify any \\(c\\) terms, I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion, each term would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but with different powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of all those contributions, which is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is only interested in the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), then the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. But since the problem doesn't specify any \\(c\\) terms, I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the answer would be 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Let's compute this. \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be \\(c + 1/c\\), and the coefficient of \\(b\\) would be the same. But if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\), it's \\(c + 1/c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is the sum of coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion. So, applying that logic, in the given problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in the example, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is indeed \\(c + 1/c\\), which is the sum of coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion times the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first polynomial. So, yes, that seems to confirm that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 384.\n\nSo, after all that, I think the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let's compute \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients is 64. Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. So, 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion, so each term in the \\(c\\) expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 384.\n\nSo, I think the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's written as \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps the \\(c\\) terms are irrelevant because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. Wait, but that might not be the case because the entire expression is the product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, maybe the problem is written incorrectly, or perhaps I'm misinterpreting it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't make sense because the \\(c\\) terms would be multiplied by the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms.

So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high, and I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion without considering the \\(c\\) terms, which would just be 6. But that seems too simple, so maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) would be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a sum of terms involving different powers of \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial in \\(c\\). Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think I must have misinterpreted the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That would make more sense because then we're looking for a specific term in the product. So, let's assume that. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, to find this, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me compute that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the answer should be 120. Let me double-check my steps. First, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. So, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (assuming we're considering \\(c^0\\)) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the product of the relevant coefficients from each part of the expression. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):** Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):** Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Wait, that might not be correct because each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, because each term in the product is a term from the first expansion times a term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is being multiplied, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients from each expression where the variables multiply to give that term. But in this case, since the second expression doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expression and multiplying it by the constant term (with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)) from the second expression. But wait, the second expression is in terms of \\(c\\), so it doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), but when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just the coefficient times \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think we need to sum all the coefficients from the second expansion and multiply by the coefficient from the first part. Wait, no, that can't be right because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just one term, but in the product, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only affected by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient would be 6 (from the first part) times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Now, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of all coefficients, we can set \\(c = 1\\), because substituting 1 into the expression gives the sum of the coefficients. So, let's compute \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me check that again. Because if I expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for each term. The sum of all coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so as I did before, it's 2^6 = 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, is that correct? Let me think again. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\), so when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial is multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, each contributing a different power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean we need to sum all the coefficients from the second polynomial and multiply by the coefficient from the first part? Because each term in the second polynomial contributes a different power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. So, yes, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we would need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial and multiply by 6. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), I think the correct approach is to multiply 6 by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384. Let me confirm this with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{1}{1} = 1\\), and the sum of coefficients in the second part is \\((1 + 1)^1 = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Let's expand it: \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2 (from \\(a c\\) and \\(a/c\\)), which matches 1 * 2 = 2. So, that seems correct. Similarly, if I take \\((a + b)^2 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{2}{2} = 1\\), and the sum of coefficients in the second part is \\((1 + 1)^2 = 4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the product would be 1 * 4 = 4. Let's expand: \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is \\(1 * (c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2)\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would be 1 * (1 + 2 + 1) = 4, which is correct. So, applying that logic to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these results gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6, and the rest of the expression is multiplied by it, does that mean the coefficient remains 6? Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, actually, no. Wait, because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Wait, no, the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is being multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the \\(c\\) terms are separate, does that mean that the coefficient is just 6, and the \\(c\\) terms don't affect it? Wait, but that can't be right because the problem is in the product of two expressions, so perhaps I'm misapplying something. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second. But in this case, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are in the first part, and the \\(c\\) terms are in the second part. So, when you multiply them, each term would be of the form \\(a^k b^{4 - k} c^m\\) or something like that. But the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term (i.e., the term where \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if I take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by any term in the second part, that would give me \\(a^2b^2c^m\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^m\\), but the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies \\(c^0\\). So, perhaps I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times that constant term. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the term where the exponent is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 20, which is 120. Wait, let me make sure I'm doing this correctly. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the constant term in the other expansion is 20, so when I multiply these, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. So, that should be the answer. Let me just double-check. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all terms in the second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\), which is separate. Wait, no, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so it's just 6. But that contradicts my earlier thought where I considered the constant term. Hmm, maybe I'm confusing something here. Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. Wait, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's 6 times the entire expansion, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, but the problem might just want the coefficient without considering \\(c\\). Wait, no, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so perhaps it's considering the entire expression, which includes \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps I need to treat it as a product, and the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's not correct because when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term in the second expansion would be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times each term in the second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a sum involving \\(c\\), but the problem is probably asking for the coefficient when considering all variables, so perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Wait, maybe I should think of the entire expression as a product, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that don't involve \\(c\\), because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) in it. So, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and no \\(c\\) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120. So, that's the answer. Wait, let me confirm this with an example. Let's say I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). And \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). So, when I multiply these together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will multiply each term in the second part, resulting in \\(6a^2b^2c^6 + 24a^2b^2c^4 + 90a^2b^2c^2 + 120a^2b^2 + 90a^2b^2/c^2 + 24a^2b^2/c^4 + 6a^2b^2/c^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120, because that's the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, that confirms it. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought maybe the coefficient is just 6, but now I see that it's 6 times the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, so 6*20=120. So, that makes sense.\n\nSo, in summary, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero:\n\\[\n6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n\\]\nThe coefficient of the constant term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from both expansions:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, first, let me find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the constant term. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times this 20. Earlier, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. I think I might have made a mistake in considering the multiplication. Because when you have two separate variables, \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), the coefficients don't interfere with each other. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part, but that's not correct because the second part isn't a constant. Wait, no, that's not right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum over all possible products of coefficients from each polynomial where the exponents add up to that term. But in this case, since \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\) are separate variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because any other term involving \\(c\\) would result in a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\) alone. So, yes, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), then we would have to consider the product of coefficients from each part where the exponents add up to that term, but in this case, since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), it's only affected by the constant term in the \\(c\\) part. So, I think my initial conclusion was correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20.

So, maybe I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\). That makes sense. So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The constant term is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, let's expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each expansion. That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in \\(c\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me go through it again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), when I multiply the two polynomials, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384, which is different from what I found earlier. Hmm, so now I'm confused. Which approach is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpreted the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem actually wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense, as it's a specific term. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120, as I found earlier. That seems more plausible. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms and treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, but I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would give a coefficient that's a polynomial, not a single number. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, to confirm, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying them together gives 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. I think that's the correct answer. Let me just check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Correct.\n\nNext, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in the expansion, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). Setting \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) gives \\(k = 3\\). The term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Correct.\n\nMultiplying the two coefficients: 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. Therefore, the answer should be 120.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me consider another approach. Maybe I can think of the entire product as a single expression and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But in that case, since \\(c\\) is separate, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, that would mean the coefficient is 6 multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is only considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts, and the \\(c\\) parts are irrelevant, but that doesn't seem right because the expression includes both. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, I'm confident that the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the product of the binomial expansions of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**  \n   Using the binomial theorem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**  \n   The expansion has terms of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Thus, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Combining the coefficients:**  \n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since the second expression only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), when I multiply by a term from \\((a + b)^4\\), say \\(a^2b^2\\), it will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so any terms involving \\(c\\) will be multiplied by 1 when considering the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, that might not be the case. Let me think again. No, actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, that can't be right because then the coefficient would be a sum involving terms with \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the entire product is considered as a single expression, and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't make much sense because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so the coefficient would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for a numerical coefficient, so maybe I'm supposed to consider only the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is the constant term in the second expansion. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me figure that out. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the first part gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part's constant term is 20, so when multiplied together, it's 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the entire product being \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would involve all possible terms from the second expansion, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe it's just 6 multiplied by the entire second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that in the product, each term is a product of terms from each bracket. So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to pick \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first bracket, and any term from the second bracket. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second bracket. But that can't be, because then the coefficient would be a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, I must have made a mistake earlier. Let me think again. Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\).

So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, which would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6. But that seems too simple, and I feel like I'm missing something. Let me try to look at the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is only considering the part of the expression involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the \\(c\\) terms are being treated as constants or something.

But since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. Because each term in the product would be a combination of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term from the second part, each of which is a term with some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would mean we need to sum up all the coefficients from the second part because each term from the second part will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. Alternatively, if we think of it as multiplying two polynomials, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. But wait, the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and the sum of its coefficients is when we set \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) times 64 (sum of coefficients in the second part), which is 384. Wait, but that seems too high. Let me check my reasoning again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the variables \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\) are independent, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part has terms with \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression. Therefore, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. As I calculated earlier, the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. But let me think again: when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in one part is multiplied by the entire other expression. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second part, each of which is a term with some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be 6 times each term in the second expansion, but that would result in terms like \\(6 \\times c^6\\), \\(6 \\times c^4\\), etc., which is not a single coefficient. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible terms, but that would require more information. Alternatively, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me re-examine the problem statement: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the expression is a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the \\(c\\) expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by each coefficient from the second part, but since the second part has multiple terms, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But wait, that's not correct because each term in the second part has different powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term, you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second expansion. But the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we can treat the entire second expansion as a scalar. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which doesn't make sense because the expansion has multiple terms. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the product of the coefficients from each part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part has multiple terms. Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, without considering the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. But that seems too simplistic. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), \\(1/c^6\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6a^2b^2c^6 + 6 \\times 6 a^2b^2c^4 + 6 \\times 15 a^2b^2c^2 + 6 \\times 20 a^2b^2 + 6 \\times 15 a^2b^2/c^2 + 6 \\times 6 a^2b^2/c^4 + 6 \\times 1 a^2b^2/c^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is not a single number because it's multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean summing all the coefficients from the second expansion and multiplying by 6. As calculated earlier, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384. Wait, but that seems a bit counterintuitive because the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the entire product is considered. Therefore, I think the correct approach is to realize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from the second part. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384. But let me verify this with another approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one part is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is 6, and it's multiplied by the entire second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times each term in the second polynomial, but that would result in multiple terms. However, if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then we need to sum all the coefficients from the second polynomial and multiply by 6. The sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the binomial expansion of each part. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64 when \\(c = 1\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 * 64 = 384.\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6, multiplied by whatever the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is. Wait, but actually, no.

So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second part, but since the second part doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, maybe the coefficient just remains 6? Hmm, that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is just multiplied by each term in the second part. But since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the same as the coefficient in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that can't be right because the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), and we're not looking for a term involving \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not correct either. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various exponents \\(k\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply that we're considering only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) in it. Wait, that's a good point. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because that's the only term that would result in a constant term when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let me calculate that. First, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two expressions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Because if you have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^k\\), that term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the term where \\(k=0\\) in the second part will give us a pure \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. Hmm, that makes sense. So, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, no, that's not right either. Let me clarify. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, I need to find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). How do I find the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial? Well, the sum of the coefficients is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but let me double-check that. Because when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) only comes from the first polynomial, and the second polynomial doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms.
