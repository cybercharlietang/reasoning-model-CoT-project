    "text": " Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all. So, perhaps I can just take the coefficient from the first part and multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the second part doesn't affect it. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), maybe the second part just contributes a factor of 1, or maybe I need to consider that the entire second part is multiplied by the first part. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this product, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we need to find the term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is a constant term (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero). Because when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by that constant term, we'll get a term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, which is what we're looking for. So, actually, I think I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, which is 6. So, let me work on that. To find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero for the constant term, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives a constant term 20. So, when you multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only need to consider the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term and the constant term from the second expansion. So, yes, that should be 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the entire expression being the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, that would mean 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's correct. Let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). And \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would have terms like \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). So, when you multiply these together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be 6a^2b^2 multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only take the constant term from the second expansion, which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20.

But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider that the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. However, since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe I can treat the second part as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). But wait, that might not be correct because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, perhaps I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, but that's not exactly right because the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which has terms involving different powers of \\(c\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term in the second part will just multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.

Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, but actually, no, that's not quite accurate because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that's not possible because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the product, but when multiplied by terms in the second part, it would have factors of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the question is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But that's not standard. Usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term, you consider the term in the entire product. So, perhaps I need to clarify: the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) is \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. That makes more sense. So, in that case, the approach would be to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply the two, you get \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, that seems like the right approach. So, first, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about that. Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem: \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\): \\(6 = 2k\\) \u2192 \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the final answer should be 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, first, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). That seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes here.

But wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), so when you multiply it by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it will result in terms that have \\(c\\) raised to some power. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not any specific power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, in the entire product, we're looking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\). But in the product, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m\\) or something like that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) in the second part. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), it would result in a term that includes \\(c\\), which would make it a different term. So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, you have to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 (from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that using the binomial theorem. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That is, solve \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). So, \\(6 = 2m\\) implies \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me check again. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. When you multiply these two parts, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that seems right.

But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the \\(c\\) terms won't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will have multiple terms, each with different powers of \\(c\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient will just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not right either. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. Because each term in the first expression, when multiplied by each term in the second, contributes to the overall product. But since we're only interested in the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, the \\(c\\) terms can be anything because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. Let me denote the first part as \\(P = (a + b)^4\\) and the second part as \\(Q = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the product \\(P \\times Q\\) will have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m c^{-n}\\) etc., but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can consider that term in \\(P\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(Q\\), because each term in \\(Q\\) will just contribute a coefficient that's multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\(P \\times Q\\) will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\). But wait, is that right? Because in \\(P \\times Q\\), each term in \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\(P\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and when multiplied by \\(Q\\), which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it becomes \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" Oh, wait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, we're treating \\(c\\) as an independent variable, and we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of what's happening with \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's actually the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would be the case if we were combining the two expressions in a way that all terms are multiplied together, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(c\\) is separate, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm misinterpreting the question. Let me think again. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in the factors. But in this case, since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms can be anything, so the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. So, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already did: it's 6. Now, we need to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if we set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me verify. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6 times the entire expansion, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the question is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the answer should be 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient from the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the other part of the product must contribute a term that is 1 when considering \\(c\\). Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), we need to find the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because \\(c^0\\) is just 1, so when we multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), we get \\(a^2b^2\\) times 1, which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient we're looking for is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, first, we already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me figure that out. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed the middle term, and \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(m = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them together gives 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I missed anything here.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   - The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\) in the binomial expansion.\n   - The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   - We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(m = 3\\).\n   - The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Combining the coefficients:**\n   - Multiply the coefficients from both parts: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that right? Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, say \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), the coefficient of a specific term in \\(P(a, b)\\) (like \\(a^2b^2\\)) in the product \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\) will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(Q(c)\\). But since \\(Q(c)\\) is a separate variable, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) times the entire \\(Q(c)\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficients should be scalars, not polynomials. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me clarify: The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, for example, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that can't be right because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) be 6 times 64? That seems too large. Wait, no, that's not correct because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each of those terms is a separate term in the product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. I think I'm making a mistake here. Let me approach this differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of those coefficients becomes part of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, to find the total coefficient, I need to compute 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting 1 for all variables. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but that seems too high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part and \\(c\\) is in another, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a scalar. That can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But let me verify this with a different approach. Let's consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my reasoning. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient is actually 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I calculated before, the sum of coefficients is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me check this with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\). The product would be \\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be \\(c + 1/c\\), the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be \\(2(c + 1/c)\\), and the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) would be \\(c + 1/c\\). But if I'm asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. But in the original problem, the answer is supposed to be a number, so maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. Let me check that. If that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, let's find that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 times 20, which is 120. But the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), it just asked for \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But that can't be, because the problem expects a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I must have misinterpreted the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem didn't specify, so maybe I should assume that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean summing over all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), leading to 6 times 64, which is 384. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is intended to have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120. Let me check that approach. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), then the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the problem expects a numerical answer. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64 = 384. But I'm not sure. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I expand this, it's a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that includes all possible powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed a polynomial, but the problem seems to expect a numerical answer. So, perhaps the problem is miswritten, or I'm misinterpreting it. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but only considering the coefficient as a scalar, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 times 20 = 120. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), meaning that it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. I think I need to clarify. Let me look up similar problems. Typically, when asked for the coefficient of a term in a product of polynomials, if the term involves variables from both polynomials, you have to consider their exponents. But in this case, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, the problem seems to expect a numerical answer, so perhaps it's intended to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to have all variables, but as it stands, I think the intended answer is 120, considering the constant term in \\(c\\). So, to wrap up, I think the coefficient is 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, giving 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(c\\) terms won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think that when we multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can treat it separately. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we only need to consider the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because \\(c^0 = 1\\), which is the only term that won't introduce any \\(c\\) terms when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, I've already found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term: \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, which means \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\): \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) \u2192 \\(2m = 6\\) \u2192 \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two parts, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, but only the constant term (c^0) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, because any other term would introduce \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the overall coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.

    "text": " Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, maybe I can just find the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and that's it. Wait, but let me think again. When I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms will be multiplied together. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think the coefficient would just be 6 times whatever coefficient comes from the \\(c\\) part when the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2.

But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that term must come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part and the constant term in the second part, because any term involving \\(c\\) would introduce \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which we don't want.

Wait, but let me think again. If I'm just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then when I multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will just be a constant multiplier for the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.

Wait, no, that can't be right because each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a separate term, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in a different part of the product, their exponents don't affect the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is being multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient would actually be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of the coefficients in a binomial expansion is found by setting the variable to 1. So, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), setting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384? Wait, that seems high. Let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is simply the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 multiplied by each term in the expansion, but that's not how it works because each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is separate. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, in this case, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's just the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But that can't be right because the expansion of the second part has many terms, some with positive exponents of \\(c\\) and some with negative. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a single number, not a polynomial. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Oh, I see, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which includes all the terms from both expansions. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, no, because each term in the product is a combination of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes only from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, and it's multiplied by every term in the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they become part of the product. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I thought earlier, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check with a different approach. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the other part doesn't affect it because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). But that can't be right because the entire expression is the product of two polynomials, so the coefficients would multiply. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's just the product of the coefficients. So, the coefficient from the first part is 6, and the coefficient from the second part is the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, without considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, the answer is 6, but that doesn't seem right because the entire expression includes both parts. Wait, no, because when you multiply the two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part is a constant when considering \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, yes, it's 6 times 64, which is 384. Let me confirm this with a small example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding \\((a + b)^2\\) gives \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). The second part is \\(c + 1/c\\). Now, the product is \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because in the product, the highest power of \\(a\\) is 2 and \\(b\\) is 2, but in the second part, it's only \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so there are no \\(b\\) terms to multiply to get \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but in this case, the coefficient is zero. Hmm, that's different. So, maybe my earlier approach is incorrect. Wait, in this small example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because you can't get \\(b^2\\) from the second part. But in the original problem, the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which doesn't have any \\(b\\) terms. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, and the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part just multiplies each term. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, but in my small example, that approach would suggest that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 1 times (sum of coefficients in \\(c + 1/c\\)), which is 2, so 1 * 2 = 2. But in reality, the product is \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\), which expands to \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2ab c + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). There is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient is zero. So, my earlier approach was wrong. Therefore, I must have made a mistake. So, what's the correct way? Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the only way to get an \\(a^2b^2\\) term is from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, and the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part doesn't contribute to \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by other terms involving \\(c\\). Wait, but in the small example, that approach gave me a wrong answer. So, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is just 6, because the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). But in the small example, that approach would give me 1 times something, but the actual coefficient was zero. So, I'm confused now. Let me think differently. Maybe I should consider that the entire product is a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, each term in the product is of the form \\(a^k b^m c^n\\) where \\(k + m = 4\\) and \\(n\\) is determined by the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would require \\(k = 2\\) and \\(m = 2\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, because the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part by the constant term from the second part. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That makes sense because only the constant term would leave the \\(a^2b^2\\) term unaffected by \\(c\\). So, let me calculate the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense because in the product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied only by the constant term from the second expansion, which is 20. So, the final coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Let me double-check this with the small example to see if it works. In the small example, \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) should be zero because you can't get \\(b^2\\) from the second part. Wait, but using the same approach, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\) is the term where exponent is zero. So, \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\). There is no constant term, so the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is zero. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times zero, which is zero. That matches the actual expansion, where there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, this approach seems correct.

    "text": " Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, maybe I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not correct because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), that term will only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term (if any) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a separate expression; when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it's like \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the sum of all terms would just be the value when \\(c = 1\\), but I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. Maybe I need to consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But actually, in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part and any term in the second part. But wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a separate variable from \\(c\\), so in the product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would just be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but considering all possible terms, including those involving \\(c\\). But no, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that would indeed be 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and not considering the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part because it's a separate variable. But that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product. Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is a product, so each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the sum of coefficients is 64, as I found earlier, then 6 times 64 is 384. So, the coefficient would be 384. Let me confirm this by another approach. Alternatively, maybe I should expand both parts separately and then multiply. But that would take a long time. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient, not the entire term, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 times 64, so 384. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of the two expansions, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) (since \\(c^0 = 1\\)) would be the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) and \\(c^0\\) in each part. Wait, but in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is the constant term. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. So, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the constant term is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 20, which is 120. Wait, that contradicts my earlier conclusion of 384. Hmm, so which one is correct? Let me think carefully. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Now, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) (with coefficient 6) and any term in the second expansion. But wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it becomes \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\left(\\text{something}\\right)\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term, and the \\(c\\) terms would be separate. Wait, no, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is separate from the \\(c\\) terms. So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficients add up. So, that would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But earlier, when I considered the constant term, I got 120. So, which is correct? Let me clarify: the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). In the product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) ranges over the exponents from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the product as \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\left(\\text{some combination of }c\\text{ terms}\\right)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each coefficient in the second part is multiplied by 6, and then summed up. So, that would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 times 20, which is 120. But since the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on \\(c\\), it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire second expansion, so 6 times 64 is 384. Wait, but that seems counterintuitive because the second expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), so how can \\(a^2b^2\\) have a coefficient that's the product of 6 and 64? Let me think again. Maybe I'm confusing the terms. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are independent of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Because the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. Wait, that makes more sense. Because when you multiply by something that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) remain the same. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just 6. But that contradicts my earlier thought. Hmm. Let me check with a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1)^1\\). The expansion is \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product is zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, that's not helpful. Alternatively, if I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1)^0\\), which is just \\((a + b)^2\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because there's no such term. Wait, that's not helpful either. Maybe a better example: \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1)^1\\). The product is \\(a^2c + a^2 + 2abc + 2ab + b^2c + b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, so in this case, the coefficient remains zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part. So, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a separate variable, the coefficient remains 6 because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, maybe the correct answer is 6. But that seems too simple, and I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6. But then why include the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part? Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 times 20, which is 120. But the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I'm confused. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient times \\(c^k\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's the sum of all those coefficients. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 times 64, which is 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is a red herring because it's multiplied by something else. But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply by another expression, the coefficients change. Wait, no, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms remain unaffected by the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Because when you multiply by another polynomial, it's like scaling the entire expression by that polynomial, but the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) remain the same. Wait, that makes sense. For example, if you have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) is still 1, and the coefficient of \\(a^1b^1\\) is still 2, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient remains 6. So, the answer is 6. But earlier, I thought it was 120 or 384. I'm confused now. Let me try to think differently. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). The product P(a, b) * Q(c) will have terms where each term of P is multiplied by each term of Q. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q(c). Because each term in Q(c) is a coefficient times a power of c, so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it's like \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient times c^k. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of c, we need to sum all those coefficients. So, that would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in Q(c). The sum of coefficients in Q(c) is found by setting c = 1, so Q(1) = (1 + 1)^6 = 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that must be the correct answer. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. But earlier, I thought it was 6, but that was a mistake because I was considering the independence of variables, but in reality, when you have a product of polynomials, the coefficients of terms in one polynomial are scaled by the sum of coefficients in the other polynomial. So, the correct answer is 384. Let me confirm this with a simpler example. Let\u2019s say P(a, b) = (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2, and Q(c) = (c + 1)^1 = c + 1. The product is (a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1) = a^2c + a^2 + 2abc + 2ab + b^2c + b^2. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product is 0 because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, that's different. Hmm, but in this case, P(a, b) doesn't have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Let me try another example where P(a, b) has a term that could lead to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by Q(c). Let\u2019s say P(a, b) = (a + b)^4, which has a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and Q(c) = (c + 1)^0 = 1. Then the product is just P(a, b) * 1 = P(a, b), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, which matches the earlier thought. Now, if Q(c) = (c + 1)^1, then the product is P(a, b)*(c + 1). So, each term in P(a, b) is multiplied by 1 and by c. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6*1 = 6, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^1\\) is 6*1 = 6. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c, then it's the sum of coefficients where the term is \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any k. So, that would be 6 + 6 = 12. But in reality, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present as \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^1\\), each with coefficient 6. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c is 6 + 6 = 12, which is 6 times the sum of coefficients in Q(c), which is 2 (since Q(c) = c + 1, sum of coefficients is 1 + 1 = 2). So, 6 * 2 = 12, which matches. Therefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of coefficients in Q(c) = \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in Q(c) is found by setting c = 1, so Q(1) = (1 + 1)^6 = 64. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, the answer is 384. I think that's correct now.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives 6. The entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, we multiply 6 by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{384}"

    "text": " Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, maybe the entire coefficient will just be the product of the coefficients from each part, but since I'm only looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, and the other part is multiplied by it, perhaps I can treat them separately. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, the coefficients multiply as well. But in this case, since I'm looking for a specific term in the product, I might need to consider how the terms combine. Let me think again. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I expand both separately, then when I multiply them, each term from the first expansion will multiply each term from the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is in the second part for the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, no, because when you multiply, every term in the first expansion gets multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\). Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me clarify: the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, when you expand the product, each term will be a product of a term from the first polynomial and a term from the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on the powers of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think implies that we are looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) terms, but since the problem doesn't specify any \\(c\\) terms, perhaps we just need the coefficient in the first part, and the second part is contributing a factor that might affect the overall coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think differently. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and the rest of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is multiplied by it. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually a polynomial in \\(c\\), right? Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and we're to find the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because each term would have different powers of \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but without any constraints on its power. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that might be the case. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficients add up. So, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already found to be 6. Then, we need to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). How do we find the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial? Well, one way is to substitute \\(c = 1\\), because substituting 1 into the polynomial gives the sum of all coefficients. So, let's compute \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me check if that makes sense. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we need to consider only the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because if we're looking for a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\), then the \\(c\\) part must be \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. So, let's re-examine. First, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the middle term, because the exponents go from 6 down to -6 in steps of -2. So, the general term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). That seems more reasonable. Let me double-check. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when \\(k = 3\\), the exponent is \\(6 - 6 = 0\\), so the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, when we multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by 20, giving a total coefficient of \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought about substituting \\(c = 1\\) to get the sum of coefficients, but that gave me 64, which seems different. But I think I was wrong in that approach because the problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would require the \\(c\\) terms to cancel out, i.e., the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero. So, the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\): that's \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\): that's \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiply them together: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in step 2. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), \\(k = 3\\), so the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\\). So, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the middle term is when \\(k = 3\\), which is \\(20\\). So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, does that mean that any term in the product that has \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\) is considered? Or is it only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero? I think it's the latter because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, implying that the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, I think my approach is correct.\n\nYes, I'm confident now that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is for the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but actually, no. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems like it would involve a lot of terms. But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all. So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that might not be correct either because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has some power of \\(c\\), but when multiplied by \\((a + b)^4\\), which has \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms would be separate. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that might not be correct. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the coefficient is 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because only the constant term would not have any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply it by \\(a^2b^2\\), you'd still have \\(a^2b^2\\) times a constant, which would be the coefficient. So, perhaps I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6 to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That seems more accurate. So, let me try that approach. So, first, I'll find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(6 = 2m\\) implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but hold on, is that correct? Let me make sure. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives a constant term of 20, so when you multiply them together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by 20, so the coefficient would indeed be 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term in the second part. That seems correct. Let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), with terms like \\(c^6, 6c^4, 15c^2, 20, 15/c^2, 6/c^4, 1/c^6\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but only the constant term (20) will result in a term that is \\(a^2b^2\\) times a constant, without any \\(c\\) terms. All other terms will have \\(c\\) raised to some power, so the only term contributing to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, yes, the coefficient is 120. Therefore, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. When you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the entire expression becomes a product of two polynomials. So, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\) (which is 1), you get \\(a^2b^2\\), and that's the term we're interested in. So, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\).

Now, going back to the original product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients we found from each part.

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the \\(c\\) part doesn't affect it. Let me think. If I'm multiplying two polynomials, the terms in the product are formed by multiplying terms from each polynomial.

But that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion, so the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, the variables are separate: \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part, and \\(c\\) is in the other. So, when you multiply, the terms from the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) part will be multiplied by terms from the \\(c\\) part. But since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the \\(c\\) expansion will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, and since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we have to consider all possible coefficients from the \\(c\\) expansion multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) coefficient. Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Maybe another way: The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms like \\(a^4, a^3b, a^2b^2, ab^3, b^4\\), each multiplied by their respective coefficients. Similarly, expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives terms involving \\(c^6, c^5 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c}\\), etc. Now, when I multiply these two expansions, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, for example, \\(a^4\\) from the first expansion would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, giving terms like \\(a^4c^6, a^4c^5 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c}\\), and so on. Similarly, \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, giving terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6, a^2b^2c^5 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c}\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, because otherwise, you'd have \\(c\\) terms attached. Wait, that makes more sense. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term that has \\(c\\) in it, you'd get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem is just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only be the case when \\(c^k\\) is \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. So, I was wrong earlier; I don't need to sum all the coefficients, just the coefficient of the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) in the second expansion. So, let me first find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we found earlier as 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that. Using the binomial theorem again: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That is, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\): \\(6 = 2m\\) \u2192 \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which happens at \\(m = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, multiplying these together gives 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of the entire product as \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), since it's independent of \\(c\\), it's just the product of the coefficients from each part where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, and the exponents of \\(c\\) sum to zero. So, that's correct.

When I multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, that means I only need to consider the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) will still be \\(a^2b^2\\), whereas any other power of \\(c\\) would change the term. So, I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because when I multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), that's the only term that will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, perhaps I can treat the two parts separately. That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier, and then the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is another binomial expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the expansion includes terms with different powers of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because then it would include all the terms with \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But actually, no, because each term in the product is a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) times a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) would be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient can't be a polynomial; it has to be a constant. Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. When you have two expressions multiplied together, say \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\), then the coefficient of a specific term in \\(P(a, b)\\) would be multiplied by the entire expression \\(Q(c)\\). But in this case, \\(Q(c)\\) is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a sum of terms involving different powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, that means that in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) would be a different term. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(Q(c)\\), which would include all the \\(c\\) terms. But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a single number, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a polynomial in variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a single number. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, that means I need to find the term where in \\((a + b)^4\\), we have \\(a^2b^2\\), which as we found has a coefficient of 6, and in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so that when multiplied together, the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, leaving \\(a^2b^2\\). So, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Once we have both coefficients, we can multiply them together to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. Okay, so let's work on \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, this expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(k = 3\\), and its coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficients we found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. Wait, but let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20. When you multiply these two terms together, you get \\(6 \\times 20 \\times a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120 \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, that seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes here. The key was realizing that to get the term \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, we needed the \\(c^0\\) term from the second expansion, and then multiplying the two coefficients together.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient for this term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the two coefficients found:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, maybe the coefficient is just 6, as I found earlier, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right either because when you multiply by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a sum of terms, each term will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms.

So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the \\(c\\) terms are separate, perhaps the coefficient is just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms don't influence the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply by the entire expansion, each term in the \\(c\\) expansion would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, effectively scaling it by each coefficient in the \\(c\\) expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think the correct approach is to consider that each term in the \\(c\\) expansion contributes to the overall coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the \\(c\\) terms are separate, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the \\(c\\) terms would be part of other terms in the expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so I think the answer is 6. Wait, no, that can't be right because when you multiply by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by each term in that expansion, so each term in the expansion would contribute to the coefficient. So, for example, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), etc., but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from the \\(c\\) expansion multiplied by 6. So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64, as I thought earlier, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Wait, but let me make sure. Let me think of a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) would be \\(c + 1/c\\), and similarly for \\(b\\). But if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it would be \\(c + 1/c\\), which is 2 when \\(c = 1\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, which is the sum of the coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion. So, applying that logic here, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, let me try another approach. Maybe I can consider that the entire expression is a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As I calculated earlier, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. That seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to consider the entire expansion, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is that when you have two separate variables, \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), the coefficient of a specific term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) would be multiplied by the entire expansion of the other variable's terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the \\(a, b\\) part times the sum of all coefficients from the \\(c\\) part, because each term in the \\(c\\) expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributing to the overall coefficient. So, yes, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, let me check with a specific example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\). So, the product would be \\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be \\(c + 1/c\\), which is 2 when \\(c = 1\\). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is indeed 2, which is the sum of the coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion times the coefficient from the \\(a\\) part, which was 1. So, that seems to confirm that the approach is correct.\n\nTherefore, applying this to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). That's correct. So, 6 times 64 is indeed 384.\n\nSo, after all that, I think the coefficient is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem and consider the contributions from each part of the expression.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."
