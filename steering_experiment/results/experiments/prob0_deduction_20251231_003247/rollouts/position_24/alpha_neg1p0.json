So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me double-check that. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial.

I don't think I made any mistakes here, but let me just verify the binomial coefficients again. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is indeed 6, and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120.

Let me check that logic again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then when I expand it, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\) times \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\) which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\).

So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), and so on, down to \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 1\\) (the constant term). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, we need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, let me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term 20 in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2 = 120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, let me double-check. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(6a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives a constant term of 20, so 6 times 20 is indeed 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Yeah, that makes sense. I don't think I missed anything here. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by expanding each part of the expression separately and then multiplying the relevant coefficients. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) to find the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0), which is 20.\n3.

That should give me the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, let's work on finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).

I don't think I made a mistake here, but let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the entire expression is a product, so each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part would only pair with the constant term in the second part to produce a term that's \\(a^2b^2\\) times a constant, which would contribute to the coefficient.
