Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).

For example, if I take a term with \\(c^1\\) and multiply it by a term in \\((a + b)^4\\), would that somehow result in a term without \\(c\\)? No, because if you multiply \\(c^1\\) by anything, it would still have a \\(c\\) term.

Okay, so I already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to find the constant term in that expansion.

Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Let me just double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which happens at \\(m = 3\\), giving a coefficient of 20. So, 6 * 20 is 120. That seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " So, that means the coefficient we're looking for is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, I already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to expand that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(6 - 2m\\). We're looking for the term where the exponent is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, is that all? Let me double-check. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20. When you multiply these two parts together, the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is when you multiply 6 by 20, giving 120. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, if I think about the entire product, \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion would be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\) times \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when you look for the term where the exponent of \\(a\\) is 2 and \\(b\\) is 2, that happens when \\(k = 2\\) in the first part, and for the second part, you need \\(c^0\\), which happens when \\(m = 3\\), as we found. So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\) times \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^0\\), which is 6 * 20 * \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient is indeed 120. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the contributions from both parts of the product.
