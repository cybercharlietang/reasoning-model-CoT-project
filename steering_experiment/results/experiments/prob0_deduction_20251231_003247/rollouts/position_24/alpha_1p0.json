So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the constant term in the other expansion is 20, so 6 * 20 is indeed 120. So, the coefficient should be 120.

    "text": " So, perhaps the coefficient we're looking for is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, first, as I found, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply 6 by that coefficient, you'll get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\), since \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, how do I find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Let me think. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That is, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120. Wait, let me check if I missed anything. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is only affected by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and the \\(c^0\\) term from the second part. So, multiplying those coefficients gives the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expansion as a product of two polynomials, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and the constant term from the second part. So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's right. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. So, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is indeed 6, because 4 choose 2 is 6. And \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20, because 6 choose 3 is 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it another way. Suppose I write out the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is 6a^2b^2. Then, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(c^6 + 6c^5 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c} + 15c^4 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^2} + 20c^3 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^3} + 15c^2 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^4} + 6c \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^5} + \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\). Simplifying each term: \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when you multiply 6a^2b^2 by 20, you get 120a^2b^2. So, that's the term we're interested in. So, the coefficient is indeed 120. That confirms my earlier calculation.\n\nI think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe are interested in the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\).

Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part, so that would be 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, let me just double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, that's correct. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, which I found by setting the exponent to zero, which gave m=3, so that term is indeed 20. Multiplying them together gives 120, so that seems right. I don't think I made a mistake here. Yeah, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."
