    "text": " 1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found to be 6. 2. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on the second part. So, expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem again. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Since these are being multiplied together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 * 20 times \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 120. I think that makes sense. Alternatively, I could think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials, and when you multiply them, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. But since we're only interested in the term that gives \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only need the constant term from the second polynomial. So, yeah, 6 * 20 = 120. I don't think I made any mistakes here. Let me just recap: The coefficient from the first part is 6, and from the second part, the constant term is 20, so the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the answer should be 120.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't overlook anything. Is there any other term in the second polynomial that could contribute to the constant term when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, no, because the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\), and \\(a^2b^2\\) is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) is to take the constant term from the second polynomial. So, yes, 20 is correct. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.

Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2.
