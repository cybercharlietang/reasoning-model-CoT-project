Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).

So, let's work on that second part. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\cdot c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because \\(c^0 = 1\\), which is the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\): \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) implies \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.

So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients: 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me double-check that. Because the problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion and the constant term in the second expansion. So, yes, that makes sense. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Is there a possibility that another term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) could contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term? For example, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second polynomial. So, yes, I think I'm correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. So, I think that's the answer. Let me recap: 1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. 2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20. 3. Multiply these two coefficients together to get 6 * 20 = 120.
