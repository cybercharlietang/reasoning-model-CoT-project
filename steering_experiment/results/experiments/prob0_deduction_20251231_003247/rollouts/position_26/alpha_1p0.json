Let me handle the second part now. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can also be done using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, \\(c^{6 - m} \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^m} = c^{6 - 2m}\\).

Let me figure out how to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here.
