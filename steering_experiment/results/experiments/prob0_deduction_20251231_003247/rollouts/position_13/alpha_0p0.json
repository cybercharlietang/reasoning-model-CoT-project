    "text": " Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe the second part doesn't affect that? Or does it? Let me think. Actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the \\(c\\) terms in the second part might not affect it. Wait, no, that's not right. Because the entire expression is the product of two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by every term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the second part doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. So, actually, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is just multiplied by the entire second part, which is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), perhaps the coefficient is just the coefficient from the first part times the entire second part. Wait, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is just asking for a numerical coefficient. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering the multiplication with the second part. But since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But that seems odd because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. But in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems more complicated, and the problem might just be expecting a numerical coefficient, so maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, but since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part times the entire second part. So, that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is likely expecting a numerical value, not an expression in \\(c\\). Hmm, perhaps I need to clarify. Wait, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would indeed be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too involved, and I might be overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, and since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, not a polynomial. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that the term doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all, so we have to consider terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. That is, in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we need to find the constant term, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would give a term with \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the coefficient from the first part times the constant term from the second part. That makes sense because then the coefficient would be a numerical value, not involving \\(c\\). So, let me check that. So, first, I find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, that seems to make sense. So, the problem is likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering that the term must also have \\(c^0\\) to not involve \\(c\\). So, the final answer is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which happens when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the product of the relevant coefficients from each part. \n\n1. **First Part**: \\((a + b)^4\\)\n   - The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(k = 2\\) in the binomial expansion.\n   - Coefficient: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Second Part**: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\n   - We need the constant term (exponent of \\(c^0\\)).\n   - This occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0 \\Rightarrow m = 3\\).\n   - Coefficient: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Combine Coefficients**:\n   - Multiply the coefficients from both parts: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Final Answer**: The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I guess I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), right? So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that term will come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because any other term would involve \\(c\\) raised to some power, which would make the entire term have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something, but we just want \\(a^2b^2\\), so \\(c\\) should cancel out. Wait, but is that correct? Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, actually, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is a term like \\(a^kb^{4 - k}\\), and each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(c^m \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^n}\\) or something? Wait, no, more accurately, each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\), where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). Now, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and when multiplied by terms from the second part, which involve \\(c\\), the resulting terms would have \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, unless \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\) is \\(c^0\\), which is 1, the term would not be just \\(a^2b^2\\); it would have some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, to get a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\) (without any \\(c\\) terms), we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero. So, we need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term in the second expansion that will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(m = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\). So, the coefficient from the second expansion is 20. Now, the coefficient from the first expansion for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as we found earlier. So, when we multiply these together, the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by each term in the second part, which are various powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then that's different. Wait, but the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so I think that implies that we are looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). Wait, but that can't be right because in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which has different powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that doesn't quite make sense because each term in the product would have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't make much sense because each term would have different exponents of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a sum over all the coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some \\(c^k\\), but that would not be a single coefficient. Therefore, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion. So, in that case, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. Let me check that again. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), has the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), has the term \\(c^0\\) when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when you multiply these two terms together, you get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) times \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Is there another way that \\(a^2b^2\\) could be formed? For example, if the second expansion had a term that, when multiplied by another term from the first expansion, could result in \\(a^2b^2\\). But no, because the first expansion is only up to \\(a^4b^0\\) and \\(a^0b^4\\), so the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is through the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself from the first expansion multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion. Alternatively, if the second expansion had a term with \\(c^{-2}\\), then perhaps if we multiplied by a term from the first expansion that had \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), but that's not possible because the first expansion doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms. So, I think my reasoning is correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) might not affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials together, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. But in this case, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is a constant term, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because when we multiply by that term, the \\(c\\) part won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Alternatively, if the second part had a term with \\(c^0\\), then when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would just give \\(a^2b^2\\), and the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from both parts. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, it becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term in the second part is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), so when we multiply by the appropriate term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), that term must be \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. That makes sense because any other term from the second part would introduce a \\(c\\) term, which we don't want.

Now, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part as 6 and the second part as 20, we multiply them together. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake.

However, when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we only care about the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each. The exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't matter for this term, so we can consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term would be \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) something with \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, as I thought earlier, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check if I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term becomes \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) times the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it becomes a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and some \\(c\\) term. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating, and the answer is simply 6, because the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that can't be right because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. Wait, but perhaps the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is more straightforward. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think the answer is 384. But let me verify this with another approach. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product of two separate expansions. The first expansion is \\((a + b)^4\\), which we've already determined has a coefficient of 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\). The second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Now, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part contributes a coefficient that multiplies \\(a^2b^2\\). The sum of the coefficients in the second part is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384. I think that makes sense. So, the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The entire expression also includes \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), whose sum of coefficients is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part.

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, does that mean I need to consider all the possible terms where the product has \\(a^2b^2\\), and then sum their coefficients? Wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a single term in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term, and the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), etc. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that can't be right because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term, and when you multiply by the second part, you're getting terms that include \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, perhaps the question is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would include all the possible coefficients from the second part. But that doesn't make much sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that is multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that's not correct either because each term in the second part has a different power of \\(c\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not multiplied by any \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the answer is simply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But wait, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make more sense, as otherwise, the coefficient would just be 6 times 64, which seems a bit large. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, in that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, let me check that approach. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, which means \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the answer should be 120. Wait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which would give a coefficient of 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high, and I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient when considering the entire term, including the \\(c\\) parts. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about the wording: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, i.e., the constant term. So, in that case, the answer would be 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering all possible terms, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The exponent of \\(c\\) is zero when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\).

But wait, the term we're looking for is \\(a^2b^2\\), and that part of the expression doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is for the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Because if I multiply the two parts together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, but we only want the constant term (since we don't have any \\(c\\) terms in \\(a^2b^2\\)). Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Wait, actually, when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply as well. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term, you just get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant, so the coefficient would be 6 times that constant's coefficient. So, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, I need to solve \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from both parts.

The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, would the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) be 6 * 64 = 384? Wait, that seems high. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out to the zero power. Because otherwise, if we just take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion, which would include all powers of \\(c\\). But the problem as stated is: \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" without mentioning \\(c\\). So, maybe the answer is indeed 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But let me check that again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, but that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem didn't specify, so maybe it's just 6 times the sum of coefficients, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking that. Let me try another approach. Let me expand both parts separately and see how they multiply. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) expands to \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Now, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Now, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. In that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero would be when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I'm confused now. Which interpretation is correct? The problem says: \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), in the product, each term will have some power of \\(a\\), some power of \\(b\\), and some power of \\(c\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. Since the problem didn't specify the power of \\(c\\), maybe it's the first interpretation, 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me see if the problem is from a textbook or somewhere; maybe I can infer. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), so the answer would be 120. Let me check again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), that would mean all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. Since the problem didn't specify \\(c\\), I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so the answer is 384. But I'm not 100% certain. Let me think of another way. Suppose I write the entire product as a sum of terms. Each term would be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient from the first part is 6. Then, this is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.

    "text": " Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, but wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), not \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is for the \\(c\\) terms? Wait, no, because the \\(c\\) terms are in the second part, but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6, regardless of the other terms. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the combined expression. Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in \\((a + b)^4\\), and when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), it's like multiplying each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad. Wait, no, actually, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restrictions on \\(c\\). So, maybe the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's not correct either because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not exactly right. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\). When you multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you get \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's not a numerical coefficient; it's an expression involving \\(c\\). Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because coefficients are numerical. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me re-express the problem. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems too high. Let me check that again. Wait, no, that would be if I'm considering all possible terms, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But wait, that seems like a lot. Let me think differently. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in \\((a + b)^4\\), and when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second part. So, that would be 6 \u00d7 \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's not a numerical coefficient; it's an expression. So, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the sum of coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), so 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that we're only considering the constant term in \\(c\\). Wait, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, it would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But let me check that again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me try to approach it differently. Let's consider that \\((a + b)^4\\) is being multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and we need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, which is \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, as we calculated earlier. The sum of all coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. But just to make sure, let me think if there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the entire expression is a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the coefficient of each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is separate. So, when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Yeah, that makes sense. So, I think the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

But wait, that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, each term is combined. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term is only present in \\((a + b)^4\\) and doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be, because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable as well. But that would be more complicated because then you'd have terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) as well. Wait, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the first part, and it would be multiplied by each term from the second part. But since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second part. So, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not correct either. Wait, let me think again. Let me consider that when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each factor. So, in this case, \\((a + b)^4\\) has a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has various terms. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating all variables together. But that seems more complicated. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, when you multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems odd. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because usually, when they ask for the coefficient, they mean the numerical coefficient, treating all other variables as constants. But in this case, since \\(c\\) is in the other part, perhaps the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me try another approach. Let me think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials: \\(P(a, b) = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(Q(c) = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the product is \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\). Now, when you multiply these, each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) has a coefficient of 6, and when multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), it becomes \\(6 \\times\\) each term in \\(Q(c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(Q(c)\\), which is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because coefficients are usually constants. Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). But the sum of coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(Q(1) = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which seems odd. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem specifically says \\(a^2b^2\\), without mentioning \\(c\\). Hmm, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I thought earlier, the sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(Q(1) = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems more like a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a single coefficient. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think differently. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second part. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because coefficients should be numbers. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a separate factor, so the coefficient remains 6. But that seems too simple, and I don't think that's the case. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all variables, but that would require considering terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^k\\) or \\(1/c^k\\), but since the problem doesn't specify any \\(c\\) terms, perhaps it's just 6. Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a separate factor, so the coefficient remains 6.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems like a polynomial, not a number. Hmm, I think I need to clarify this. Let me think about how polynomial multiplication works. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) has a coefficient of 6, and it's multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which is not a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a separate factor, so the coefficient remains 6. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that the second part is a separate polynomial, so the coefficient is 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like the coefficient is a polynomial, which is not a number. I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should look for another approach. Let me think about the entire expression: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I want to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider that term separately from the \\(c\\) terms. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), is another polynomial. When you multiply these two, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6 is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a separate factor, so the coefficient remains 6. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like the coefficient is a polynomial, which is not a number. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think of it differently. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, when you multiply the two polynomials, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present in the product, and its coefficient will be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that still seems like the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a separate factor, so the coefficient remains 6. But that seems too simple, and I think the problem is expecting more. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like the coefficient is a polynomial, which is not a number. Hmm, I'm going in circles here. Let me try to think of an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it's \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1 times (c + 1/c). Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) is 1 times (c + 1/c). So, in this case, the coefficient is a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. But the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which is usually a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a separate factor, so the coefficient remains 6. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. As I thought earlier, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\( (1 + 1)^6 = 64 \\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But I'm not entirely sure if that's correct.

The sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\( (1 + 1)^6 = 64 \\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384. That seems plausible. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like the coefficient is a polynomial, which is not a number. Hmm, I think I need to make a decision here. Given that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not specifying anything about \\(c\\), I think the intended answer is 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, giving 384. So, I'll go with that.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Since the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) and doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), we treat the second part as a separate factor.

So, when I multiply them together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't affect the terms involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second part, because when you multiply by 1 (since the second part is being multiplied by each term), it doesn't change the coefficient. Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), those terms don't affect it. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6, and when multiplied by the second part, which is 1 for the purpose of just the coefficient, it remains 6. Wait, but that seems too simple. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me check. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the second part is also being multiplied, but since it's a separate variable, it doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times whatever the coefficient is from the second part when considering terms that don't involve \\(c\\). But wait, the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the only term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is the middle term, which is 20. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. Wait, that makes more sense. Because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term from the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would include all the terms from the second expansion multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). However, if the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a single polynomial, and they want the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, each term in the expansion would be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) ranges based on the second expansion. But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would involve all the terms from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too high. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, in the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion, which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because if you have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^k\\) and \\(c^{-k}\\), the only way to have a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 0\\), so the term is 20. So, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. That makes more sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Let me verify that. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when you multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, resulting in 6 * 20 = 120.

But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, I think that the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will just be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient will be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that doesn't sound right either. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me approach it differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand this, each term will be of the form \\(a^{4 - k}b^k \\times c^m \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{6 - m}\\) for some \\(k\\) and \\(m\\). Wait, no, actually, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when I multiply this by \\((a + b)^4\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\), so when multiplied by \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\), the term becomes \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need to find all terms where \\(a^{4 - k}b^k = a^2b^2\\), which implies \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and the corresponding coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, the other part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not correct because each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has different powers of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term will have a different power of \\(c\\), but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's actually the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not right either. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), the coefficient will be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), it's like \\(a^2b^2 \\times [ \\text{sum of all terms in } \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 ]\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting 1 for all variables. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, that seems high. Let me check my reasoning again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in thinking that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Maybe it's not that, because in the product, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, which has terms involving different powers of \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's actually the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because for each term in the second part, you're effectively adding a multiple of \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of coefficients from the second part, which is 64, giving 384. But let me think again: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. In this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term from the second expansion, regardless of its \\(c\\) power, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. So, 6 times 64 is 384. But wait, let me confirm this with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we have \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 1 times (c + 1/c), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product is (c + 1/c). But if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\) regardless of \\(c\\), that would be the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 1 + 1 = 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 1 * 2 = 2, which is correct because \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is indeed 2, as in \\(2a c + 2a/c\\) if we factor, but actually, it's \\(a c + a/c\\), so the coefficient is 1 for \\(a c\\) and 1 for \\(a/c\\), but when considering the entire coefficient without considering \\(c\\), it's 2. Wait, but in reality, each term has a different coefficient, but if we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then yes, it's 2. So, in that case, the approach works. So, going back, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term becomes \\(a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\), where \\(m\\) is from 0 to 6. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the answer is simply 6, because the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But that doesn't make sense because the second part is being multiplied, so it should contribute a factor. Wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and when you multiply it by the entire second part, each term in the second part is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me check with another approach. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two polynomials, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), so it's just the product of the coefficients from each part where the variables don't interfere. So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), whose sum of coefficients is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. That would make sense because then it's a specific term. Alternatively, maybe it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^{10}\\) or something like that, but I don't know. Wait, let me check the problem again: it's \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the variables are separate. So, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. So, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). That would make sense because then we're looking for a specific term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, maybe that's what the problem is asking for. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) and ignore the \\(c\\) terms, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't seem right. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should just proceed step by step. Let me first find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I found earlier. Now, the entire expression is this multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating all variables together. So, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of a term that also includes some power of \\(c\\). So, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem only mentions \\(a^2b^2\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would require evaluating \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) at \\(c = 1\\), which would give the sum of coefficients. Let me check that.\n\nWait, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, if I multiply 6 by 64, I get 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 384. But wait, is that correct? Because if I'm considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would involve considering the product of the two expansions. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps the intended answer is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, that would require finding the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which is the constant term. Let me check that. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, perhaps the intended answer is 6 times the entire expansion, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. If the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without mentioning \\(c\\), so perhaps it's 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve considering the product of the two expansions, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps it's expecting 6 times the sum of the coefficients, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check another approach. Let's consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. So, in this case, we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), contributes a factor that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient, and not the variable part, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient to be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would be a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating all variables together, which would require considering the product of the two expansions and finding the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps the intended answer is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still unsure. Let me try to think differently. Let me expand both parts separately and see.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nWhich is:\n\n\\[\nc^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\n\\]\n\nSo, the entire product is:\n\n\\[\n(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4) \\times (c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6)\n\\]\n\nNow, when we multiply these together, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times each power of \\(c\\) will be 6 times the coefficient of that power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nThe sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that might be the case, but I was unsure. Now, by expanding, I see that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 times the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120. But since the problem just says \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's expecting 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's possible that the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but the problem didn't specify, so I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. So, in this case, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), you need to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiply it by every term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is found by taking the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\). Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but wait, the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, let me think. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the first part, and the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded will have terms involving different powers of \\(c\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), does that mean we just take the coefficient from the first part and multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part? Or do we need to consider specific terms from the second part? Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is the product of the two expansions. So, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients combine. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the other, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the expanded product. But wait, does the second part contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), so when you multiply it by any term from the second expansion, it will just be \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, right? Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term will have a coefficient, and all those coefficients will add up to the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, perhaps I need to compute the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). How do I find the sum of coefficients in a polynomial? I remember that the sum of coefficients is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (from the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me double-check that reasoning because sometimes I might be missing something. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and when multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, each term in the second expansion adds a multiple of 6 to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for each \\(k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then I would need to find the term in the second expansion where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. So, I think my initial reasoning is correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me check another approach to be sure. Let me consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when we multiply it by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term will contribute a coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, as calculated before. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. I think that makes sense. Alternatively, maybe I can compute the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and see what the sum of the coefficients is. Let's see, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).

So, maybe the coefficient is just 6, and the rest of the expression involving \\(c\\) doesn't affect it because we're only looking for terms that don't involve \\(c\\). But wait, let me make sure. So, the entire expression is a product of two parts: one involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When you multiply two polynomials together, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that means we're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because \\(c^0 = 1\\), which is a constant.

The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when we multiply the two expressions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the product of the coefficient from the first part and the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, actually, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since the second polynomial doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's just a scalar multiple. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, no, that can't be right because the second part is also a binomial expression, so it's not a single number. Hmm, maybe I need to think differently.

But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first part, and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Wait, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so the only way for the product to have \\(a^2b^2\\) is if we take the term from the first part that's \\(a^2b^2\\) and multiply it by the constant term from the second part. Wait, but the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded will have terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but none of them are constants unless the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, I think I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by that constant term, I'll get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and that constant. So, the coefficient will be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Okay, so first, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to do that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(c\\) equal to \\(6 - 2m\\). We're looking for the term where the exponent is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.

Hmm, but wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, does that mean that the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Or does it? Wait, no, because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all possible terms from the second part that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the first part, and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second part, it would just be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, unless the second part contributes a term that affects \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), which it doesn't, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient remains 6. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. So, the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(6a^2b^2\\), when multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), it would produce terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), and so on, but none of these would affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply, but the variables add exponents. So, in this case, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only present in the first part, and the second part doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, that's not correct either because each term in the second part is a separate term, not multiplied by the same coefficient. Let me clarify. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each of those terms contributes a coefficient that gets multiplied by 6. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Is that right? Let me check. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Since the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when you expand it, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is a coefficient multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), the only way that \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if it's multiplied by a term in the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, let me find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the coefficient from the second part (which is 20), so 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, that contradicts my earlier thought where I thought it was 384. So, which one is correct? I think the second approach is correct because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion, you get \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by 20, so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. The first approach was incorrect because I mistakenly thought that the entire sum of coefficients in the second expansion would multiply the first coefficient, but actually, only the constant term contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, as any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) component, which we don't want. So, the correct coefficient is 120. Let me just double-check this. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a constant term (c^0) with coefficient 20. So, when you multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. Yes, that makes sense. So, the answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, I think I need to consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as well. But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I might not need to consider the entire expansion of the second part, but only the terms that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, actually, no. Because the entire expression is a product of two separate expansions, each involving different variables. The first part is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the terms will be products of terms from each expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would correspond to the term in the first expansion where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs, multiplied by any term from the second expansion. However, since the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), every term in the second expansion is just a constant (with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)) multiplied by powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the second part doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I have \\( (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\) and \\( \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m} \\), then the product would be the sum over all k and m of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} \\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so k = 2. So, the term from the first expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2\\). Now, when we multiply this by the second expansion, which is a sum over m of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient from the first part times the entire sum from the second part. But wait, no, because each term in the product is a combination of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) multiplied by the sum over all m of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), but that can't be right because that would imply the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times 2^6\\), which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But that seems too large. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, actually, when you multiply the two expressions, each term in the product is a term from the first expansion times a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are all terms involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), it just adds another factor to the coefficient. Wait, but the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded has terms with coefficients \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for m from 0 to 6. So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is when we set \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times 64 = 6 \u00d7 64 = 384\\). But wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a separate variable from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 64. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But let me think differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but we're just interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would have to find the corresponding term in the second expansion. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me check that again. Let me think of it as multiplying two polynomials. The first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the second is in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the coefficients for terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by all the terms in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you're effectively scaling the coefficient by all those terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times 2^6 = 6 \u00d7 64 = 384\\). So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a sum of coefficients equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, that seems high. Let me check my reasoning again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), perhaps it's sufficient to just take the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and then note that the other part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by the entire expansion.

So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because each term in the second part contributes a coefficient that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But since the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) part, I think I need to sum all the coefficients from the second part and then multiply by the coefficient from the first part. So, as I calculated earlier, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm wrong, and the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but the problem doesn't specify, it just says \\(a^2b^2\\).

So, I think 384 is the correct answer. But let me try another approach to verify. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) as we found, with coefficient 6.

Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).

So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part.
