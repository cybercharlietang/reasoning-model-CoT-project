    "text": " Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the question is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean I only need to consider the part from \\((a + b)^4\\) and not worry about the other term? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), right? So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, that can't be right because the second part is a separate expansion. Wait, but actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all possible ways that \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way it can appear is if I take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is also done using the binomial theorem. So, it would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the constant term from the second part. That would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me double-check that. So, the first part gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives 20 for \\(c^0\\). When you multiply these together, you get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Hmm, that seems right, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only affected by the constant term in the second expansion because any other term would involve \\(c\\) raised to some power, which would change the term, making it not just \\(a^2b^2\\).

But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when I multiply the two expressions together, the terms involving \\(c\\) won't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).

But the problem is asking just for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, is that right? Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, the coefficients add up. But in this case, since \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) are multiplied together, the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that might not be correct because the problem might be considering the entire product. Wait, no, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part, so the second part's terms would just multiply it by 1, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient remains 6. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me make sure I'm not missing something. Alternatively, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the way it's written, it's only \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be 6 times whatever the constant term is in the second expression, because when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you have to multiply by the entire second expression, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the other variables' terms don't matter. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, no, because in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that can't be right because the sum of the coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\). Wait, but actually, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), so the sum of the coefficients is 64. But does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64? That would be 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me check again. Wait, no, that's not correct because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only one term, and when you multiply it by the entire second expression, each term in the second expression will have a coefficient, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of all those products. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first polynomial and the second polynomial has terms in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term in the second polynomial, the result will be \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{something with } c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only come from the terms where the second polynomial contributes a coefficient without any \\(c\\) terms, i.e., the constant term. Because if the second polynomial has a term with \\(c^k\\) or \\(1/c^k\\), then when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would result in a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), which would not be just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) (without any \\(c\\) terms) is if the second polynomial contributes a constant term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the constant term in the second polynomial. So, first, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the first part gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part has a constant term of 20, so when multiplied together, the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, if I consider the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but only the constant term in the second expansion would result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms would have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factors, which would make them \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or similar, which aren't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, the coefficient is 120. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

In other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, the other part can be considered as a constant multiplier. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's possible that when I multiply by the other expression, I might be adding more terms, but actually, no. Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so when you multiply, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, no, that's not correct either. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But actually, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But that doesn't make sense because the product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply, the coefficients don't add up like that. Instead, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a single coefficient. So, I'm getting confused here. Maybe I need to approach this differently. Let's consider the entire expression: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents for \\(c\\), we get \\(c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need to find all terms where \\(a^{4 - k}b^k = a^2b^2\\). That means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for each such term, we have the coefficient from the second part, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), and the term \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that means we need to sum over all possible \\(m\\) the coefficients from the second part. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term from the second expression, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. But actually, that's not correct because the second part isn't a constant; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expression. But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a number, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expression, you're effectively scaling \\(a^2b^2\\) by the entire second expression. But wait, no, that's not quite right because the second expression isn't just a constant; it's a polynomial. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Wait, no, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without mentioning \\(c\\). So, that suggests that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In other words, we're treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but we just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expression. But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), but that would still require us to consider the entire second expression. I'm getting confused here. Let me try to clarify. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in the entire expansion, we have terms like \\(a^kb^l c^m\\) where \\(k + l = 4\\) and \\(m\\) is determined by the second part. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). So, that means we need to find all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), and sum their coefficients. But wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, when you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient becomes 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a single coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the part that doesn't involve \\(c\\), but that would mean setting \\(c = 1\\), which would make \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384. But I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation. Let me check. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 64 times the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, so 64 * 6 = 384. But is that the correct interpretation? The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, perhaps the answer is 384. Alternatively, if we consider that the coefficient is the same as if we set \\(c = 1\\), which might be a way to extract the coefficient. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting us to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the part that doesn't involve \\(c\\), which would mean the coefficient is 6, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a misstatement, and it's supposed to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). That would make sense. So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That would mean we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That seems plausible. So, let's try that approach. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already found as 6. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's compute that. Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). That makes sense. So, perhaps the problem was intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), but in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which isn't a number. So, I think the intended interpretation is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense. So, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.

But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't affect the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I only need to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we found to be 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that can't be right because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not an expression. Maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right either because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has different powers of \\(c\\), but the problem isn't asking about any specific power of \\(c\\); it's just asking about \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) contributes a factor that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, but if we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not correct because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has different powers of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they would create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). So, if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient be 6 * 64 = 384? But that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). That would make more sense. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That would mean I have to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, let's compute that. To find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the final answer should be 120. Wait, but let me double-check. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when we multiply these two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, including the constant term. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Alternatively, if the problem had been asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), we would have to compute it differently, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's safe to assume they mean the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), which is 120. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiplying it by the coefficient of the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (where \\(k = 2\\)) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\).

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the other part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but actually, no. Because when we multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the other terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, that might not be correct. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand this, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), the other part doesn't affect it. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) would be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which are terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be a term that only has \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\), but the problem might be considering the entire expression, so perhaps we need to consider all possible terms, but wait, no, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables. Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the question is just about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a single number, not a polynomial in \\(c\\). Wait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, meaning the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right either because the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) are specific to each power of \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve considering the entire expansion and finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that might not be correct because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a specific power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems confusing because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and wants the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But how do we find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Well, the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\). So, let's compute \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), because the term with \\(c^0\\) is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which happens when we choose 3 terms of \\(c\\) and 3 terms of \\(1/c\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. Hmm, that seems more reasonable. Wait, so which one is correct? Let me clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) has a coefficient of 6, and it is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, as I calculated earlier. So, 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because each term in the product would have a specific power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then it would be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem doesn't specify a particular power of \\(c\\), I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384. However, another interpretation could be that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the other part, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand the entire expression, each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and is multiplied by each term from the other expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which isn't a single coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and not considering the other part because the other part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients would multiply. Wait, maybe I'm confusing the variables. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^mc^{6 - m}\\), but actually, no, because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expands to terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, each term in the product would be \\(a^kb^{4 - k}\\) multiplied by one of these \\(c\\) terms. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(k = 2\\), so \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each of the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, giving 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct approach. Alternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120, because the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. But since the problem doesn't specify a particular power of \\(c\\), I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so 384 would be the answer. Wait, but let me check with a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\(a \\times c + a \\times 1/c + b \\times c + b \\times 1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), and the coefficient of \\(b\\) is also \\(c + 1/c\\). So, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a\\) in this case, it would be \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial, not a single number. Therefore, in the original problem, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's expecting a polynomial in \\(c\\), which would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem probably expects a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, giving 120. That seems more plausible. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, giving 384. But given that in the simple example, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is a polynomial, I think the problem must be expecting a numerical coefficient, implying that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Let me try to confirm this. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) has a coefficient of 6. Then, in the other part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^3 \\times (1/c)^3 = 20c^0 = 20\\). So, when you multiply these, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, giving a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120 for the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), then it's 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120. Since the problem doesn't specify a particular power of \\(c\\), but just asks for \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's more likely that they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384. However, in many algebra problems, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term in a product, it's often implied that you consider the term with the same variables, meaning that you might be looking for the coefficient when the other variables are set to their respective powers. But in this case, since \\(c\\) is a separate variable, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), which would be 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and not considering the other part. But that seems unlikely because the entire expression is given. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that we're summing over all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, if the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Let me check both interpretations. \n\nFirst interpretation: Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). That would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nSecond interpretation: Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). That would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nGiven that the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying anything about \\(c\\), I think the first interpretation is correct, and the answer is 384. However, in many textbooks, when they ask for the coefficient of a term in a product, they usually consider the term with the same variables, meaning that the other variables are set to their respective exponents. But in this case, since \\(c\\) is a separate variable, it's not clear. To resolve this, perhaps I should look for similar problems. For example, if you have \\((a + b)^n \\times (c + d)^m\\), and you're asked for the coefficient of \\(a^kb^l\\), it's the coefficient from \\((a + b)^n\\) times the coefficient from \\((c + d)^m\\) for the same term, but since \\(c\\) and \\(d\\) are separate, the coefficient would be a product of the two coefficients. But in our case, since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then it would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since it's only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's 384. Wait, but let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in the factors. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and it's multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct approach. Therefore, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), whose sum of coefficients is 64 (found by substituting \\(c = 1\\)). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n$\\boxed{384}$"

So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then that coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that might not be the case. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but without considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe it's just 6, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6*64=384. But wait, that seems too high. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply them together. That seems more likely. So, let me go with that approach.\n\nFirst, as I found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do this, I can use the binomial theorem again. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we multiply the coefficients we found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), so 6*20=120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, when we multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. So, the coefficient would be 6*20=120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem was just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, then it would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient 6*(sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting 1 for all variables, so here, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, 6*64=384. But that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) terms is 384, but that seems too large, and the problem might be specifically asking for \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\). So, I think the correct approach is to consider only the \\(c^0\\) term, making the coefficient 120.\n\nWait, let me check again. The problem says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, perhaps it's considering the entire expression, and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, which includes all possible \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every possible term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64=384. But that seems inconsistent because when you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one part is multiplied by all terms in the other part. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so if you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would be the coefficient in the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so maybe it's considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so 384. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as the entire product, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64=384. But that seems too big, and I think that's not the intended interpretation because usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term, you're considering all variables. So, if the problem had said \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)\", then it's 120. But since it just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", maybe it's considering the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but I think that's incorrect because in the product, each term is a combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, so the coefficient isn't a single number but a polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, let me check again. Let me think about how polynomial multiplication works. If I have two polynomials, say P(a, b) and Q(c), then the product P(a, b) * Q(c) would have terms where each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would be the same as the coefficient in P(a, b) times Q(c), but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in P(a, b), and it's multiplied by each term in Q(c). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) times the entire Q(c). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in c, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is a specific term where the exponent of c is zero. So, that would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Let me take a simpler example. Suppose I have (a + b)^1 * (c + 1/c)^1. Then, expanding, it's (a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c. Now, if I look for the coefficient of a^1b^0c^0, that would be zero because there's no such term. But if I look for the coefficient of a^1b^0, regardless of c, then it's (1)(c + 1/c), so the coefficient is (c + 1/c), which isn't a number. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of a specific term where the exponents of all variables are specified, including c. So, in the original problem, it's asking for the coefficient of a^2b^2, which would imply that the exponent of c is zero, because otherwise, the term would have a c component. So, I think the intended interpretation is to find the coefficient of a^2b^2c^0, which is 120.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1. Find the coefficient of a^2b^2 in (a + b)^4, which is 6.\n\n2. Find the coefficient of c^0 in (c + 1/c)^6, which is 20.\n\n3. Multiply them together: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations. So, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is indeed 6, and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20. So, 6*20=120. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nI think that's the right approach. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the expansion of each part separately and then combining the results.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\)) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes only from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, the other part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, is that right? Hmm, let me think. No, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term from the first part, and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), then when we multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term from the second expression. But wait, actually, that's not correct. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), it will just be multiplied by the entire second expression. Wait, no, that's not quite right either. Let me clarify. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is a single term, and when multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, it will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), that term will only come from the product where the second part contributes a term with \\(c^0\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) would have \\(c^k\\), but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(k\\) must be 0. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me figure that out. Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem, it would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, it's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, that would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, but let me double-check that. So, in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in the second part, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Since when we multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by all terms from the second part, but we're only interested in the term where \\(c^0\\), so it's 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a product of two expansions, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each expansion for the respective terms that contribute to \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, yes, 120 is the correct coefficient.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second.

So, does that mean that the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion? Because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the respective \\(c\\) term. But wait, no, because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, actually, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion would be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), thus contributing to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times that term. But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 in the first part, and when you multiply by the second part, which is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me check that. The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include all the terms from both expansions. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first expansion times the entire second expansion, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, in other words, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is a polynomial in \\(c\\), and the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), not involving \\(c\\). Therefore, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the constant term in the second expansion, because only the constant term would multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) to give a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times a constant. So, if I can find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then multiplying that by 6 would give me the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. That makes more sense. So, let me try that approach. So, first, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find the constant term, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first expansion) times 20 (the constant term from the second expansion), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. When I multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part gets multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, giving \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). That seems correct. Alternatively, if I think about the entire expansion, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), only the constant term in the second part will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, 120 should be the correct coefficient.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Wait, but let me double-check that. Because when you multiply the two expressions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we need to consider all the terms in the second part that are multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). However, in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first part, and when multiplied by any term from the second part, it becomes \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is the exponent from the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) terms, so that would only occur when the second part contributes a \\(c^0\\) term, which is 1. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed the coefficient from the first part (6) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part (20), giving 120. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would have to consider only the term where \\(c^k\\) is present. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms, it's 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.

    "text": " Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), does that affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term? Hmm, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\), so when I multiply the two expansions together, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are independent of \\(c\\). So, when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I might only need to consider the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) because the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part will contribute a term that is separate, but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps we can treat the two parts as separate and multiply their coefficients. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply as well. But wait, in this case, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part, and \\(c\\) is in another. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we need to find all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that are constants, because \\(a^2b^2\\) times a constant would still have the same variables. Wait, but actually, no. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term from the second expansion, say \\(c^k\\), the resulting term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire expression, which includes \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me check again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by some term from the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term on its own, and the second expansion has terms involving \\(c\\), perhaps the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear without any \\(c\\) terms is if it's multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. So, first, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I can find that, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term in the second part. So, let's work that out. First, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when we multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when multiplied together, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, I can think about the entire product: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanding this, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only consider the term in the second expansion that is a constant, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That's the term when \\(m = 3\\), which is 20. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that makes sense. I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

I need to see how this interacts with the first part. Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and this term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), maybe the value of the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but that can't be right because the entire expression is a product. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other part is in \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficients for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not correct because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. However, in this case, the first polynomial only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the coefficient is a number, and the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right either because the terms in \\(c\\) would affect the overall coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating the entire expression as a product, but since \\(c\\) and \\(a\\), \\(b\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not correct because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by each term in \\((a + b)^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is not a single number but an expression involving \\(c\\). That doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. So, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, maybe the problem is considering all terms in the expansion, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient would still be the same. Wait, no, that's not possible because the coefficient is a scalar, while the term \\(a^2b^2\\) could be multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), meaning that we can have any power of \\(c\\) as long as the term has \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not correct because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has its own coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for different \\(k\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then we would need to sum all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. But that would require considering all possible terms, which might not be feasible. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I expand both parts separately, then multiply them together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient. So, the total coefficient would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Now, to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can substitute \\(c = 1\\) because that would make each term equal to its coefficient. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but let me check that again. If I substitute \\(c = 1\\), then yes, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) becomes \\(2^6 = 64\\), which is the sum of all coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Alternatively, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, so 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. That seems correct. So, I think the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together, \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would include terms with \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that might not be correct. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) for each term. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those terms, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only be the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because otherwise, it's not just \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, that makes sense. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\). So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Now, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the middle term when expanded. Let me use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).

Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, when we multiply these two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but only the term where \\(c^0\\) will contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term without any \\(c\\) involved. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). We're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as we found. Now, when we multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these, we get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(15a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(20a^2b^2\\), and so on. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, that's the term \\(20a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 20 times the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, so 6 * 20 = 120. Yes, that makes sense. So, I think the answer is 120.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: when you have two independent variables, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each factor. So, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(c^0\\) is a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is the product of their individual coefficients, which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, yes, that seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes here.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the final coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients of the resulting terms are products of coefficients from each polynomial. So, if I have \\( (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\) and \\( \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m} \\). So, when you multiply these two, you get a double sum: \\( \\sum_{k=0}^4 \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{4}{k} \\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m} \\). Now, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), which we've already determined gives a coefficient of 6. But this term is then multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of coefficients would be \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expression, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Wait, no, the problem just says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expression, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a separate term, so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term becomes \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\), and the coefficient for each of these would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that would mean we're summing over all possible \\(m\\). So, the total coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). And since \\(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\), then the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That would make the problem more involved. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the answer would be 384. But let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, meaning considering all variables. But that doesn't make much sense because \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in multiple terms, each multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for a specific \\(k\\), then we'd have to compute it differently. Since the problem doesn't specify, I think it's the former. So, I think the answer is 384. But let me just go through it again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, first, expand \\((a + b)^4\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has terms \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to 6. The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. That seems correct. Alternatively, if I think about the entire product, each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", but in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient, so perhaps it's just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) when expanded. Wait, but that might not be the case. Let me try to approach this differently.\n\nWait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me try to clarify: when you have two expressions multiplied together, like \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the expansion would be the sum over all possible products of terms from each expansion. So, each term in the product would be of the form \\(a^{k}b^{4 - k} \\times c^{m} \\times (1/c)^{6 - m}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that would correspond to the case where \\(k = 2\\) in the first expansion, giving \\(a^2b^2\\), and for each such term, it's multiplied by a term from the second expansion, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{m} \\times (1/c)^{6 - m} = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{2m - 6}\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first expansion, which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), multiplied by the sum over all possible \\(m\\) of the coefficients from the second expansion. Wait, but no, because each term in the product is \\(a^2b^2\\) times a term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which, when expanded, has terms with coefficients that sum up to the value when \\(c = 1\\). Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) into the second expression gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, each term would be of the form \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{k}\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{-k}\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from the first expansion times the entire expansion of the second expression, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a constant, not a polynomial in \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2 respectively, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would depend on \\(c\\), which isn't specified. So, if that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, let's approach it that way.\n\nSo, first, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found before. Now, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. Because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), I get \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term we're interested in. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by looking for the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. Let me expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem: \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{k} \\left(1/c\\right)^{6 - k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{2k - 6}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(2k - 6\\). We want the exponent to be 0, so \\(2k - 6 = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) times 20 (from the second part), which is 120. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when I multiply these together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, let me think about it another way. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I were to collect like terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all possible terms in the second expansion multiplied by 6. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, that would be 6 times 64, which is 384, as I thought earlier. But that contradicts the previous result of 120. Hmm, so which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify the problem statement again. The problem says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Now, when it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", it's ambiguous whether it's considering terms regardless of the power of \\(c\\) or only the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero. If it's the former, then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. If it's the latter, then it's 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so that would be 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's considering all terms where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit odd because usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term in a product, it's considering the entire term, including other variables. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let's check with an example. Let me compute the product of the two expansions up to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term and see what the coefficient is.\n\nSo, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nAnd \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\).\n\nNow, if I multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times (c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6)\\), which is \\(6c^6 + 36c^4 + 90c^2 + 120 + 90/c^2 + 36/c^4 + 6/c^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), with each term having a coefficient of 6 times the corresponding coefficient from the second expansion. But the problem is asking for \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which is ambiguous. It could either mean the entire polynomial, which is 6 times the second expansion, or it could mean the coefficient when considering all variables, which would be 120, the constant term. But I think the problem is more likely asking for the constant term, i.e., the coefficient when \\(c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in the product, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384, which is a constant, but when you expand the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nI think I'm getting confused here. Let me try to think again.\n\nThe problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that would mean the coefficient is 384, a constant, which seems more likely, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nWait, let's check: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, say \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\), then the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the entire polynomial \\(Q(c)\\). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for \"the coefficient\", which suggests a numerical value. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering the coefficient as a polynomial, but that's less likely. Given that, I think the correct answer is 120. So, I'll go with that.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{6 - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{2m - 6}\n   \\]\n   We need the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0.

But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that would only come from the term where the second factor contributes a coefficient of 1, right? Because if you have \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1\\), that's the term we're interested in. But wait, the second expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the only term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is the constant term, which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the constant term in the second part. So, that would be 6 times 20, which is 120. Wait, let me confirm that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, when you multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part gets multiplied by each term in the second part, but only the constant term (20) will result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. All other terms would have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), which would make them \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), which are not what we're looking for. So, the coefficient we want is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is that the entire expression is the product of two independent binomial expansions. So, when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients from each expansion for the terms that result in \\(a^2b^2\\). Since the second expansion doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and the constant term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

But wait, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is another binomial expansion. But since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think I don't need to consider the second part because it's multiplied by that term, but the variables are different. Wait, but actually, no, because the entire expression is a product of two expansions, so perhaps I need to consider all possible terms when multiplying. Wait, no, actually, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are separate from the \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms. So, when I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and when I expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that term in the product would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some term from the second expansion. But wait, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Wait, no, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, so perhaps they're treating the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and they want the coefficient of the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that in the product of the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every possible term from the second expansion. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part is multiplied by it, but since the variables are different, the coefficient would be the same as in the first part. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion, because each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. But that seems complicated. Wait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, the coefficient would be 6 times whatever coefficient from the second expansion, but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), maybe it's just 6. Wait, but that seems too simple. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's written as \\(a^2b^2\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and ignoring \\(c\\). Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would involve considering all possible terms from the second expansion. Wait, but that seems more involved. Let me try to clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that includes the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make much sense because the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a separate variable. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. But that would be 6 times \\(2^6\\) because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has coefficients that are binomial coefficients, but when you sum all coefficients, you set \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 would be 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is a separate expansion, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient remains 6. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about it differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, you get terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k}\\) multiplied by terms like \\(c^m (1/c)^{6 - m}\\), which simplifies to \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{m - (6 - m)} = a^kb^{4 - k}c^{2m - 6}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so we set \\(k = 2\\), which gives \\(a^2b^2\\). The coefficient for this term in the first expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, in the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when you multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. But wait, that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), giving 384. But that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's the intended interpretation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but without considering \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6, as the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) coefficient. Hmm, I'm confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as a product of two independent expansions. The first expansion gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and the second expansion is a separate polynomial in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire second expansion, meaning that the coefficient would be 6 times each term in the second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a single number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 384. But I'm not entirely sure if that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a separate term that doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But that seems unlikely because the entire expression is a product, so each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire second expansion, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) expanded, and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expanded, then when I multiply them, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that's the coefficient.\n\nBut let me think differently. Maybe the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), so in that case, the coefficient would just be 6, because the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But that seems contradictory because when you multiply by the second expansion, each term in the first expansion is scaled by the entire second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every possible term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a separate factor, so the coefficient remains 6. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients combine. So, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check this with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion would be \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) would be \\(1 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the second part, which would be 6. But that contradicts the initial statement because the entire expression is the product of both parts.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and they're asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion, which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a number, so perhaps they're only considering the coefficient from the first part, which is 6. Alternatively, maybe they're considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. That would make more sense. So, let me try that approach.\n\nSo, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then I need to find the term where in the first expansion, I have \\(a^2b^2\\), and in the second expansion, I have a term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero would be when the exponents from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out. So, in the expansion, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) from the second part, which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, that makes more sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. So, I think that's the correct approach. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering that the exponents of \\(c\\) must cancel out (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), is 120.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. So, in the first expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, when you multiply these two, you get 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. Therefore, the answer is 120.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. For the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), which is correct. For the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero occurs when \\(m = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), which is correct. Therefore, multiplying them gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, yes, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then the answer would be 6, but since the problem includes \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) in the expression, it's more likely that they want the coefficient where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, resulting in a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the correct answer is 120.\n\nWait, but I should check if there's another interpretation. Suppose the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial, but since the problem asks for a coefficient, which is a number, that can't be the case. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nSo, to summarize, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):** The term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero occurs when \\(m = 3\\), giving the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:** \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Or is it possible that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) could be multiplied by some term from the second part, and I need to consider how that affects the coefficient? Wait, no, I think the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps I can treat the two parts separately because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and since the other part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but actually, when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients combine. But in this case, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are separate from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so maybe the coefficient remains the same. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial.

Actually, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when multiplied by \\((a + b)^4\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

When I multiply them together, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can consider that the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, that doesn't seem right because the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is just 6, because the other part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include all possible terms from the second expansion. But that seems more complicated. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I expand each part separately, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will have terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will have terms involving various powers of \\(c\\), but none of them will involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, for example, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when I look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting the variable to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems a bit high.

Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's in the entire product. That means that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term from the second expansion, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the other part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by other terms. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Let me confirm that. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the coefficient being 6, and the other part just being multiplied by 1, but that doesn't make sense because each term is multiplied by each term. So, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me check another way. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is just 6. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes the entire product. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the other part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by other terms. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, the coefficients do combine. Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 = 6a^2b^2 + \\text{other terms}\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\text{some terms}\\), then when I multiply them, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by each coefficient in the second expansion, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. So, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the specific term \\(a^2b^2\\) only comes from the first polynomial, and the second polynomial doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient remains 6, and the other part just adds more terms involving \\(c\\). But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Let me see: if I have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and find its sum of coefficients. Let's do that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for each term. The sum of the coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), which confirms that the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 = 6a^2b^2 + \\text{other terms}\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = 64\\) when \\(c = 1\\), then when I multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 * 64 = 384 because each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, and the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by all 64 terms, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 64.\n\nWait, but actually, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just 6 times the entire second polynomial, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6, but that seems unlikely because the problem includes the entire product. So, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with a smaller example to see if my reasoning is correct. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1 = c + 1/c\\). Now, the product is \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(ab\\), which is 2ab, then when I multiply by \\((c + 1/c)\\), the term \\(2ab\\) will be multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), giving \\(2abc + 2ab/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) in the product is \\(2c + 2/c\\). But if I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(ab\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's not a single number because it depends on \\(c\\). So, perhaps in that case, the coefficient is not a constant but a function of \\(c\\). But in the original problem, the question is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be a constant because the other terms are in \\(c\\). Wait, but in my small example, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is \\(2c + 2/c\\), which is not a constant. So, perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would also involve terms of \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient, which might be interpreted as the entire coefficient expression, not just a numerical coefficient. Hmm, that complicates things.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand it, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part, which are various powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\right)\\), which is \\(6c^6 + 36c^4 + 90c^2 + 120 + 90c^{-2} + 36c^{-4} + 6c^{-6}\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is this entire expression involving \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is this polynomial in \\(c\\). However, perhaps the problem is only interested in the numerical coefficient, ignoring the \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't make much sense because the coefficient would naturally include the \\(c\\) terms. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would be the sum of all the coefficients when considering \\(c\\) as well. But that seems unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the product would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's not correct because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\right)\\), as I wrote earlier. So, the coefficient is that entire expression. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, so perhaps it's expecting a numerical value, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient is in terms of \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is just 6. But that seems inconsistent with the way the problem is phrased.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's not a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient when considering the product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. That seems more plausible because when you set \\(c = 1\\), the sum of the coefficients is 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, I think the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = 64\\), so the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product is 6 * 64 = 384. That makes sense because when \\(c = 1\\), the expression simplifies to 64 times \\((a + b)^4\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 64 * 6 = 384. Therefore, the answer is 384.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe are interested in the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. This corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), giving us:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n\\[\n\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\nWhen multiplying the two expansions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is:\n\\[\n6 \\times 64 = 384\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

But wait, the term we're looking for is \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times whatever comes from the second part when we multiply? Wait, no, because the second part is a separate expansion, so maybe I need to consider the entire expression as a product of two expansions. But actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the part involving \\(c\\) doesn't affect it. Wait, that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product of two terms. So, perhaps I need to consider the product of the coefficients from each part. Let me think again. Let me write the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I expand both separately, then when I multiply them, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term from the first expansion, and it doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient from the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\), but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps it's the product of the coefficients. Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me clarify. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion has a coefficient of 6. Then, when we multiply by the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\) or something like that. So, when we multiply 6 by each term in the second expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). Wait, but in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the sum of all terms in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that would be if we were considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), but actually, in the problem, we're only asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. When we have two expressions multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one expression and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the other, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with those of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\), etc., but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion would be when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\), the second expression becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. It says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which implies that it's looking for the coefficient in the entire expansion, considering all possible terms, but perhaps it's considering only the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, yes, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, but since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by other terms. But that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is the product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times whatever comes from the second expansion when multiplied. Wait, but if I'm only interested in the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then yes, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion without considering the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is just 6, because the other part doesn't affect it. But that seems incorrect because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. So, I think the correct approach is to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all terms, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, 6 from the first part and the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) is in the second, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I expand the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because the problem is only about \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). But that seems unlikely because the entire expression is the product, so the coefficient would be affected by the second part.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, it's the sum of all coefficients for terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) exponents. So, that would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the coefficients multiply as well. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, because \\(c^0\\) is the constant term, which would multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) to give \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because if I want the term \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, I need to multiply it by the constant term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nOkay, so let me calculate the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, going back, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, earlier, I was confused about whether to multiply by the sum of all coefficients or just the constant term. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), we need to find the term in the second expansion that is a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) and multiply it by the coefficient from the first expansion.\n\nSo, step by step:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. We need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. This happens when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. Multiply the two coefficients: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but that was when I considered multiplying by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which would give the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), I think I made a mistake there. Actually, no, because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by the second expansion, it's multiplied by each term, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. But now, I'm confused because I have two different answers depending on the interpretation.\n\nWait, let me clarify the problem statement. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". So, in the entire expansion, we're looking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that we need to consider all terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and the exponents of \\(c\\) can be anything. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we just sum up all the coefficients from the second expansion and multiply by 6. So, that would give 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut now I'm confused because earlier I thought it was 120 when considering only the constant term. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, meaning that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut the problem statement is: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\".\n\nSo, in the context of polynomial expressions, when asked for the coefficient of a specific term, it usually refers to the coefficient when considering all variables. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's likely that it's considering all possible exponents of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nBut now I'm not sure because sometimes problems specify whether they want the coefficient regardless of other variables or considering all possibilities. Let me think again.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's consider the entire expression as a product of two polynomials. When you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of the products of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and each term in the second polynomial. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), each term in the second polynomial is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term, you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient times \\(c^k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum over all \\(k\\) of (6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second polynomial). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), which would be the sum of all those coefficients, which is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify any \\(c\\) terms, so it's ambiguous. However, in the problem statement, it's written as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\", which suggests that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which includes all possible terms with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nBut I'm still not entirely sure because sometimes when problems involve multiple variables, they might be asking for the coefficient of a specific term, considering all variables. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is separate from \\(c\\), perhaps the intended answer is 120, considering only the constant term. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is a separate factor. But that seems unlikely because the entire expression is the product.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for similar problems or think about how coefficients work in products of polynomials. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one polynomial and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the other, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't affect the exponents of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times (1 + 1)^6 = 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut given the problem statement, I think the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still confused because when I think about it, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me check with a smaller example to see if this makes sense. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The first part is \\(a + b\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1. The second part is \\(c + 1/c\\), whose sum of coefficients is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Let's expand the entire expression: \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The terms involving \\(a\\) are \\(ac\\) and \\(a/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) times \\(c\\) is 1, and the coefficient of \\(a\\) times \\(1/c\\) is also 1. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it would be 1 + 1 = 2, which matches 1 * 2 = 2. So, in this case, the approach seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, if I look for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^0\\), it would be the coefficient of \\(a\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. In this case, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 0 because the second expansion has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so no constant term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^0\\) would be 1 * 0 = 0.\n\nWait, but in the earlier example, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 2, so the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product is 2. But the coefficient of \\(a c^0\\) is 0. So, depending on what you're looking for, the answer changes.\n\nIn our original problem, the question is: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)?\" So, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 * 64 = 384. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut in the problem statement, it's written as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying any \\(c\\) terms, so I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), so the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, which is 64, multiplied by 6, giving 384.\n\nBut now I'm not sure because I might be overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to consider that the entire expression is a product, and when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first polynomial, because the second polynomial doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient remains 6.\n\nWait, that makes sense too. Because the second polynomial only has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is just multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nBut in the smaller example, when I had \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) was 2, which is 1 times 2, the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial. So, that seems to support the idea that the coefficient is 6 times 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, after considering all this, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but now I'm doubting myself because I initially thought it was 120, considering only the constant term, but the smaller example suggests that it's the sum of coefficients. So, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nBut let me check again with another example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the first part is 1. The sum of coefficients in the second part is 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Expanding, we get \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\), which gives \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 1 times \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) is 1 + 1 = 2, which matches 1 * 2 = 2.\n\nSimilarly, if I look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0c^0\\), it's zero because there's no constant term in the second expansion. So, that would be 1 * 0 = 0.\n\nTherefore, in the original problem, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, it's written as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without any mention of \\(c\\), so I think it's safe to assume that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit confused because sometimes problems specify whether they want the coefficient considering all variables or just specific ones. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is separate, I think 384 is the correct answer.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has a sum of coefficients equal to \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\).\n\n3. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 120, so I need to resolve this confusion.\n\nWait, another way: Let's consider the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^3\\), then we would have to find the coefficient of \\(c^3\\) in the second expansion and multiply by 6, which would be different.\n\nBut since the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient is 384.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check using another approach. Let's compute the entire product and see what the coefficient is.\n\nBut that would be time-consuming, but perhaps for the specific term \\(a^2b^2\\), we can consider that it's multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, so the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these results gives the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product as \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, so when I multiply the two expansions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, actually, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), then when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because that would make the coefficient a sum of all terms in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be a very large number. But actually, I think I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), when you multiply it by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will have a factor of \\(c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). Therefore, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the result will be terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\), but none of these will be just \\(a^2b^2\\) because they all have some power of \\(c\\). Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that we're considering terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, leaving only \\(a^2b^2\\). But that's not possible because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) only contributes terms with positive and negative exponents of \\(c\\). So, maybe the question is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, it's possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a single term, and when multiplied by the other expression, it would be part of a larger expression. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire product, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's actually a coefficient that's multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because coefficients are numerical factors. So, perhaps the problem is actually miswritten, or I'm misinterpreting it. Wait, let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. That is, when you expand the entire product, you'll have terms like \\(a^kb^lc^m\\) where \\(k + l = 4\\) and \\(m\\) is some exponent from the other expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would correspond to terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be a sum of all the coefficients in that expansion. Wait, but that's not correct because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But that seems a bit off. Wait, no, actually, in the product, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes a coefficient, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by each of those terms, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times each \\(c^k\\) term is the coefficient from the first part times the coefficient from the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's actually considering all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. Because in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a bit ambiguous. Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, let me calculate that. The coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of all coefficients in this expansion, I can substitute \\(c = 1\\). Because when \\(c = 1\\), each term becomes just its coefficient. So, \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, meaning \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, in other words, we need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second expansion. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. Let me see if that makes more sense.\n\nOkay, so let's try that approach. First, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as before. Now, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. To find that, we can use the binomial theorem again. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 20, which is 120. Hmm, that makes more sense because if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, we need the constant term from the second expansion. So, I think this is the correct approach. Let me confirm this logic. When we multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. In this case, we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, and we want it multiplied by the term in the second part that has \\(c^0\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the coefficient would be 6 times 64, which was 384, but that was under the assumption that we were considering all terms, regardless of \\(c\\). But the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which is a bit ambiguous. However, in the context of such problems, it's more likely that they're asking for the coefficient when considering the entire product, meaning that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, if they're asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is \\(a^2b^2\\), then it's 120. So, which is it?\n\nWait, let me think again. The problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would appear multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second expansion is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times each \\(c^k\\) term is the coefficient from the first part times the coefficient from the second part. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's the sum of all these coefficients. So, that would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), then the coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems a bit strange because the coefficient of a term in a product usually refers to the coefficient of that specific term, not the sum of coefficients across multiple terms. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, so 6 times 64 is 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it's \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a\\) times the entire expansion of the second part, so 1 times (1 + 1) = 2. But if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^0\\), then it's 1 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 1. So, depending on whether the problem wants the coefficient considering all powers of \\(c\\) or just the constant term, the answer changes. In the original problem, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, in standard polynomial terms, the coefficient of a specific term includes all possible coefficients from other variables. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 times 64 = 384. However, in some contexts, people might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 times 20 = 120. So, perhaps the problem is ambiguous. But given that the problem is written as it is, I think the more precise answer is 120, because it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that \\(c\\) is not involved, so we're looking for the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check again. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) separately, then multiply them together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, 1, c^{-2}, c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 times 20, which is 120. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), meaning 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would make the coefficient 384. But I'm not sure. Let me think about the wording again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6, a^2b^2c^4, a^2b^2c^2, a^2b^2, a^2b^2c^{-2}, a^2b^2c^{-4}, a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the sum of all these coefficients. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. But that seems high. Alternatively, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. So, I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so the answer is 384. But I'm still a bit unsure. Let me see if I can find a similar problem or think through it differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and since the second part is a separate polynomial, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just 6 times the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the second part. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes the second part in the expression. So, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. So, which is it? Let me try to clarify. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 384. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. So, perhaps the problem is ambiguous, but in most cases, when someone asks for the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) in a product involving other variables, they're considering the coefficient when the other variables are set to a specific value, usually 1, which would mean summing over all coefficients. So, perhaps the answer is 384. Alternatively, if they're asking for the coefficient when considering \\(c\\) as well, then it's 384. But I'm still not entirely sure. Let me try to compute both possibilities and see which makes more sense.\n\nFirst, let's compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. As we found earlier, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nSo, which is it? I think it's more likely that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so the answer is 384. But I'm not 100% certain. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and not considering the second part. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes the second part in the expression. So, I think the correct approach is to consider the entire product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. So, in this case, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first polynomial. Since the first polynomial is \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit confused because I thought earlier that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 120. So, perhaps the problem is asking for that instead. To clarify, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 384. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. Since the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think it's more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so 384. However, I might be overcomplicating it. Let me try to see what the standard approach is.\n\nIn standard polynomial multiplication, when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first polynomial, and since the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\), which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had specified that \\(c\\) must also be raised to a specific power, say \\(c^0\\), then the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. But since it's not specified, I think the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check this with a simpler example to make sure I'm not making a mistake. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Expanding this, it's \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). Now, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in this product is the coefficient of \\(a\\) times the entire expansion of the second part. But in reality, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product is the sum of the coefficients of \\(a c\\) and \\(a/c\\), which would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 2 (since \\(c + 1/c\\) has coefficients 1 and 1, sum is 2). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product is 1 * 2 = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^0\\) would be 1 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 0 because \\(c + 1/c\\) doesn't have a constant term. Wait, no, in this case, \\(c + 1/c\\) does have a constant term if we consider \\(c^0\\), but actually, \\(c + 1/c\\) is \\(c^1 + c^{-1}\\), so the constant term is 0. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a c^0\\) is 0. So, in this example, the coefficient of \\(a^1\\) in the product is 2, while the coefficient of \\(a^1c^0\\) is 0. So, this shows that the coefficient of \\(a^1\\) is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 2. But the coefficient of \\(a^1c^0\\) is 0 because there's no constant term in the second expansion. So, applying this to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384. However, if we were to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, so 120. Therefore, depending on what the problem is asking, the answer could be either 120 or 384. But given the problem's wording, it's more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so 384.\n\nWait, but in the example I just did, the coefficient of \\(a^1\\) in the product is 2, which is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients in the second part. So, applying that logic, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times 64, which is 384. Therefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once more. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a sum of coefficients equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, when you multiply the two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would be 6 * 20 = 120. But since it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm now second-guessing because in the example I did earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^1\\) in the product was 2, which is 1 * 2, where 2 is the sum of coefficients in the second expansion. So, applying that logic, the answer should be 384.\n\nYes, I think that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem is in the form \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm going to check this with a different approach. Let me expand both parts separately and see what happens.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nSecond, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem. The expansion will have terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\), with coefficients as follows:\n\n- \\(c^6\\) term: \\(\\dbinom{6}{0} = 1\\)\n- \\(c^4\\) term: \\(\\dbinom{6}{1} = 6\\)\n- \\(c^2\\) term: \\(\\dbinom{6}{2} = 15\\)\n- \\(c^0\\) term: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\)\n- \\(c^{-2}\\) term: \\(\\dbinom{6}{4} = 15\\)\n- \\(c^{-4}\\) term: \\(\\dbinom{6}{5} = 6\\)\n- \\(c^{-6}\\) term: \\(\\dbinom{6}{6} = 1\\)\n\nSo, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in:\n\n- \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 6c^4 = 36a^2b^2c^4\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 15c^2 = 90a^2b^2c^2\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 120a^2b^2\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 15c^{-2} = 90a^2b^2c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 6c^{-4} = 36a^2b^2c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times c^{-6} = 6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all these coefficients, which are 6, 36, 90, 120, 90, 36, and 6. Adding these together: 6 + 36 = 42; 42 + 90 = 132; 132 + 120 = 252; 252 + 90 = 342; 342 + 36 = 378; 378 + 6 = 384. So, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts and then combine the results.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   To find the sum of all coefficients in this expansion, substitute \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first expansion (6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion (64):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

Does that mean I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms? Hmm, maybe not, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second expression, maybe the coefficient remains the same? Wait, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, no, because when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, the product terms will be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{-k}\\), etc. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that might not be correct because when you multiply, each term in the second expression is a separate term, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so I think I'm misunderstanding something. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't make much sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. Because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense for a numerical coefficient. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term (the term where \\(c^0\\)) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we found to be 6. Then, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's work on that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me double-check. So, in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, but that's not correct because each term in the second expansion has different powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible terms, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which isn't a single number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, without considering the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, let's calculate \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems high. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate variables. But that doesn't seem right either because when you multiply, the coefficients multiply. I'm getting confused here. Let me try to clarify. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in the entire expansion, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or something like that. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that for each term in the expansion where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, we need to sum their coefficients, considering all possible exponents of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so I think I must have misinterpreted the question. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then we're looking for a specific term. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which we found earlier to be 20. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. That seems more reasonable. So, to confirm, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120, considering only the term where \\(c^0\\). Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that doesn't result in a single number. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"
