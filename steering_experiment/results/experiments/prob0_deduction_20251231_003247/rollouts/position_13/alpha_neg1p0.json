    "text": " \n\nNow, the expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm trying to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part, so I guess the second part can be considered separately since it's multiplied by the first part. Wait, but actually, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply these two, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), I think that the part involving \\(c\\) will just contribute a coefficient, and since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe we can consider the other part as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, but actually, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But in this case, since the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), and the first part is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the terms won't interfere with each other. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit odd because the entire expansion of the second part is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), but we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, that would mean that when you expand the entire expression, you're looking for the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), and the rest can be any power of \\(c\\). But since the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part, because each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2(1/c)^k\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of all coefficients from the second part. \n\nWait, but is that correct? Let me test that idea. Suppose I have two expressions, \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\). Then, \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\) would have terms where each term in \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). Because when you multiply, each term in \\(P\\) is scaled by each term in \\(Q\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would include all possible scalings from \\(Q(c)\\). But since \\(Q(c)\\) could have multiple terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of the coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). \n\nWait, but actually, no. Because when you expand \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\), each term in \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) times the entire expansion of \\(Q(c)\\), but since \\(Q(c)\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) times the entire \\(Q(c)\\), because \\(Q(c)\\) doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\((\\text{coefficient of }a^2b^2 \\text{ in } P(a, b)) \\times Q(c)\\). But since \\(Q(c)\\) is a polynomial, when you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just the coefficient from \\(P(a, b)\\) times the entire \\(Q(c)\\). But that seems a bit confusing because \\(Q(c)\\) is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), but we're treating it as a scalar multiple. Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem just says \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2(1/c)^k\\), but since the problem only asks for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the sum over all possible \\(k\\) of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would actually be the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is the same as evaluating the polynomial at \\(c = 1\\). \n\nWait, yes, that makes sense. The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\). So, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times 64. Since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier, then 6 times 64 is 384. So, the coefficient would be 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in one expression is multiplied by all terms in the other expression. So, if I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6 \\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\((c + 1/c)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\((c + 1/c)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient, not the variables, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, so 384. \n\nWait, but maybe that's not the right approach. Let me try a different angle. Let me expand both parts separately and see how the coefficients work. \n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. \n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k\\) from 0 to 6. \n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\) for each \\(k\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, effectively, we're summing over all the coefficients from the second expansion and multiplying by 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nAs I thought earlier, the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients is 64. \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct. Another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), it becomes 6 times that entire polynomial. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is indeed 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that each term in the product will have the form \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\), and the coefficient for each such term is 6 times \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the total coefficient would be the sum over all \\(k\\) of 6 times \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But that's the same as 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to 6, which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), so again 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure that I'm not making a mistake here. Because sometimes when you have multiple variables, you have to consider cross terms, but in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second part, the cross terms don't interfere. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the product of the coefficients from each part, considering that the second part is being treated as a scalar multiple when considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. \n\nWait, but actually, the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so it's not a scalar, but when you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), you're effectively summing over all possible coefficients from the second part. So, yes, that would be the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, multiplied by 6, giving 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is the same as evaluating the second part at \\(c = 1\\), so 6 times 64 is 384. \n\nWait, but let me check this with a smaller example to make sure I'm not making a mistake. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\) would expand to \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the first part is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. But looking at the expansion, the terms with \\(a\\) are \\(ac\\) and \\(a/c\\), so the coefficients are 1 and 1, summing to 2, which matches. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b^1\\) would also be 1 * 2 = 2, which matches \\(bc\\) and \\(b/c\\). So, that seems to check out. \n\nAnother example: \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). Expanding, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). The sum of coefficients in the second part is \\(1 + 2 + 1 = 4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the product would be 1 * 4 = 4, which is correct because the terms would be \\(a^2c^2\\), \\(a^2*2\\), and \\(a^2*1/c^2\\), each with coefficients 1, 2, and 1, summing to 4. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2 * 4 = 8, which matches the expansion: \\(2ab c^2 + 4ab + 2ab/c^2\\), coefficients 2, 4, 2, summing to 8. \n\nSo, this method seems to work. Therefore, applying it to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Another way to approach this is to realize that when you have two independent variables, the coefficients multiply. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the sum of its coefficients is just evaluating it at \\(c = 1\\), which is 64. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, I'm confident that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " Okay, so that's the first part. Now, the expression also has another part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider this as well. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient is just 6, and the other part doesn't affect it? Hmm, maybe not. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, actually, the entire expression is a product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them, each term from the first expansion gets multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps we can consider that term separately and see how it interacts with the other expansion. Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when multiplied by terms from the second expansion, which involve \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the only way to get a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms would be if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term in the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\), which is just 1. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. Let me check that. So, the first part gives me \\(6a^2b^2\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have a term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find that, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the first part gives me \\(a^2b^2\\) with a coefficient of 6, and the second part gives me a term with \\(c^0\\) which is 1, with a coefficient of 20. So when I multiply these together, the term becomes \\(6a^2b^2 * 20c^0 = 120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is indeed 120. But wait, is that all? Because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and since the second part only contributes a constant term when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), that's the only term that affects it. So, yeah, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break it down as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Wait, no, because the entire expression is a product of two parts, so when you multiply them, the coefficients get multiplied as well. Wait, but actually, I think I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), maybe we can treat the second part as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), and we're to find the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\) don't matter? Or perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient when considering all possible terms, but focusing only on \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as the product of two separate binomial expansions and find the coefficient where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but in that case, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each expansion. Wait, no, because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term would come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and every possible term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But then, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which would result in a sum of terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering the entire coefficient, which would be the product of 6 and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression as a product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", implying a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only interested in the coefficient when considering \\(a^2b^2\\) and any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be the same as evaluating the second expression at \\(c = 1\\), because that's how you find the sum of coefficients. Let me check that: If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), so the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems a bit high. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, which is indeed 64, so 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But wait, is that correct? Because in the product, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, which is 64, so 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting a different approach. Let me try another way. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), so when multiplying, the coefficient would just be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that could make sense because if I'm looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, that would make the term independent of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the middle term of the expansion, which is when the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out. Let me check that. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). To find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Hmm, that seems more reasonable. So, perhaps I was wrong earlier when I thought the coefficient would be 384. Instead, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), but perhaps it's considering the entire term, including \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but the problem statement isn't clear. Wait, but the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which implies that it's looking for the coefficient in front of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But if the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the \\(c\\) terms, then perhaps it's the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Alternatively, if it's looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Hmm, I'm a bit confused now. Let me try to clarify the problem statement. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Alternatively, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. But the problem didn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But wait, let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient becomes 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a number. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient, which should be a number. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20, so 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible exponents of \\(c\\). But then, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a single number. So, maybe the problem is actually miswritten, or perhaps I'm misinterpreting it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and not considering the other part. But that seems unlikely because the other part is explicitly given. Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Let me try to approach it differently. Let me consider the entire expression as a product of two polynomials. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) expands to terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expands to terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When you multiply these two, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and is multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which should be a number, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire product as a single polynomial, but only looking at the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Alternatively, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Hmm, I think I need to clarify this. Let me check an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). So, expanding, it's (a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c. The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is c + 1/c, but if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) times any power of \\(c\\), then it's the entire expression c + 1/c. But if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^0\\), then it's zero because there's no such term. Alternatively, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) irrespective of \\(c\\), then it's c + 1/c, which is a polynomial. But in the problem, it's asking for the coefficient, which is usually a number, so perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. That makes more sense because it's a single number. So, I think that's the correct approach. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought of 384, but that was when considering all coefficients in the second expansion. So, to be precise, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which, if considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 times 20, which is 120. Since the problem didn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), it's ambiguous. However, in most problems like this, unless specified otherwise, they usually ask for the coefficient of a specific term, considering all variables. So, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But that seems more involved. Hmm, I'm a bit confused, but I think the more reasonable answer is 120 because it's a single numerical coefficient. So, I'll go with that.\n\nBut wait, let me check again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's not specifying any particular power of \\(c\\), so perhaps it's indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a number. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. So, in that case, the coefficient is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20, so 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Therefore, the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me think of another approach. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible exponents of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But that seems high, and the problem is likely expecting a single numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. So, perhaps the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Therefore, I think the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me confirm by expanding both expressions. Let me first expand \\((a + b)^4\\) up to \\(a^2b^2\\). So, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Now, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the terms are \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20c^0\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. So, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial, but the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so that can't be. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nSo, to sum up, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1.

    "text": " Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I suppose I need to expand this as well. But wait, since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they don't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Is that right? Let me think. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and then I multiply it by any term from the second part, that term will have factors involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, wait, does that mean that the \\(c\\) terms will just multiply into the coefficient, but the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't be affected? Let me make sure. So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some term involving \\(c\\), like \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), the resulting term will still be \\(a^2b^2\\) times that \\(c\\) term. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think I just need to consider the product of the coefficients from both expansions. Because any term in the second expansion will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then when I expand it, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, each contributing a coefficient. Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient from \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient just gets multiplied, and the \\(c\\) part just tags along, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we can sum all the coefficients from the second expansion and multiply by the 6 we found earlier. Wait, that seems a bit off. Let me check. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the \\(c\\) terms are separate, perhaps the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients from each expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, because that would be the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), but wait, no, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term in the second expansion, it's still \\(a^2b^2\\) times something with \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), does that mean we're considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the \\(c\\) part? So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient times \\(c^k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), because that makes each term equal to its coefficient. So, let's compute that. The second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I set \\(c = 1\\), then each term becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, that seems high. Let me verify. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. But the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that any term in the expansion that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider only the constant term in the second expansion, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because otherwise, the term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's implied that \\(k = 0\\). Let me check that. So, if that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which means \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 20 = 120. But wait, the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, now I'm confused. Which interpretation is correct? Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), contribute to the coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. But I'm not sure because sometimes problems like this expect you to consider only the constant term, but the problem didn't specify that. Let me think about it differently. If I expand the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, each of which has a coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient to the product when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that would make the coefficient 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 * 20 = 120. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's 384. Wait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a sum of terms like \\(c^6, 6c^4, 15c^2, 20, 15c^{-2}, 6c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\). So, when I multiply these two, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each of these terms, resulting in \\(6a^2b^2c^6 + 36a^2b^2c^4 + 90a^2b^2c^2 + 120a^2b^2 + 90a^2b^2c^{-2} + 36a^2b^2c^{-4} + 6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). So, in this expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120, because that's the term where \\(c^0\\). But wait, that's not correct because in the entire product, each of those terms is present, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, if that's the case, then the coefficient would actually be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Because each term in the second expansion is contributing a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the example I just did, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But in the expanded form, I can see that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each coefficient, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. However, in my earlier expansion, I saw that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120, which is different. So, perhaps the problem is ambiguous. But since the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me try another approach. Let me consider the entire expression as a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). When you multiply them, the variables are independent, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial contributes its coefficient to the product when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that would mean the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, I think the answer is 384. But wait, let me confirm by actually computing the product. Let me take \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\). Now, when I multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in \\(6a^2b^2c^6 + 36a^2b^2c^4 + 90a^2b^2c^2 + 120a^2b^2 + 90a^2b^2c^{-2} + 36a^2b^2c^{-4} + 6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). So, looking at this, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120 only if we're considering the term where \\(c^0\\). But if we're considering all terms with \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients attached to \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6*(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6*64 = 384. But in the expanded form, each of those terms is separate, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384 because each of those terms is a distinct term with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would be 120. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's 384. So, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in the second expression is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. So, when I multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply term by term. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, we need to consider all the terms where the product results in \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would give terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{-k}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. Actually, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so any terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\) would contribute to the coefficient. Wait, but that can't be right because \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, so \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\) are different terms. So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Hmm, but that's not standard. Usually, when you ask for the coefficient of a specific term, you mean the term that is exactly that, without any other variables. So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). Wait, that might not make sense because \\(c\\) is separate. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the terms where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power, so that the term is just \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Since \\(c\\) and \\(a\\), \\(b\\) are independent variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only appear if the second part contributes a \\(c^0\\) term, because otherwise, you'd have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), which are different terms. So, to get exactly \\(a^2b^2\\), you need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, I need to find both coefficients and then multiply them together. I already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k - k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, multiplying the two coefficients together: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times 20 (from \\(c^0\\)) gives 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), gives 20 for \\(c^0\\). So, when I multiply these together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. Alternatively, if I consider the entire product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by all the terms in the second part, but only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, that's why we need to multiply by the constant term. Yeah, that makes sense. So, I think I did it right. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms because they are separate variables. Wait, no, that's not quite right.

So, maybe I need to consider that when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), the \\(c\\) terms will just be multiplied by that coefficient, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe the answer is just 6 times whatever the entire \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part is. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps the \\(c\\) terms don't affect it. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(6 a^2b^2 c^6\\), \\(6 a^2b^2 c^4\\), etc., depending on how the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expands. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all the coefficients from the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion multiplied by 6. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term would have a different power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not the case. Let me clarify: in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, in the expanded product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too high. Let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, so each term in the product would be of the form \\(a^k b^{4 - k} c^m\\) or something like that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only be present in the product if the corresponding term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a constant term, because otherwise, you can't have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a non-constant \\(c\\) term. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, actually, in the product, each term would have \\(a^k b^{4 - k}\\) times \\(c^m\\) or \\(c^{-m}\\) from the other expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from \\(k = 2\\) in the \\((a + b)^4\\) expansion, which is 6, and then multiplied by each term in the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But as I calculated before, the sum of coefficients is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. But that seems too large. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) terms, but the coefficient is just the numerical factor in front of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) exponents. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times each term in the expansion, but that doesn't make sense because each term in the expansion has different powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, meaning that we have to consider the entire product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is phrased differently, and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, but that would require more specific information. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try another approach. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already determined has a coefficient of 6. Now, when we multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(6 a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in the product will be \\(6 a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times \\((1 + 1)^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me check again because that seems high. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem, and it's only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times each term in the expansion, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a single coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that the product is a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\), and we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and since the other part is multiplied by it, the coefficient remains 6. But that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient would be multiplied by the expansion of the other part. Wait, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is just context. But the problem says \"in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\", so I think it's the entire product. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, so 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is irrelevant. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes the other part. Wait, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and the question is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. That would make more sense. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). Let me try that approach. So, if that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the product. So, first, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, let's find that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the answer would be 120. Wait, that makes more sense. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it would be 384, but that seems too large. Given that, I think the intended question is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), which is 120. Let me verify that. So, to recap: \\((a + b)^4\\) has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\). \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a constant term of 20. So, multiplying these together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\), is 120. So, that must be the answer. Therefore, I think the correct answer is 120.\n\nBut wait, to make sure, let me go through it again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's not explicitly stating anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in that case, each term in the product would have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. As I calculated earlier, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too high, and I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be only about \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other part is just a distraction, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, meaning that we need to consider the entire expansion and find the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is raised to some power. But since the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a single coefficient. Therefore, the only logical conclusion is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120. So, I think the answer is 120.\n\nWait, to confirm, let me consider that when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), down to \\(c^{-6}\\). Therefore, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6 * 1 (since the coefficient of \\(c^6\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 1), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 6 * 6 (since the coefficient of \\(c^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{1} = 6\\)), and so on. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would be the sum of all these coefficients multiplied by 6. But that's not how coefficients work in a product; each term is separate. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6, \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 36, \\(a^2b^2c^2\\) is 60, \\(a^2b^2\\) (constant term) is 60, \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\) is 36, \\(a^2b^2c^{-4}\\) is 6, and \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\) is 1. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, no, the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) are: for \\(c^6\\), it's 1; \\(c^4\\) is 6; \\(c^2\\) is 15; \\(c^0\\) is 20; \\(c^{-2}\\) is 15; \\(c^{-4}\\) is 6; \\(c^{-6}\\) is 1. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6 * 1 = 6; \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 6 * 6 = 36; \\(a^2b^2c^2\\) is 6 * 15 = 90; \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120; \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\) is 6 * 15 = 90; \\(a^2b^2c^{-4}\\) is 6 * 6 = 36; \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\) is 6 * 1 = 6. So, each of these terms has a different power of \\(c\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) alone (i.e., \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)) is 120. Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the 0 power, then it's 120. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but that's not what the problem is asking. Therefore, I think the intended answer is 120.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) to find the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3.

However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Wait, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first expansion, because the second expansion doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms? Let me think. When I multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include all possible combinations of terms from both expansions. But in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion, which doesn't make sense because the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Wait, no, actually, the second expansion is separate. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that means we're looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by all possible terms from the second expansion. But the coefficient would then be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second expansion. Wait, that can't be right because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for a numerical coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to approach it differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all variables, when we expand the entire expression, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{m - 6}\\) or something like that. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, essentially, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would give us a term with \\(c^0\\), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\). Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other factor is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a single number. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a number. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible combinations of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a sum over all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because the coefficient should be independent of \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps the problem is only considering the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product. That would make sense. So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense because when you multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, and the only term that will result in \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is when it's multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion. So, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do that, I can use the binomial theorem again. \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part. \n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   - The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\) in the binomial expansion.\n   - Coefficient: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   - We look for the constant term (\\(c^0\\)), which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), giving \\(m = 3\\).\n   - Coefficient: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Combining the coefficients**:\n   - Multiply the coefficients from both expansions: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer**: \\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

That seems like it would affect the overall expression, but maybe the question is only concerned with the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the other factors involving \\(c\\) would just be multiplied by 1, or perhaps their coefficients don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me make sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm supposed to consider the entire product, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the product of the coefficients from each part.

But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term involving \\(c\\), you'd get a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something, which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, you need to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part by the term in the second part that has \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term. \n\nSo, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already found to be 6. Now, we need to find the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).

That makes me think that maybe the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't depend on \\(c\\), so perhaps I don't need to consider the second part at all? Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Because the entire expression is a product of the two parts, so when I multiply them, each term in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part.

So, does that mean that the coefficient from the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Wait, no. Wait, actually, when we multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all the terms in the second part that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), don't change the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts. That is, the terms in the second part that are constants, because if they have any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), then when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they would create terms with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which aren't part of \\(a^2b^2\\).

Let me write that out: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(6 - 2m\\).

Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second part of the expression, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficients for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in the first part are independent of the second part.

Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. Actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first expression, and the second expression is in terms of \\(c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product will just be \\(a^2b^2\\) times whatever term comes from the second expansion. But since we're only asked about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, does that mean we just take the coefficient from the first part and multiply it by the entire second expansion? Wait, no, that's not correct because the coefficient would actually be the product of the coefficients from both parts. But since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. But wait, that doesn't seem right either. Let me clarify. Let me denote the first part as \\(P = (a + b)^4\\) and the second part as \\(Q = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the product is \\(P \\times Q\\). Now, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(P\\), and when I multiply \\(P\\) by \\(Q\\), each term in \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) has terms only in \\(c\\), the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(Q\\), because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(Q\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), each with their own coefficients. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(Q\\), each term in \\(Q\\) has its own coefficient, and \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term without \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\(P \\times Q\\) is actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) multiplied by the entire sum of \\(Q\\), but that's not right either because \\(Q\\) is a separate variable. Wait, I'm getting confused here. Let me approach this differently. Let's consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms in each polynomial that multiply together to give that specific term. In this case, we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) only appear in \\(P\\), and \\(c\\) only appears in \\(Q\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\(P\\) and multiply it by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) from \\(Q\\). Because if you take any other term from \\(Q\\), which has \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), it would introduce a \\(c\\) term into the product, making the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem is just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(Q\\). That makes sense. So, I need to find two things: 1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P = (a + b)^4\\), which we already found to be 6. 2. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(Q = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Once I have both, I can multiply them together to get the final coefficient. So, let's focus on finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(Q\\). The expression \\(Q = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because we're looking for \\(c^0\\). So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(Q\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\(P \\times Q\\) is the product of the coefficients we found: 6 (from \\(P\\)) and 20 (from \\(Q\\)). So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\(P\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), correct. In \\(Q\\), to get \\(c^0\\), we need the term where the exponent is 0, which occurs when \\(k = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), correct. Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. That seems right. Alternatively, if I think about the entire product, each term in \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(Q\\), but only the constant term in \\(Q\\) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. All other terms in \\(Q\\) would introduce a \\(c\\) term, making the product term have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't what we're looking for. Therefore, only the constant term in \\(Q\\) contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, yes, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. I think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\).

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, why \\(c^0\\)? Because when we multiply the two expansions, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we don't care about the \\(c\\) terms, right? So, to get the overall term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to multiply it by the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because that way, the \\(c\\) terms won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is what I need to find. Let me think about that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the one with \\(c^0\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. Yeah, that seems correct.

I'm supposed to multiply this by \\((a + b)^4\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms? Wait, no, actually, when multiplying two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the \\(c\\) terms don't affect that part. Let me think. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) will multiply with the terms in \\((a + b)^4\\). But since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficients from the \\(c\\) part just multiply the coefficients from the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) part. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that can't be right because the entire expression is a product of two polynomials. So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part would be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, we need to consider how the \\(a^2b^2\\) term interacts with the second expression. Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when we multiply it by terms from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the second expression will have some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), perhaps we need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that is \\(c^0\\), because only then will the product \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) give a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, let me break this down. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\), and that's the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) when multiplying by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find two things: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nI already found the first part: it's 6. Now, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem for this. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent on \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the exponent to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the one with \\(c^0\\). The coefficient for this term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, since we're multiplying the two expressions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients we found. That is, 6 (from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term) multiplied by 20 (from the \\(c^0\\) term). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's 6. Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is when \\(c^0\\), which is 20. So, when we multiply these together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by 20, giving 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. Alternatively, I could think of it as each term in the product being the product of terms from each expansion. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is 6a^2b^2, and the \\(c^0\\) term is 20, so their product is 6 * 20 a^2b^2, which is 120a^2b^2. So, yeah, the coefficient is 120. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by multiplying the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

That is, when I multiply the two expansions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by some term from the second part, but since the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as the coefficient from the first part, because the second part's terms won't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).

But wait, that doesn't make sense because the second expansion has multiple terms, so how does that affect the coefficient? Wait, no. Actually, when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply. But in this case, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is a single term, and when multiplied by the entire second expansion, each term in the second expansion will create a new term in the product. However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, any term from the second expansion that has non-zero exponents of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term because they don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Wait, that's not correct. Let me clarify. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), etc. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that means we're looking for the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out, i.e., where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in other words, we need to find the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because only that term, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will result in a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and no \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already did as 6. Now, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do this, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying the exponents, this becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We are looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part).

I'm supposed to multiply this with \\((a + b)^4\\), so the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the question is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) terms are in the second part, when I multiply the two expansions, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will multiply with the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider that when I multiply the two expansions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will multiply each term in the second expansion. But wait, actually, no. Wait, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial multiplies each term in the second polynomial. But in this case, the first polynomial is \\((a + b)^4\\), which has terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), etc., and the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which has terms involving \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^5 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c}\\), etc. So, when I multiply them, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will multiply each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps I can consider that the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by the entire second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second part. Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Wait, actually, no. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all terms in the second part. But that can't be right because the second part has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you'd get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only come from the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) raised to some power and not just \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, that makes sense. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would only appear if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by the term \\(c^0\\) from the second part. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6. So, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, let me find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the exponent to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) times 20 (from the second part), which is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\) from the second part, which is 20. So, 6 * 20 is indeed 120. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expansion as the product of two separate expansions, and when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each expansion for the respective terms that multiply to give \\(a^2b^2\\). Since the second expansion doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by the \\(c^0\\) term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by multiplying the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1.

But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the variables involved are \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Or is there a part where the terms from the second expansion might affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Wait, no, because \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all different variables. So, when you multiply two polynomials, the terms are multiplied together, but since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are distinct, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if you take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by any term from the second part. But since the second part doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, but that can't be right because the entire expression is a product of two separate expansions. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, every term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the second expansion has terms with \\(c^k\\) and \\(c^{-k}\\), none of those will affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that seems like it would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think is just a numerical coefficient, not considering \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire expression and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But that might not make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is separate from \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me re-express the entire problem. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two expressions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the sum of all these coefficients multiplied by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\). Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because coefficients are typically numerical. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expansion, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients from each part, but that doesn't seem right either because each term in the product would be a combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). Wait, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But I'm not sure. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be a term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But that seems a bit odd because the coefficient is usually a numerical factor. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), meaning that it's just the product of the coefficients from each part. But that doesn't seem right either because the terms from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would affect the overall coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the product of the coefficients from each part. Since \\((a + b)^4\\) has a coefficient of 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a total of... Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part, but that's not possible because the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. That is, the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero. Because then, that term would be a pure number multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\). That makes more sense. So, let me re-express the problem as: Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That would make sense because then we're looking for a term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power, effectively a constant term. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply those two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product. Okay, that seems more reasonable. So, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Now, since the entire expression is the product of the two expansions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, that's \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (assuming they mean \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)) is 120. Let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(k = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. So, yes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by expanding each part separately and then multiplying the relevant coefficients. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20.\n3.

Therefore, the only way that happens is if the term from the second expansion is \\(c^0\\), which is 1.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps I just need to consider that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you multiply out the entire expression, collect like terms, and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would contribute a coefficient that gets multiplied by 6, and since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we have to sum all those contributions. But that seems a bit tricky. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too high. Let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make more sense, because otherwise, the coefficient would involve terms with different powers of \\(c\\), which doesn't make much sense as a single coefficient. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). So, that would mean I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term, and then multiply that by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. So, let's try that approach. First, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the constant term, we can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) times 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Let me make sure I did that correctly. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which happens at \\(k = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. Alternatively, if I consider that the entire expression is the product of two expansions, and I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second expansion, but that would be 6 * 64 = 384, which is different. But that approach seems incorrect because the problem likely wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), but more accurately, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). So, I think the correct approach is to find the constant term in the second expansion and multiply it by the coefficient from the first expansion. Therefore, the answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. This happens at \\(k = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these results gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6 in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider how the terms from each expansion multiply together. But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I don't need to consider the terms involving \\(c\\) at all? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), right? So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6, because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion will multiply by each term in \\((a + b)^4\\). But since we're only interested in the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, the corresponding term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) could be any term, but since it's multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a constant with respect to \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient just remains 6. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be, because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), so maybe I'm misunderstanding something. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because if you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which can have terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would require the \\(c\\) terms to cancel out, meaning the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, perhaps I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, and then multiply that by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\). That makes more sense. So, let me break it down. First, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because when I multiply that term by \\(a^2b^2\\), the result will be \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant term, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 times the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(k = 3\\) is the constant term. So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\n\\(\\boxed{120}\\)"
