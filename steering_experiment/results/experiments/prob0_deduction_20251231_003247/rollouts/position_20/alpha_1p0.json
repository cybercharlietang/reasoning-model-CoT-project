    "text": " Because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the part involving \\(c\\) doesn't affect that term. Wait, actually, no. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in \\((a + b)^4\\), and when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe that term is only present in \\((a + b)^4\\) and when multiplied by the second expression, it just gets scaled by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Oh, perhaps I'm supposed to treat \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) as separate variables, so the expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by the entire second part, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like it's not a constant coefficient; it's an expression involving \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term, you might need to consider whether the other variables are involved. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just considering the coefficients in the product, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that's the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, no, because \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) are separate, so when you multiply them, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. Wait, that might make sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, that seems plausible. Let me check that again. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64 because when \\(c = 1\\), it's \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, when you multiply the two expressions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. So, I think that's the answer. But let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Alternatively, maybe I should think about it differently. If I consider the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's not a numerical coefficient, it's an expression. So, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient in the combined expression, which would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a number, not an expression. Therefore, maybe my initial thought was correct that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have \\(a^2b^2\\) as a term, and the rest of the expression is just a scalar multiple, so the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expression. But that seems inconsistent because the second expression is not a scalar; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). Hmm, I'm a bit confused now. Let me try another approach. Let's expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when we multiply this by \\((a + b)^4\\), which has a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, the resulting term in the product would be \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), because each term is \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first polynomial, and the second polynomial is being multiplied in its entirety, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), because each term in the second polynomial is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But the sum \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\) is equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). That makes sense because the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, so when you multiply by 6, you get 384. So, I think that's the correct answer. To recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these results gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{384}"

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

So, maybe the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will have a coefficient that is 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad.

But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times whatever the coefficient is for each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem doesn't specify any constraints on \\(c\\), so maybe the answer is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not correct because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), but that's not what we need here. Let me try another approach. Maybe I should consider that when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient equal to 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible terms involving \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because coefficients are usually constants, not expressions involving variables. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the numerical coefficient, treating \\(c\\) as a variable and not worrying about its expansion. Wait, but that doesn't make much sense because \\(c\\) is part of the expression. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, when you multiply out the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient that is a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that seems too broad. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient when considering \\(a^2b^2\\) times some terms in \\(c\\). But I'm getting confused here. Wait, maybe I should think of it as two separate expansions: first, expand \\((a + b)^4\\), which gives terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and then expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which gives terms involving \\(c\\). Then, when you multiply them together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is 6\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6. But that seems to be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is a bit unusual for a coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting just the numerical coefficient, treating \\(c\\) as a constant. But that doesn't make much sense either because \\(c\\) is a variable. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. But that's not what's stated. Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is \\(6\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems too involved, and I don't think that's what the problem is asking for. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some terms in \\(c\\), but without more context, it's hard to tell. Wait, maybe I should consider that the entire expression is a product, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too straightforward. Wait, let me check that again. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 * 64\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in that would be 6 * 64 = 384. But is that correct? Because when you set \\(c = 1\\), you're essentially evaluating the coefficient at \\(c = 1\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient in the general case, not evaluated at a specific value. So, maybe that approach isn't correct. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be \\(6(c + 1/c)^6\\). But that's a bit odd because coefficients are usually numerical, not expressions. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 (c + 1/c)^6\\). So, in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\((c + 1/c)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and it gets multiplied by each term in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\((c + 1/c)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6(c + 1/c)^6\\). But that seems to be the case. So, perhaps the answer is \\(6(c + 1/c)^6\\). But that feels a bit strange because usually, coefficients are constants, but in this case, since we're dealing with multiple variables, it's acceptable. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects a numerical coefficient, but I don't see how that would work because \\(c\\) is a variable. So, maybe the answer is \\(6(c + 1/c)^6\\). Let me check that again. When you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), so the coefficient is indeed 6 times \\((c + 1/c)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6(c + 1/c)^6\\). But wait, that seems too involved. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient when considering all variables, but that's not clear. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only concerned with the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms and doesn't care about \\(c\\), so the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\((c + 1/c)^6\\). So, the coefficient is \\(6(c + 1/c)^6\\). Alternatively, perhaps I should expand \\((c + 1/c)^6\\) and then state that the coefficient is 6 times that expansion. But I think the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, so perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, that would be the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, in that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\). That makes more sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Then, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\) is the middle term when expanded. Let me compute that. Using the binomial theorem, \\((c + 1/c)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the answer is 120. Wait, that makes sense. So, I think that's the correct approach. So, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120. I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the two coefficients found:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), so maybe I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\). Because if I take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by the constant term from the second part, that would give me a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, let me check that.

So, yes, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. So, I think that's the answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

But that's not correct because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that can't be right because then the coefficient would be a sum, not a single value. Hmm, maybe I need to think differently. Let's consider the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not correct because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) varies. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that we're only interested in the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term. Because any other term would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, so \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^k\\) for \\(k \\neq 0\\) would not be just \\(a^2b^2\\), but \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. So, I need to find two things: 1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found to be 6. 2. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply these two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, let me work on finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). I need to find the value of \\(k\\) such that the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\) => \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the two coefficients: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. That seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\).

    "text": " Let me think again. Actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will contribute terms that are separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), we need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it won't change the variables. So, let me first find the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, this would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\cdot c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that term will not affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term when multiplied. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of the \\(c^0\\) term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a term \\(20c^0 = 20\\). Now, since we're multiplying \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and the term in the other expansion that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is 20. So, when we multiply these together, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me double-check that. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only looking for the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, which is independent of \\(c\\), the only contribution comes from multiplying \\(6a^2b^2\\) by the constant term 20 from the second expansion. So, yes, that should be correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. I think that's the answer.\n\nWait, hold on a second. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), gives \\(6a^2b^2\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), gives a constant term 20 when expanded. So, when we multiply these together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is indeed \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). But wait, does the multiplication affect the variables? Let me think: \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiplying it by the constant term from the second part. So, yes, that should be correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility that other terms in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) could combine with terms from \\((a + b)^4\\) to produce \\(a^2b^2\\)? For example, if I have a term in \\((a + b)^4\\) that's \\(a^2b^2\\) and a term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that's \\(c^k\\), then when multiplied, the term would be \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) times \\(a^2b^2\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but actually, no, that's not correct. Wait, no, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be a term that's \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But in the problem statement, it just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying any particular power of \\(c\\). Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Wait, maybe I misinterpreted the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, actually, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, when we multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for each \\(m\\) such that the term in the second polynomial is \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\), but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that is, the coefficient when considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) evaluated at the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present. But wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the product will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents and \\(c\\) exponents. So, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) term. So, in other words, the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by 6. Because each term in the second polynomial is a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, for example, when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, you get terms like \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m} a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) evaluated at all powers of \\(c\\). Wait, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, in that case, the coefficient would be a term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But the problem didn't specify a particular power of \\(c\\), so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient when considering all powers of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense either. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), meaning that it's the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, each multiplied by the corresponding \\(c\\) term. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a single number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then it's a single coefficient. So, in that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, that would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, as I calculated earlier, that's \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let's think about how the multiplication works. Each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which has exponents of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear in the product with coefficients multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. But that would give a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a single number. Therefore, it's more likely that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, the coefficient is indeed 120, as calculated earlier. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nTo recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20.\n\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together to get 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (assuming it's multiplied by \\(c^0\\)) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then multiplying them together.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   - The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\) in the binomial expansion.\n   - Coefficient: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   - The term with \\(c^0\\) corresponds to \\(m = 3\\) in the binomial expansion.\n   - Coefficient: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients**:\n   - \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer**: \\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we're looking for the coefficient when the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) component, which would make the term have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something like that, but we only want \\(a^2b^2\\), so \\(k\\) must be 0. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I have already found that the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient from the second part is 20. Now, to find the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, we multiply the two coefficients together: 6 (from the first part) times 20 (from the second part). That gives 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) just 6, and then multiplied by 20? Or is there something else I'm missing? Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is 6\\(a^2b^2\\), and it's multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But we're only interested in the terms where the product results in \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be when the second term is a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), because any other term would introduce \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), making the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or similar. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. So, I think that's the correct answer. Let me just double-check my calculations to be sure. First, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, correct. Then, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20, correct. Multiplying them gives 120. Yeah, that seems right.

But that doesn't seem correct either because the second part is an expression, not a constant. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of the two expressions. So, if I denote the first expression as \\(E_1 = (a + b)^4\\) and the second as \\(E_2 = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the product is \\(E_1 \\times E_2\\). When I expand this product, each term in \\(E_1\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(E_2\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(E_1\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(E_2\\). But since the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient will be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(E_1\\) and the sum of all coefficients in \\(E_2\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(E_2\\), the \\(c\\) terms will just tag along, but we only care about the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me think differently. When you have a product of two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so any term in \\(E_2\\) that has \\(c\\) raised to any power will not affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because \\(c\\) and \\(a, b\\) are different variables. Wait, that can't be right because \\(c\\) is a separate variable, so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by, say, \\(c^3\\), you get a term \\(a^2b^2c^3\\), which is different from \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term in \\(E_2\\) that has \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, the term in \\(E_2\\) that has \\(c^0\\) is the constant term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(E_1\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(E_2\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me calculate that.

We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(E_1\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(E_2\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\(E_1 \\times E_2\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, does that make sense? Let me check. So, \\(E_1\\) has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), and \\(E_2\\) has a constant term 20. So, when multiplied together, the term \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 120a^2b^2\\). Yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

But since we're only interested in terms that result in \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) part would have to be multiplied by 1, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion, each of those terms will contribute to the coefficient. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. If I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\), then when I expand this, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which are of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by all these terms, each contributing a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) and a power of \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that means we have to sum all the contributions from the second expansion. Wait, no, actually, no. Because if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, then each term in the product will be of the form \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{6 - 2k}\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), irrespective of the power of \\(c\\). So, that means that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient from the first part (\\(6\\)) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), adds to the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, and \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means that when we expand the entire product, every term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any term from the second expansion will contribute to the coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from the second part, which is 64, as calculated before. So, 6 times 64 is 384. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the product of the two expansions, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first part, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is indeed 64. So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms that multiply together to give that specific term. In this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term in the second polynomial will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, each term in the second polynomial, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will add its coefficient to the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it differently. Let me compute \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. It's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so it's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\), as I had before. So, that part is correct. Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64.

But that seems a bit off. Wait, no, because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for a term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, then the term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and when I multiply it by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is another polynomial, each term in that expansion would be multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\).

But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" Hmm, so perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you expand the entire product, the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\) would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating the \\(c\\) terms as separate, so the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term comes from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's not a numerical coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the product. That makes more sense. So, let's approach it that way. So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when I multiply 6 by that coefficient, I'll get the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, let's compute that. The expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, that's 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), which equals 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but I'm not sure if I interpreted the problem correctly. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", not \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, maybe I was supposed to consider all possible powers of \\(c\\), but that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\). Hmm, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, maybe I was supposed to consider that when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by every term in the \\(c\\) expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion. But that sum is equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\), because when you set \\(c = 1\\), the value of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. But wait, that can't be right because when you set \\(c = 1\\), the expression \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), which is the sum of all coefficients. So, if I multiply 6 by 64, I get 384. But earlier, I found that the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20, so 6 times 20 is 120. So, which is it? Hmm, I think I need to clarify the problem. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". In the product of two polynomials, each term is a product of terms from each polynomial. So, \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not a numerical coefficient; it's a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120, as I found earlier. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering only the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't seem likely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and not considering the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part. But that seems unlikely because the expression includes both parts. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would require considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial, which isn't a single number. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.

So, that would mean I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is the same as the constant term in that expansion. Let me calculate that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).

Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).

But that can't be right because the entire expression is a product of two expansions, so the \\(c\\) terms do influence the overall expression, but when considering \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would be the same as in the first part multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second part. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). We need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).

So, when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first expansion times the entire second expansion, because each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second.

The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are from the first part, and the terms involving \\(c\\) are from the second part.

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is indeed 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems correct. Let me confirm by another method. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the sum of coefficients from the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.

    "text": " Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), when I multiply the two expressions, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, that would mean that in the product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) times some term with \\(c^k\\), that term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), it must be multiplied by the constant term in the other expansion. So, that means I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. So, let me focus on finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem for this. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), I get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) times 20 (the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, so is that the final answer? Let me double-check. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. When you multiply these two expansions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we only care about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we're only interested in the term where the second expansion contributes a \\(c^0\\) term, which is 20. So, the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two polynomials, and when you multiply them, the coefficients multiply for the respective terms. So, yeah, I think 120 is the correct coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). I don't think I made any mistakes here. Let me just recap: The coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying them gives 120.

If there were any \\(c\\) terms, they would change the exponent of \\(c\\), but since we don't have \\(c\\) in the term we're interested in, maybe only the constant term from the second expansion will contribute.

But that doesn't make sense because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) includes terms with different powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, that means that in the entire product, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is if the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part contributes a term that is a constant, i.e., \\(c^0\\). Because if we have \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0\\), that would give us \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and to get the \\(c^0\\) term from the other part, which is 20. So, when you multiply these two parts, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but only the term with \\(c^0\\) will result in a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms will have additional \\(c\\) exponents, which we don't want. Therefore, the total coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.

    "text": " Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term would come from taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiplying it by any term from the second part. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit confusing. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\) which gives me terms like \\(a^4, a^3b, a^2b^2, ab^3, b^4\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) which gives me terms involving different powers of \\(c\\), then when I multiply them together, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term from the second polynomial. But since the second polynomial doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because then the coefficient would be a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanded, each term will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because each term in the second part has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes part of the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something like that. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't what the problem is asking. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, in the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be a sum over all the terms from the second expansion, each multiplied by the coefficient from the first expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, that can't be right because the coefficient would then be a function of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, I think. Maybe I'm missing something here. Let me try to clarify. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanded, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or something like that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by \\(c^m\\) where \\(m\\) can vary. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\), specifically, the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power, i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would involve \\(c\\). So, let me assume that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. So, to find that, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That sounds more reasonable. So, let's proceed with that approach.\n\nFirst, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNext, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand this using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\).\n\nThe coefficient corresponding to \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is the product of the two coefficients we found: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Is that correct? So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives \\(c^0\\) with coefficient 20. So, when you multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, resulting in \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem was just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But since the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

But since I only care about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), any term from the second expansion that's not \\(c^0\\) will result in a term that has \\(c\\) raised to some power, which won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, only the \\(c^0\\) term contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, multiplying 6 by 20 gives me the correct coefficient, which is 120. Yeah, that makes sense.

    "text": " The entire expression is a product of two expansions, so maybe I need to consider the coefficients from both parts. But actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the \\(c\\) terms don't affect it.

So, when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) by every possible term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you're effectively scaling \\(a^2b^2\\) by each coefficient from the second expansion. But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product equal to the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part. So, let me check that. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) because the problem just says \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) could have different powers of \\(c\\). But the problem doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so maybe it's considering all possible powers, which would mean that the coefficient is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Let me try another way. Maybe I should consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by any term from the second part, it would still be \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 64, as I thought earlier. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem, and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. In that case, I would need to find the term where, in the second expansion, the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Let me check that. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I'm confused now. Which approach is correct? Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It just says \\(a^2b^2\\), without mentioning \\(c\\). So, does that mean it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), or is it assuming that \\(c\\) cancels out, making the exponent 0? Hmm, maybe the problem is expecting that since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term independent of \\(c\\), we need to find the coefficient when the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, that would make the coefficient 120. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about how the product works. When you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which includes different powers of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will actually be \\(a^2b^2\\) times a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a single number. Wait, that can't be right. I think I'm mixing up coefficients and terms. Let me clarify. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all the products of coefficients from the first expansion and the second expansion where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2. Since the second expansion only affects the exponents of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes its coefficient to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64, as I calculated earlier. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, earlier I thought that maybe the problem wants the coefficient where \\(c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. So, which one is it? The problem is a bit ambiguous. Let me look for similar problems or think about how such questions are usually phrased. Typically, when asked for the coefficient of a term that doesn't involve another variable, it's considered independent of that variable, which would mean the exponents of those variables are zero. So, in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) would imply that \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power. Therefore, the correct approach would be to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think the answer is 120. Let me confirm that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them together gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   To find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\Rightarrow k = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both expansions:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."
