    "text": " Let me think again. Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is a product of two binomials raised to powers. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the terms will combine. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with those involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that can't be right because that would mean the coefficient is 6 times something. But maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply as well. But in this case, since we're looking for a specific term \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient, so perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Wait, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is a product, so when you expand it, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in \\((a + b)^4\\), the other part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), can be treated as a constant multiplier. Wait, that makes more sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because that would make the coefficient a sum involving \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That would make sense because then the term would be \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is just 1, so the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, let me check that. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) has coefficient 6, and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) would be the constant term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That makes sense. So, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives 20 for \\(c^0\\), so multiplying them gives 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems right.

Wait, no, that's not right either. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, if I'm looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), that term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\). Then, when I multiply it by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), it becomes \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, that's not correct because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has different powers of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they become terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) remains as a standalone term is if we consider the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, meaning \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, that would mean we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by 6. So, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, to recap, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives a term \\(20c^0\\). When multiplied together, they give \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2c^0 = 120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 120. Alternatively, if I think about the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would be the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. But wait, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 would be 384. But that's not correct because that would be the coefficient if we were considering \\(a^2b^2\\) times any term, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only include the terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, right? Because if there are other exponents, the term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is different from \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think my initial approach was correct, that the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. Let me double-check by considering the entire expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) as 6a^2b^2. Then, when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has 20 as the coefficient for \\(c^0\\), so when multiplied, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120, and the term would be \\(120a^2b^2\\). So, that makes sense.

Wait, no, that doesn't sound right.

So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Hmm, I'm not sure. Let me think differently. Maybe I should consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the terms that multiply to give that term. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, so it's 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term would contribute to a different term in the product, but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) alone would just be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second part. Wait, but the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me find the sum of its coefficients. The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check if I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when I multiply this by \\((a + b)^4\\), which has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), the product would have terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term would be \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that would mean that for each \\(m\\), we have a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But wait, that's the same as 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m\\) from 0 to 6. The sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m=0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\), as I thought earlier. So, 6 times 64 is indeed 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because sometimes when you have multiple variables, you have to consider if the terms can combine in a way that affects the coefficient. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the second part contributes a coefficient that multiplies it, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think this approach is correct.

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.

So, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense because when you multiply the two expansions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will only combine with the constant term from the second part to give a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant. So, first, I already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me apply the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient should be 120. Let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 120. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I made any calculation errors. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

But that's not correct because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a separate term, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\).

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\), so that the term is just \\(a^2b^2\\). In that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. That makes more sense. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be done using the binomial theorem as well.

In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. When I multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion.

So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would require \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as before. Then, for the \\(c\\) part, we need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\).

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not quite accurate because each term in the second part has different powers of \\(c\\), but when you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because then it would be a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\). Wait, no, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me clarify: The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand both parts, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\). So, that means we're looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponents of \\(c\\) sum to zero because \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, in other words, we need to find all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that have \\(c^0\\), and then multiply those coefficients by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). So, let me break it down:\n\n1. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\).\n2. Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression.\n\nOkay, that makes sense. So, step 1: Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). As I calculated earlier, that's \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nStep 2: Coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand this using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nSo, now, step 3: Multiply the two coefficients together. That is, \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(k = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 times 20 is 120. That seems correct. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by considering both parts of the expression. \n\n1. From \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. From \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{120}"

But that seems a bit confusing. Wait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, that might be the case. Let me see. So, if I have two expressions multiplied together, say \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). Because when you multiply, each term in \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\), so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by every term in \\(Q\\), effectively scaling its coefficient by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). Let me check that: if \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by \\((a + b)^4\\), and since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear is through the term in \\((a + b)^4\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, giving 384. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of the two expansions. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives terms with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient, it's 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that is a constant term (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero), because when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by that constant term, it will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the overall expansion.

For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is at \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120.

Wait, no, that can't be right.

Wait, but that seems a bit off. Let me clarify: When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way that can happen is if we take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if we take any other term from the second expansion, it would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) term, which would mean the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something, but we only want \\(a^2b^2\\), so the \\(c\\) terms must cancel out, meaning we have to multiply by the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel each other. Wait, no, actually, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, will have terms involving \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\), each with their own coefficients.

But since we're only interested in terms where the result is \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) part, but actually, no, because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the same as considering the product without the \\(c\\) terms, but that's not correct because the \\(c\\) terms are part of the expression. Wait, no, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product.

So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product would come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part by the \\(c^0\\) term from the second part, because that's the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. Therefore, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me compute that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.

That sounds reasonable. So, let me work on that. First, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Now, since we're multiplying \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term (with respect to \\(c\\)) from the second part, which is 20. Therefore, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, does that make sense? Let me double-check. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) for \\(c^0\\) is 20. Since these two terms are multiplied together, the overall coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials, and when looking for a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only consider the constant term in the \\(c\\) part. So, yeah, that seems right. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Wait, actually, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the terms that result in \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), maybe the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, the \\(c\\) terms can be anything because they don't interfere with the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. Wait, but that doesn't sound quite right. Let me think again. The problem is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the \\(c\\) terms can be anything because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts. So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, that seems too broad because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has multiple terms, each with different powers of \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, we're looking for all terms in the expansion where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, and for each such term, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, since in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\). So, when we multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't sound right either because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by each term in \\((a + b)^4\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that can't be because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not a polynomial in \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when you expand it, each term will be of the form \\((a^kb^{4 - k}) \\times (c^m \\times \\text{something})\\). But since we're only interested in terms where \\(a^2b^2\\), that is, \\(k = 2\\) and \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Now, the other part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms with different powers of \\(c\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\). So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me check if that makes sense. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). We need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the expansion, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when we multiply this by \\((a + b)^4\\), which has terms \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\), the entire product will have terms \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we are looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which corresponds to \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and the corresponding coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\), when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the term becomes \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Wait, that can't be right because that would be 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m\\) from 0 to 6, which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large. Wait, no, because for each \\(m\\), the term is \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), so the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(m = 6\\), which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems correct because each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient accumulates all those contributions. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, but the problem didn't specify that. It just said the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384. But let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) because that's the term where \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, now I'm confused. So, which is it? Let me clarify the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That means we have to consider all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, each multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. But that's the same as 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 * 20 = 120. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's 384. Wait, but that seems too large. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply together to give that specific term. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product comes from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) with any term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would be different, but as it stands, it's asking for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so 384 is the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

Let me clarify: when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the product will have terms that are combinations of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), we need to find all the terms in the product that have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) (including \\(c^0\\), which is 1). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me think: No, actually, when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply. So, if I have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and I multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then each term in the product will be \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\text{(terms from the second expansion)}\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think we need to consider that any term in the second expansion multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is some integer. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean we're looking for all terms in the product where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that might be the case. Let me check: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is of the form \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get terms \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, effectively, we're treating \\(c\\) as a variable independent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and we want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) part. So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but how do we find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if we set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me think again: When you have two polynomials multiplied together, say P(a, b) * Q(c), the coefficient of a term in P that doesn't involve c will be multiplied by the entire Q(c). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's the coefficient from P(a, b) times the sum of all coefficients in Q(c). Because each term in Q(c) will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, giving terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) part, we sum all the coefficients from Q(c). So, yes, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, I could think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the middle term, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Wait, that contradicts what I thought earlier. So, now I'm confused. Let me clarify: If I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively, then I need to find the product of the coefficients from each part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the middle term, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. But wait, the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that I need to consider all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) term. Therefore, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But now I'm getting two different answers depending on how I interpret the problem. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That means that any term in the product that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) (including positive and negative exponents) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As calculated earlier, that's 6 * 64 = 384. However, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 * 20 = 120. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on \\(c\\), I think the correct approach is to multiply 6 by the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, which is 64, giving 384. Let me confirm this by considering the expansion. The product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be written as the sum over all terms from the first expansion multiplied by the sum over all terms from the second expansion. So, each term in the product is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponent of \\(c\\), we get \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we're interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, for \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for each such term, we multiply by \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) and \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum over all possible \\(m\\) from 0 to 6. So, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(m = 6\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that confirms my earlier conclusion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we multiply the coefficient from the first expansion (6) by the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion (64):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and the rest of the expression is multiplied by it. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the same as the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's a product of two expressions, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables are separate. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, and the other part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), would be multiplied as a whole. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient, not an expression in \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm supposed to treat the entire expression as a product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would still involve \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., 1. So, that would involve taking the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, that would mean I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Let me confirm that. Yes, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term we're interested in. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\) => \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. The coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying them together gives 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Yeah, that makes sense.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem, which is 6. Then, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"

So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then I need to consider all possible terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But wait, actually, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from \\((a + b)^4\\), when I multiply it by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe the coefficient is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't seem right because the \\(c\\) terms are variables too. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so it's possible that the \\(c\\) terms can be any value, but since we're looking for the coefficient, maybe we just need to consider the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right either because each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has different powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term would contribute a different power of \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe the coefficient is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That would make sense because then we're looking for the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, in that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That sounds more plausible. So, let me break it down into two parts: first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already did as 6. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply those two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, let's work on the second part: finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, putting it all together: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. Wait, but hold on a second. The original problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe I misinterpreted it. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would involve all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that seems complicated because then the coefficient would be a sum over all terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But the problem didn't specify any restriction on \\(c\\), so maybe I need to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, if I take 6 * 64, that would be 384. But that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6, but that seems too simple. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that when you multiply the two expressions, each term in the product will have terms from both expansions, but since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, the \\(c\\) terms can be anything, so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But earlier, I thought that the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. Now I'm confused. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial. But that seems odd because usually, when asked for a coefficient, it's in terms of specific variables. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to treat \\(c\\) as another variable and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem doesn't specify, so maybe I should consider that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which would be 6*(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6). But that seems complicated, and I don't think that's what the problem is asking for. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6*20=120. That seems more reasonable. So, perhaps the problem is intended to have the exponent of \\(c\\) be zero, so that the term is \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6*20=120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply expecting the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) for the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, which is 20, so 6*20=120. That seems plausible.
