    "text": " Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand this, each term will be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term must come from the part where we take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and multiply it by any term from the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a numerical value, not a polynomial. Oh, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all terms, including those multiplied by \\(c\\) terms. But that seems odd because \\(a^2b^2\\) is separate from \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but I think the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficients add up. Wait, but that might not be correct because the second expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you'd get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would just be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, actually, the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's just 6 times the sum of all coefficients of the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest is part of the \\(c\\) terms. But the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the entire product, so I think it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiply it by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second polynomial. Because if you take any other term from the second polynomial, it would have a \\(c^k\\) term, which would make the product term have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, I think I was wrong earlier. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's compute that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, that makes more sense. So, I think I made a mistake earlier by considering the sum of all coefficients, but actually, only the constant term (with respect to \\(c\\)) contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the correct coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Let me confirm that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives \\(c^0\\) term with coefficient 20. So, when multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.

Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the exponents add. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not any other terms involving \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient remains the same as in the first part, because each term in the second part is just a scalar multiple when considering the multiplication with \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right either because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a separate term, so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not possible because \\(a^2b^2\\) would have to be multiplied by \\(c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself isn't present unless \\(k=0\\), but \\(c^0 = 1\\). Wait, but in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), is there a term with \\(c^0\\)? Let me check. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We need to find when this exponent is 0, because that's the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) would stand alone without any \\(c\\) terms. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by 20, giving \\(20a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 20 times the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which was 6. So, 20 * 6 = 120. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when you multiply these two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that when you multiply the two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, we only consider the product of the corresponding coefficients. So, 6 from the first part and 20 from the second part, giving 120.

Simplifying that, it becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).

So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).

Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients from each polynomial for the corresponding terms that multiply to give that term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second part, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be the same as the coefficient in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, because the second part doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms.

Now, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables.

We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the other term is 20. When we multiply these together, it's 6*20=120. That seems correct. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand it, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by all the terms from the second part, but only the term with \\(c^0\\) will contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, yes, 6*20=120 is correct. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by multiplying the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem**:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\).

But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) part. Hmm, wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Wait, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which isn't possible because coefficients are numbers, not expressions. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a product, and we're to find the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, we need to find all the terms in the product where the exponent of \\(a\\) is 2 and the exponent of \\(b\\) is 2, and sum up their coefficients, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). That makes sense. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not quite right either. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that correct? Because when you multiply by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you're effectively scaling the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by each coefficient in that expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we have to consider that each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) by its own coefficient. So, the total coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), setting \\(c = 1\\) gives us \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible terms, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the product of two independent expansions: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and one in \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and since in the other expansion, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), every term is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64. So, 6 times 64 is 384. That seems to make sense. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient being the product of the coefficients from each part. Since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term has a coefficient, and when you multiply, each of those coefficients gets multiplied by 6, and all those contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, yes, 6 times 64 is 384. So, I think the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Another way to think about it is to consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Therefore, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.

Wait, but that's not correct either because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a numerical value, not an expression in \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Hmm, that might make sense. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. That is, the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) cancels out. So, in that case, I would first find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you just get \\(a^2b^2\\), and that's the term we're interested in. So, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on that. Let's expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Now, we're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)). So, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them together gives 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, if the problem was just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the answer would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem to be what the problem is asking.

So, when you expand this product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by any term from the second part. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit odd because usually, when you're looking for a specific term, you don't consider all the other terms. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, maybe the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) and its reciprocal, but since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we can treat the second part as a constant. Wait, that might be the case. Let me think: If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then when I look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because every term in the second expansion will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because each term in the product would have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, it's the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, each multiplied by the corresponding \\(c\\) term. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second expansion). And since the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, as I found earlier, then 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me think again. Is that correct? Because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in the first part, and when you multiply it by each term in the second part, each of those terms will have some power of \\(c\\), but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, you're effectively summing over all possible \\(c\\) terms multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then it would be different, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, we consider the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

But actually, no, that's not quite right. Wait, no, because when you multiply two expressions together, any term in the first expression is multiplied by any term in the second. But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression is a single term, so when you multiply it by the entire second expression, you'd get \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, that would mean that the coefficient is \\(6\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense for a coefficient. So, I think that's the case. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. So, let me adjust my approach. So, first, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) as I did before, and I know the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when I multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will multiply the \\(c^0\\) term from the second part, giving me \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term we're interested in. So, now, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Now, since the two parts are multiplied together, the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when I multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the term where \\(c^0\\) is present, that term will be \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0\\), and its coefficient will be 6 times 20, which is 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't skip anything or make a calculation error. First, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) gives the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. Then, expanding \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives the term \\(c^0\\) with coefficient 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire product being the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) and \\(c^0\\) in each respective expansion. So, yes, that would be 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's right. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by considering the expansion of each part separately and then multiplying the relevant coefficients.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**  \n   Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**  \n   The term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(m = 3\\), giving the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**  \n   \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe all the terms from the second expansion will just be multiplied by 1 for the \\(a^2b^2\\) term? Wait, no, that can't be right because the second expansion does involve \\(c\\), but \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) in it, so perhaps when we multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems off because that would make the coefficient a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), which is not possible.

Wait, but that doesn't make much sense because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term from the second expansion, resulting in multiple terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but that would mean that the coefficient itself is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem just says \"the coefficient\", so maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, but only considering the terms where \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., where the exponents of \\(c\\) in the term are zero. Wait, that might make sense. So, maybe the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a term from the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\), which is just 1. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. Let me check that. So, if I consider the entire product, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, if I'm looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), that means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, that part is 6, as I found earlier. Now, for the \\(c\\) part, the exponent on \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). If I want the term where \\(c^0\\), then \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). But wait, the problem just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Hmm, so maybe I'm overcomplicating it again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient is the sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the question is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve considering all possible terms from the second expansion, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the question is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. But the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, that seems too high. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the product, and since the second part is a separate expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, that doesn't seem right either because when you multiply polynomials, each term from the first polynomial multiplies each term from the second. So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part would be multiplied by every term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), meaning that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I must be misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". Perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when the entire expression is expanded, treating all variables as separate.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is the product of the coefficients from each part, but that would require multiplying the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) by the entire expansion of the second part, which is not a number but a polynomial. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that the second part is a separate expansion, but perhaps only the constant term (in \\(c\\)) is being considered. That is, the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, resulting in \\(c^0\\), so that the term is just a number. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, as I calculated earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, I think that's the answer. Let me double-check that. So, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives a term \\(c^0\\) with coefficient 20. Therefore, when multiplied together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, so the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). That makes sense. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.

Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the second part is a separate expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, because \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has terms with positive and negative exponents of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. That would make more sense. So, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, it just says \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering the entire expression, and the \\(c\\) terms are part of the expression, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that seems odd because the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a number, so perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering that the entire expression is a product, so each term in the product is a combination of terms from both expansions. So, to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\), you have to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that's a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient would then be a polynomial, not a number. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and ignore the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part because it doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, let me try that approach. So, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the term where \\(c\\) cancels out is when \\(k = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 120. So, the coefficient is 120. That seems more reasonable. So, I think that's the correct approach. So, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we also need the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out in the second part. Using the binomial theorem on \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(k = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients together: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, when you multiply these two expressions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and doesn't involve \\(c\\), then any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will just be a scalar multiplier for the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which can't be right because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not a polynomial in \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when you expand the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, the expanded form will have terms involving \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) across all \\(k\\). Wait, that makes more sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for all \\(k\\). But that seems a bit involved. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean treating the entire \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as a single term. But that doesn't seem right either because the problem includes both \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when expanded, it would have multiple terms. Wait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would give a polynomial in \\(c\\), and the question is probably expecting a numerical coefficient. Hmm, I'm a bit confused now. Let me try to approach it differently.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), then perhaps the coefficient is simply 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would give a coefficient that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not quite right either because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which would give \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, if I take 6 times 64, that would be 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as a numerical value, considering all possible terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, as I thought before, so 384. But I'm not entirely confident about this approach. Let me check another way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as the product of the coefficients from each part, but that doesn't make sense because the two parts are being multiplied together. Wait, no, that's not correct because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is being multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the expansion, which again is a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and not considering the other part. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. Hmm, I'm getting confused here. Maybe I should approach it differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but the problem doesn't specify \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I calculated before, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure if this is the correct interpretation. Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as just 6, because the other part doesn't affect it. But that seems too simplistic, especially since the problem includes both parts. Let me try to think again.\n\nWait, another approach: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, in this case, \\((a + b)^4\\) has a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has terms like \\(c^6, 6c^4, 15c^2, 20, 15c^{-2}, 6c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\). So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the sum of the coefficients of each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second polynomial will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing to the overall coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I calculated earlier, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. I think that makes sense now.\n\nWait, but let me verify that. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), which is the sum of all coefficients. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by 64, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) becomes 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the problem as just finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), ignoring the other part, it would be 6, but that seems like I'm neglecting the other factor, which doesn't make sense because the entire expression is the product of both. So, I think the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which gives 384.\n\nWait, but another thought: perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient would be 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product. So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the other part is just a distraction. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, let me try a different approach. Let's expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) separately and then see how the product works.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nNext, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, the terms are:\n\n- \\(k=0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1 \\cdot c^6\\)\n- \\(k=1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^4 = 6c^4\\)\n- \\(k=2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^2 = 15c^2\\)\n- \\(k=3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\\)\n- \\(k=4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(k=5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(k=6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the sum of the coefficients from each term in the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, that would be:\n\n6 * (1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, that's the same result as before. So, that seems to confirm that the coefficient is 384.\n\nBut let me check: the sum inside the parentheses is 1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1. Let's calculate that:\n\n1 + 6 = 7\n\n7 + 15 = 22\n\n22 + 20 = 42\n\n42 + 15 = 57\n\n57 + 6 = 63\n\n63 + 1 = 64.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the sum is 64, and 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think if there's another way this could be interpreted. For example, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, so \\(c^0\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I don't think that's the case. The problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean summing over all possible \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, I think 384 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but to confirm, let me consider that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. In this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. Yes, that makes sense.\n\nI think I've convinced myself that the correct coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the only way that can happen is if we take the term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because any other term would involve \\(c\\) raised to some power, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would result in a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me check that logic again. So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But we're only interested in the terms where the result has \\(a^2b^2\\). That means we have to pick \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and then from the second part, we have to pick the term that has \\(c^0\\), because if we pick any other term with \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), then the resulting term will have \\(c\\) in it, which we don't want. So, yes, I think that's correct. So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me apply the binomial theorem again to this part. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents: \\(c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the constant term. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, since the original expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients we found from each part. So, that would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). Let me calculate that: 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake, let me go through the steps again. First, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed at \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient is 6. Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is 20. Multiplying them together gives 120. That seems correct.

Wait, no, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, so when you expand both parts and multiply them, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that right? Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients from each polynomial for the terms that multiply to give that term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), every term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will multiply with \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but is that correct? Let me think again. Suppose I have two expressions, \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\). Then, the product \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\) would have terms where each term in \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the entire \\(Q(c)\\), because every term in \\(Q(c)\\) will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all variables, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would involve \\(c\\) terms, which isn't a single number. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. That would make the problem well-defined. So, the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. So, I need to find the coefficient where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, let's break it down.\n\nFirst, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already found to be 6. Now, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when we multiply the two parts together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion, and we're only interested in the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, i.e., the constant term. So, let's compute that.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nNow, since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6 and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives 20 for \\(c^0\\). So, when we multiply these together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, but we only want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which is 20. So, the total coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to consider the entire product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), we just take the coefficients from each part and multiply them together.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me figure that out. The expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well.

Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. Since we're multiplying these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we're only concerned with the term in the second part that doesn't have any \\(c\\) dependence, which is the constant term. So, yes, the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that makes sense. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Next, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives the final coefficient as \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would mean that the \\(c\\) terms must cancel out in such a way that the product term has no \\(c\\).

So, that term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) must be a constant term, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.

Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in the second part). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that.
