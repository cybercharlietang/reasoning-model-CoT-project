    "text": " If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) giving me 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) giving me 20 for \\(c^0\\), then when I multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by \\(c^0\\), so the coefficient would indeed be 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two polynomials, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) and \\(c^0\\), so their coefficients multiply. That makes sense. So, I think the coefficient is 120. I don't see any mistakes in that reasoning. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me go through it again. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) has a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a term \\(c^0\\) with coefficient 20. So, when I multiply these two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will multiply the \\(c^0\\) term from the second part, giving me \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). The coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, if I were to expand the entire expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from all possible products where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) add up to 2 in each part, but since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's only contributing a scalar multiple. So, that's why it's just 6 * 20. I think that's solid. So, I'm confident the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both expansions:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."
