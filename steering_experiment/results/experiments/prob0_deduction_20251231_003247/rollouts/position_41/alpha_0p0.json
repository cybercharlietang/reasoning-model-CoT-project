Multiply these two coefficients together to get 120. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations. The binomial coefficients were calculated correctly, and the logic about only needing the constant term from the \\(c\\) part makes sense because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, which we don't want since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I'm confident the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). \n\nNext, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by solving \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), giving \\(m = 3\\). The binomial coefficient here is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nMultiplying these coefficients together: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120. I think that makes sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second.
