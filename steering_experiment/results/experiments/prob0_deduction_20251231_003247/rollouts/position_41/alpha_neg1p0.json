    "text": " Yes, because when you multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will multiply the constant term from the second part, and since they're separate variables, their coefficients multiply. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, the problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). We're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which is only affected by the first part, but since the second part is multiplied by it, we have to consider the constant term in the second part because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would make the product have \\(c\\) terms, but we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). Wait, actually, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), it must be that the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by the constant term in the second polynomial. Otherwise, the product would have \\(c\\) terms attached, which would make the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), which isn't what we're looking for. So, yes, only the constant term in the second polynomial contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that means the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. Hmm, that seems correct.
