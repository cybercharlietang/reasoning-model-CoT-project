    "text": " I don't think I missed anything here. Let me just visualize the expansion again. When you expand \\((a + b)^4\\), you get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is indeed 6. Then, when you expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, which happens when you take 3 terms of \\(c\\) and 3 terms of \\(1/c\\), which gives \\(c^0\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when you multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by the constant term from the second part, giving \\(6 * 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the logic or the calculations. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) corresponds to \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from each expansion:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.
