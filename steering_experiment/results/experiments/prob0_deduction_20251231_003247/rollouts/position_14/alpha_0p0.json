    "text": " I'm not sure if I need to expand this part as well, but maybe not because the problem is only asking about \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, actually, the entire expression is a product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the part involving \\(c\\) doesn't affect this term. Let me think about that. When you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), it would come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term (if any) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, because if I take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and multiply it by something from the second part, I need to make sure that the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out so that the term doesn't involve \\(c\\) anymore. Alternatively, maybe the second part contributes a coefficient that is multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. Let me clarify. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanded, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{2}b^{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^m}\\). Wait, but that's a bit confusing. Let me try to break it down. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is independent of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by the entire second part, it would result in terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the product would involve each term being multiplied by each term, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me think. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term from the second polynomial that's multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) will contribute to a term in the product that has \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, that's not the case. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which includes all possible powers of \\(c\\). Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me calculate that. Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem: \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which means \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. So, the key idea is that when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term (like \\(a^2b^2\\)) is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the term in the second expression that doesn't involve \\(c\\) (i.e., the constant term) is what contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, yes, that would be 6 times 20, which is 120. Alternatively, if I think about the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and then it's multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but only the term with \\(c^0\\) contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, indeed, it's 6 times 20, which is 120. Let me see if there's another way to approach this. Maybe by considering the entire product and looking for the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and \\(c^0\\) from the second part. That term's coefficient would be 6 times 20, as we found. Alternatively, if I were to expand both parts separately and then multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, but wait, no, that's not quite right. Wait, actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum over all terms in the second polynomial of the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first and each term in the second. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is a constant with respect to the second polynomial, so it's just 6 times each term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Wait, but that can't be right because the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has terms with different powers of \\(c\\). The sum of all coefficients would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), the entire second expression becomes 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that contradicts my earlier answer of 120. Hmm, so now I'm confused. Which approach is correct? Let me think carefully. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, if I consider the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term from the second expansion, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be part of multiple terms in the expanded form, each with different powers of \\(c\\). However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think refers to the term that has exactly \\(a^2b^2\\) and no other variables, i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out to zero. Therefore, I think my initial approach was correct, that the coefficient is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120. But then why did the other approach give a different answer? Because in that approach, I considered the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, leading to 6 times 64, which is 384. But that would be the case if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), but I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, actually, in the product, each term is a combination of powers of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be combined with any power of \\(c\\) from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion. Because for each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get a term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is the exponent from the second expansion. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think refers to the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120. But if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), that would be different. Alternatively, if it had asked for the sum of coefficients of all terms \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But the problem as stated is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think refers to the term where \\(c\\) is not present, i.e., \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the correct answer should be 120. To confirm, let me think of it another way. Suppose I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Then, the product becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that's the coefficient if we consider all possible powers of \\(c\\). However, the original problem didn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so it's ambiguous. Wait, but in the problem statement, it's written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), it's only present when multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient should be 6 times 20, which is 120. So, I think my initial approach was correct, and the confusion arose from interpreting the problem differently. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Expanding using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term (\\(c^0\\)) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\).

But wait, that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), so maybe the answer is just 6. But that seems too simple. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) because it's in the product of both expressions. So, perhaps I need to consider the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\) from the second expansion. That makes more sense. So, let's try that approach. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). We need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\). So, let's break this down. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already found to be 6. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply those two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product. That sounds right. So, let's compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\) so \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\)). So, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but I should make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me double-check. First, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 is when \\(k = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. Yeah, that seems correct.

Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, but that seems a bit off because the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) depend on the powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term would have a coefficient that is the product of the binomial coefficients from each expansion. But actually, no, because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me clarify: in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or something like that, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that means, in the entire product, all the terms where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that means the coefficient is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that can't be right because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), so let me check that. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but that seems high. Let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try a different approach.

So, actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be \\(6\\) times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, that seems correct, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is only affected by the terms in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since the \\(c\\) terms don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the sum of all its coefficients, which is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. That seems to make sense. Alternatively, maybe I should think about it as the product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Yeah, I think that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).

    "text": " I'm not sure if I need to expand this part as well. Wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I have a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) that's \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and then I multiply it by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, perhaps \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the product, and the rest involves \\(c\\). But in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) varies. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that doesn't sound right. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6, because the other part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that seems too simple. Alternatively, maybe the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible terms, but since \\(c\\) is separate, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) be 6 * 64 = 384? Hmm, that seems plausible. Let me check that again. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the product \\((a + b)^4 * 64\\) would have the term \\(6a^2b^2 * 64\\), which is \\(384a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be 384. But wait, is that correct? Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives 64, then yes, 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try another approach. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I calculated earlier, the sum is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Yeah, that makes sense.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) and identifying the term with \\(a^2b^2\\), which has a coefficient of 6. The entire expression is then multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in this part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

So, does that mean I can treat \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)? Or do I need to consider it in some way? Let me think. The entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand the whole thing, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we need to consider how many times \\(a^2b^2\\) appears in the product. Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other factor is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply them, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, that means we need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it won't change the exponent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, I already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, we multiply the two coefficients we found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. Wait, let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(c^{6 - 2m} = c^0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when we multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by 20, resulting in 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I missed anything here.

    "text": " I'm not sure if that affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but I think it might because when you multiply the two expressions together, every term in the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean I don't have to consider the terms from the second expansion that involve \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\)? Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), right? So, when you multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which are terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe we don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they are separate variables. So, perhaps the coefficient remains 6. Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I need to consider that the entire expression is a product, so each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, which comes only from the first part, the coefficient would just be 6 multiplied by whatever the sum of the coefficients in the second part is. Wait, no, because each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is just one term, and when multiplied by the entire second expansion, it would create multiple terms, but only the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be affected by the constant term in the second expansion, because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a constant, you just get the same term. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me check that. So, first, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The general term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is given by \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when we multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term (which has coefficient 6) by the constant term 20 in the second expansion, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, that makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by 20, you get 20a^2b^2, so the coefficient is 20. But wait, no, because the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is 6a^2b^2, and the constant term is 20, so when you multiply them, you get 6 * 20 a^2b^2, which is 120a^2b^2. So, the coefficient is 120. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when you multiply these two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we only consider the terms in the second expansion that don't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), i.e., the constant term. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. I think that's correct. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that since the two parts are multiplied together, the coefficients multiply when the exponents of the variables are the same. So, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only need the constant term from the second expansion, which is 20, and multiply it by the coefficient from the first expansion, which is 6, giving 120. Yeah, that makes sense. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the coefficient should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by considering the binomial expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), where the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6.

Wait, maybe the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would involve \\(c\\), which isn't possible. So, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), so it's effectively the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would be the case if we were to collect like terms. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that we're treating \\(c\\) as another variable, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion, but the coefficient would then be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion, which doesn't make sense because coefficients are scalars. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), etc. Each of these terms is then multiplied by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\).

But in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the \\(c\\) expansion. That would make sense because then the coefficient would just be a number. So, let me check that. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me find that. Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by this constant term. From earlier, we found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when you multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, giving a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. So, the final answer should be 120. Yeah, that makes sense. I think I got it.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20.

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me clarify. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial, so the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. However, in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't combine with the terms involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, you're adding terms, not multiplying the sums. Let me think again. Suppose I have two expressions, P(a, b) and Q(c). Then P(a, b) * Q(c) would have terms where each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) is 6, as I found earlier. But since Q(c) is multiplied by each term in P, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in Q(c). Wait, that makes sense because each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in Q(c). But what is the sum of the coefficients in Q(c), which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set c = 1, then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in Q(c) is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the variables in P and Q are separate, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from P times the entire expansion of Q, but when considering coefficients, perhaps it's just the product of the coefficients, regardless of Q's terms. Wait, no, because when you multiply P(a, b) by Q(c), the variables are independent, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from P times the sum of the coefficients in Q. Because each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * (sum of coefficients in Q). So, sum of coefficients in Q is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me think differently. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the other variables. So, when you expand the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product, but the product includes terms with \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, that makes sense because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is being multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting c = 1, which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Wait, but let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the variables are independent, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the product of the two expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by 6, so the coefficient would be 6 times each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems like it's complicating things, whereas the key point is that since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Let me verify that by considering a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1 = c + 1/c\\). So, the product would be \\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product would be zero because \\(a^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but there's no \\(b^2\\) in those terms. Wait, but in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because you can't get \\(b^2\\) from the second factor. Wait, but in the original problem, the second factor is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which doesn't have any \\(b\\) terms, so when you multiply, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the first factor. Wait a second, that's a different perspective. Since the second factor doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, the only contribution to \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first factor. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, that can't be, because the product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's not how coefficients work. Wait, no, that's not correct. When you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial, but the variables are independent. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I'm effectively summing over all possible products where the first polynomial contributes \\(a^2b^2\\) and the second polynomial contributes any term. But since the second polynomial doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it can contribute any term, but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * (sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)). As before, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Alternatively, let me think of it as the product of two independent polynomials. The first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables don't interact. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is simply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, I think the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought of a simpler example where \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\). In that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no \\(b^2\\) in the second factor. But in our problem, the second factor doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is just the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first factor times each term in the second factor. But since the second factor is being multiplied as a whole, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second factor. Wait, but that's not possible because coefficients are scalars, not polynomials. So, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me correct this.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises because I'm mixing up the concepts of coefficients and terms. Let me clarify: when you have two polynomials P(a, b) and Q(c), their product is a polynomial in variables a, b, and c. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be present only if there's a term \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) times a term in Q(c). Since Q(c) doesn't involve a or b, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in Q(c). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) times the sum of all coefficients in Q(c). Because each term in Q(c) is a coefficient times a power of c, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient times c^k, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of c, we have to sum all the coefficients from Q(c) because each one contributes to a term with \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in the simpler example I thought of earlier, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no \\(b^2\\) in the second factor. Wait, but in that example, the second factor is \\((c + 1/c)\\), which doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would only come from \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first factor times 1 (the constant term in the second factor). But in reality, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present in \\((a + b)^2\\). Wait, so maybe my earlier conclusion is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach it differently. Let's consider the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). We can think of this as the product of two independent polynomials. The first polynomial is in variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in variable \\(c\\). Therefore, when you expand the product, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is \\(6a^2b^2\\). When multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term will be of the form \\(k c^m\\), where \\(k\\) is the coefficient and \\(m\\) is the exponent. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(\\text{sum of all terms in } \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\right)\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum all the coefficients from the second polynomial. The sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting the variable with 1. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, the answer should be 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me compute \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and see what the sum of its coefficients is. Expanding \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem, we get \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for each term. The sum of the coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit confused because in the simpler example, I thought the coefficient would be zero, but that's because in \\((a + b)^2\\), there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be zero. But in our problem, \\((a + b)^4\\) does have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has a sum of coefficients 64, the coefficient becomes 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, to confirm, let me consider another example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\) would expand to \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) here is zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But if I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), then \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\) would have terms like \\(a^2c\\), \\(a^2/c\\), \\(2ab c\\), \\(2ab/c\\), \\(b^2c\\), \\(b^2/c\\). Again, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero. But in our problem, the first polynomial has an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so when multiplied by the second polynomial, each term in the second polynomial will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), would be the coefficient from the first polynomial times the sum of the coefficients from the second polynomial. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, I think the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Let's compute the entire product and see. But that might be too time-consuming, but maybe I can think of it as the product of two polynomials. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, alternatively, maybe I can think of the problem as finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, I think that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem and properties of polynomial multiplication.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " I think that part is multiplied by the first part, so the entire expression is the product of two expansions. But since the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't think I need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Wait, but let me make sure. The problem is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think the \\(c\\) terms won't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient remains 6. Wait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't sound right because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), we need to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms can only affect the power of \\(c\\)) in the second part. Wait, that's a better way to think about it. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is when the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel each other out. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving that, \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 120. Wait, but earlier I thought it was just 6, but now I'm getting 120. Which one is correct? Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6\\(a^2b^2\\), and when we multiply this by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in the other expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), 20, \\(15c^{-2}\\), etc. But since we're only interested in the term where the product results in \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, we need to multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by the term in the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\), which is 20. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think I was wrong earlier when I thought it was just 6. It's actually 120. Let me double-check that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that makes sense.

    "text": " I need to consider this part as well. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the entire term from the second part doesn't matter? Hmm, maybe not. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that would mean we're looking for the term in \\((a + b)^4\\) that gives \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because any term involving \\(c\\) would result in a term that includes \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which wouldn't just be a constant term. So, perhaps I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient 6 from the first part. That makes sense because the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by the constant term, so the coefficient would be 6 times that constant term. So, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by this constant term 20.

    "text": " I'm not sure if I need to expand this part too, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the \\(c\\) terms don't affect that? Wait, let me think. The entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply these two, each term in the first expansion will multiply each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I might only need to consider the terms where \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) multiply in such a way that the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, but I'm not sure. Wait, actually, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, maybe I just need to consider the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the sum of all the terms in the second part? But that doesn't make sense because each term in the first expansion will multiply each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't possible because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms, including those with different powers of \\(c\\). But that would still be a polynomial in \\(c\\), so maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would involve \\(c\\) terms, which aren't specified. So, let me assume that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\). Therefore, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, as I found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me use the binomial theorem again for this part. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, which means \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(6 = 2m\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, since the original expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is the product of the coefficients we found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n\n   Using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n\n   Using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " I need to consider this part as well. Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not involving \\(c\\). So, maybe I don't need to expand the entire expression with \\(c\\). Hmm, let me think. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when we multiply it by the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is another binomial expression. So, actually, the entire expression is the product of two binomial expansions. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but wait, that doesn't make sense because the terms involving \\(c\\) would affect other parts of the expression. Wait, no, actually, I think I might be overcomplicating it. Let me clarify: The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But in the product, the terms involving \\(c\\) are separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems off because the terms would multiply. Wait, no, perhaps it's more accurate to say that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that can't be right because each term in the expansion would be multiplied by each term in the other expansion. Wait, maybe I'm confusing how the multiplication works. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term comes only from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that seems plausible. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each of those terms will have a coefficient, and all those coefficients will add up to the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 (from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, to find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can set \\(c = 1\\), because substituting \\(c = 1\\) into the expression will make each term just its coefficient. So, \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so each term in that expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's just a scalar multiple, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expression, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems right. Let me see if there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the entire expression is a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But no, that's not quite accurate because each term in the product would be a combination of terms from both expansions. But since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would indeed be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributing their coefficients to the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient should be 6 * 64 = 384. Let me just verify my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 1. Expanded \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem and found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) to be 6. 2. Recognized that the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would contribute all its terms' coefficients to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. 3. Calculated the sum of the coefficients in the second expression by substituting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in 64. 4. Multiplied 6 by 64 to get 384. That seems correct. I think I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem and consider the contributions from each part of the expression.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2.

    "text": " I'm wondering if that part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, actually, when you multiply two expressions, the variables from each part are multiplied together. So, in this case, \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) are multiplied together. But \\(a^2b^2\\) only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply the two expansions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we need to find the term in the second expansion that is a constant, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because \\(c^0 = 1\\), which doesn't affect the variables. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That is, solve \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Let's do that: \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) implies \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to consider how the terms interact. Specifically, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but only the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, making the term have variables other than \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (the constant term). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives a constant term of 20. So, when you multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But only the constant term in the second expansion will not introduce any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so only that term will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. I don't think I made a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expansion being the product of two polynomials, and when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term in the second part.

But wait, that doesn't make sense because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering any specific term in \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to treat \\(c + 1/c\\) as a separate variable, but no, \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are distinct variables. So, when you multiply two polynomials, the exponents of different variables don't interfere. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and when you multiply by any term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), it would just multiply the coefficient by that term. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), maybe the answer is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not quite right either. Let me think again. No, actually, when you expand the entire expression, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting 1 for all variables. So, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the sum of coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too high. Let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), so the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, in that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). So, let me try that approach. First, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as before. Now, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem. \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the original problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in that case, it would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would mean the coefficient is 6 * \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a numerical value, not a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which would be 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would be a polynomial, not a single coefficient. Therefore, I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b)^4(c + d)^6\\), but no, it's as given. Let me try to clarify. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which are powers of \\(c\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As I calculated earlier, the sum of coefficients is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. Let me see if that makes sense. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, that would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to have \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but it's not specified. Let me think about it differently. If the problem had been \\((a + b)^4(c + d)^6\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + d)^6\\), which is 6 * 2^6 = 384. But in this case, it's \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a Laurent polynomial, but the approach is the same. So, perhaps the answer is 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 120. Hmm. Let me check the problem again: it's written as \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and the question is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) is some integer from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. Since the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to have \\(c\\) terms canceled out, so it's 120. Let me see if I can find more information. Wait, perhaps the problem is from a textbook or a standard problem set, and the answer is 120. Let me think again: in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. But the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so perhaps it's 384. Hmm, I'm a bit confused now. Let me try to see if I can find a way to reconcile this. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and then it's multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient becomes 6 times that coefficient. Therefore, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. But to be sure, let me check with a smaller exponent to see if this approach works. Suppose we have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{2}{2} = 1\\), and the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\) is \\((1 + 1) = 2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be 1 * 2 = 2. Let's expand it manually: \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\). Multiplying these together, we get \\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which has coefficients 1 and 1, so when we consider the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's 1 + 1 = 2, which matches our earlier calculation. So, applying the same logic, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

So, does that mean I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms at all? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), right? So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit confusing. Wait, no, because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), then any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), but the coefficient will just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, but that might not be correct. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in the expansion will be of the form (coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\)) times (coefficient from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)) times the corresponding variables. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we're looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponents of \\(c\\) can be anything. But wait, no, actually, when you multiply the two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, that can't be right because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, let's calculate that. If \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which includes terms with \\(c\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6*64=384. Hmm, but let me think if there's another way. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is just 6, but that doesn't make sense because the entire expression includes the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think differently. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), which we've found to have a coefficient of 6. Now, when we multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As I calculated earlier, that sum is 64, so 6*64=384. So, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me confirm this because sometimes when you have multiple variables, you might need to consider cross terms, but in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), their coefficients are independent. So, I think this approach is correct. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would indeed give a coefficient of 384 for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible \\(c\\) terms. So, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.

So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But that seems odd because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but that's not how coefficients usually work unless specified. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the terms where \\(c\\) cancels out, but that seems more complicated. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part and \\(c\\) is in another, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems to suggest that the coefficient itself is a polynomial, which is possible, but the problem might be expecting a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. That is, the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). So, perhaps I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by 6. Let me check that approach. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as before. Then, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The constant term would be the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, that makes sense because when you multiply the two parts, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, but only the constant term in the second part doesn't introduce any \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 20 = 120.

But that seems a bit odd because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\). Let me check that. The sum of coefficients in a polynomial \\(P(c)\\) is \\(P(1)\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\).

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's possible that the problem is considering the entire expression, and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of what happens with \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\).

But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6. But that seems too simple, and the problem includes the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part, so maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) (i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\)) in the entire expansion. That would make sense because then you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(c\\). Let me check that interpretation. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply them together. That would make sense. So, first, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 * 20 = 120\\). So, that would be the answer. Wait, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), it just asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm. So, maybe the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), which would mean that it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure because the problem didn't specify. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems complicated, and the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), which would be 120. Let me check both interpretations.\n\nFirst interpretation: The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nSecond interpretation: The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), so that would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think the more likely interpretation is the second one because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial, which is less likely to be the intended answer. So, I think the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me think about the structure of the expression. The expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, which is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense if the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the correct interpretation. Therefore, the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check this again. Let me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the constant term. As I did before, when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), \\(k = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term is 6 * 20 = 120. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 times the entire expansion, which would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems less likely because the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\). It just asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's 6.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's ambiguous whether it wants the coefficient as a polynomial in \\(c\\) or just the coefficient when considering \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). But in standard terminology, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term in a product of expressions, you usually consider the entire product and look for the term that matches exactly in all variables. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would imply that the term has \\(a^2b^2\\) and any possible combination of \\(c\\) terms. But that's not a single coefficient; it's a sum over coefficients. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let me think of it another way. If I consider the entire expression as a product of two polynomials, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of all products where the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the correct approach.\n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1)^1\\). Then, the expansion would be \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that would be zero as well. Alternatively, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), that would be 1 * 1 = 1. But in that case, the problem would have to specify that it's looking for \\(a^2\\) times \\(c^0\\). So, perhaps the problem is similar, asking for \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\). Therefore, I think the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me compute the entire expansion step by step. First, compute \\((a + b)^4\\). As before, the expansion is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). Now, compute \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, this is \\(c^6 + 6c^5 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c} + 15c^4 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^2} + 20c^3 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^3} + 15c^2 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^4} + 6c \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^5} + \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\). Simplifying, that's \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times (c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6})\\). So, that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to \\(6c^6 + 36c^4 + 90c^2 + 120 + 90c^{-2} + 36c^{-4} + 6c^{-6}\\). But that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense if the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120. So, that's the answer.\n\nTherefore, after all that, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\), is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms? Hmm, maybe not. Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so when we multiply the two expansions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part and the constant term (if any) in the second part. Wait, no, actually, when we multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by a term that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) from the second part. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about that. To find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can again use the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients: 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, let me just make sure I didn't miss anything. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. When we multiply these two, we get 6*20 = 120.

Wait, but the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply these two, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think that term must come from the product where the other part (the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part) contributes a constant term, meaning the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because if the exponent of \\(c\\) isn't zero, then the term would have some power of \\(c\\) and thus wouldn't be part of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me think about how to find that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). I need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the two coefficients: 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) and 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). Multiplying these together: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient should be 120. Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when we multiply these two parts, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by 20, giving a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20.

Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables from \\(c\\), so perhaps the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Let me think. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other terms involve \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables, maybe the coefficient remains the same. Wait, that doesn't seem right because when you multiply by the other expression, you might be adding coefficients from multiple terms. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me break it down.\n\nWait, no, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because then the coefficient would depend on all the terms in the second expansion. But actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply term by term. Wait, but in this case, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\) and the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which are separate variables, so when you multiply them, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is just multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), maybe we just take the coefficient from the first part and multiply it by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, that seems confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe the coefficient is the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) because the other terms involve \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that seems too simplistic. Wait, let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expression is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems plausible, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me check my reasoning. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, so perhaps it's just 6. But that seems too simple, and the problem includes both expressions, so I think the correct approach is to consider the entire product. So, if I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part (which is 64). Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me think of a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding this, we get \\(a \\times c + a \\times 1/c + b \\times c + b \\times 1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), and similarly for \\(b\\). So, in this case, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\), it's \\(c + 1/c\\), which is 2 when \\(c = 1\\). But in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. Yeah, I think that's the right approach. So, I'll go with 384 as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me check if I'm interpreting the problem correctly. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, in the product, each term is a combination of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and it's multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Since the second expansion has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), \\(1/c^6\\). The sum of the coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, yes, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient, not the entire expression, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, in which case it's just 6. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both expressions. So, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's in the entire product. So, yes, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 384.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) or something like that, but it's not specified. The problem just says \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's a separate variable. But that seems incorrect because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients combine. So, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when I multiply them, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with another approach. Let me consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial is multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is indeed 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because in the product, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, not the entire expression. So, perhaps it's 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384. Yeah, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest doesn't matter. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both expressions. So, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it's \\(a \\times c + a \\times 1/c + b \\times c + b \\times 1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), and the coefficient of \\(b\\) is also \\(c + 1/c\\). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is the same as in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second. Wait, no, the sum of coefficients in the second is 2, so if I set \\(c = 1\\), then the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2. But in reality, the coefficient is \\(c + 1/c\\), which isn't a constant unless \\(c = 1\\). So, perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384. So, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem is only considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) and ignoring the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient is just 6. But that seems too simple, and the problem includes both expressions, so I think it's more likely that the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression is being multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first expression (6) multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think of it as a generating function. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should expand both expressions separately and then multiply, but that would be time-consuming. Let me try to see if there's another approach. Wait, maybe I can consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When \\(c = 1\\), the expression becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), which is correct. So, the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient becomes 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nSo, after all this thinking, I believe the coefficient is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem and properties of polynomial multiplication.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."
