    "text": " Maybe I need to expand this part as well. But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), or maybe they do? Wait, no, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) with \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the \\(c\\) terms would multiply that term, but the coefficient itself is just the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, but actually, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second part, right? Or wait, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part? Wait, no, that can't be right because each term in the second part has different powers of \\(c\\), but the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is simply the coefficient from the first part, and the second part's expansion contributes a factor that doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, that might not be correct. Let me think again. When you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, for example, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), but when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms just tag along, but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second part. Wait, but the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in that expansion would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), because that would make each term just its coefficient. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and so the coefficient is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply by the second part, which has multiple terms, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which has a coefficient. Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, another way to think about it is that since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the \\(c\\) terms would just contribute a factor that's separate. So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6, and the \\(c\\) terms are multiplied as separate factors. But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, for example, if the first part is \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and the second part is, say, \\(c^6\\) with coefficient 1, then the product term would be \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\). Similarly, if the second part has a term with \\(c^5\\) and coefficient 6, then the product would be \\(6a^2b^2c^5\\), and so on. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by each coefficient from the second expansion, but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would actually be the sum of all those products. Wait, no, that's not right. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the entire second expansion, but since the second expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try a different approach. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can treat the two parts separately. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found earlier. The other part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the coefficient. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion, which would include all the \\(c\\) terms. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and the second part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by other variables. But that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Let me verify this. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as two separate binomial expansions and then see how the terms combine. So, in the first expansion, \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6. In the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficients in the second expansion are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to 6. The sum of these coefficients is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\), as we calculated before. Therefore, when you multiply the two expansions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Multiplying these gives 6 * 64 = 384.\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " I wonder if this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't directly affect the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, that might not be entirely correct. Because when you multiply the two expansions together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps we can treat the two parts separately. That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and then we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (since \\(c^0 = 1\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when we multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but only the term with \\(c^0\\) will contribute to the constant term in the overall product. Wait, no, actually, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Hmm, that's a different perspective. So, maybe the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and one in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), perhaps we can consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the question is asking for the coefficient in the product. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of those involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms from the second expansion. Wait, that doesn't make sense because coefficients are numerical, not polynomials. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, then multiply them together. Let me check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Now, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. To find that, we can use the binomial theorem again. Let me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the product of the two coefficients we found, we multiply 6 and 20 together. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but the problem didn't specify the power of \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean we're considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\)? That seems unlikely. I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), but that would mean the coefficient is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which isn't a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Alternatively, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But that seems odd because the question is likely expecting a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which would be 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just considering the coefficient in the polynomial ring, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make much sense because the coefficient is usually a scalar. So, I think the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Therefore, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 (i.e., \\(c^0\\)):\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients:**\n   Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), we multiply the coefficients from both parts:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " I'm not sure if this affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, perhaps when we multiply the two expressions together, the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) will only affect the coefficients of the terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe we can just consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and ignore the \\(c\\) terms? Wait, but that doesn't sound right because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps we can consider that when we multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because if we take any other term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), it will have some power of \\(c\\), either positive or negative, and that would make the entire term have a \\(c\\) component, which we don't want. So, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part by the constant term from the second part. So, first, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find the constant term, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Since these two terms are multiplied together in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and when we multiply by the constant term 20 from the other expansion, the product term is \\(6 \\times 20 \\times a^2b^2 \\times c^0\\), which is just \\(120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 120. Is there any possibility I missed something? Let me think. The problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I don't need to consider any other terms from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) because they would involve \\(c\\) and thus wouldn't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.

Wait, that can't be right because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Because otherwise, if it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so maybe I'm supposed to consider the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all possible terms from the second expansion. Wait, that seems complicated. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but perhaps it's expecting a numerical coefficient, which would mean that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms. But that would result in the coefficient being a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems unlikely. Wait, maybe the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, perhaps I should interpret the problem as asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the expansion. If that's the case, then I need to consider both expansions and find the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, let's proceed under that assumption. So, first, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), because when I multiply, I want the total exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0. So, let's expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, since the two expansions are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each expansion. So, that's 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm interpreting the problem correctly. The original problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the product. If it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any condition on \\(c\\), then in the product, each term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems odd because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a number. So, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be a number. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo, and the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the second part, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is multiplied in. So, I think the intended interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the answer.\n\nWait, but to double-check, let me consider the entire product. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and it's multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too high, and also, if the problem is asking for the coefficient regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's 384. But that contradicts my earlier thought. So, which is it?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the terms. Let me clarify. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then yes, every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems like a lot. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120, as I thought earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems more plausible because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But then, why would the problem mention \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) if it's just asking for the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\)? Maybe it's a trick question. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., \\(c^0\\), so the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, each term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is multiplied by a term in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Because when you expand, each term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me think again. When you have two separate polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which expands to terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. So, which is it? Let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me test this with a smaller example to see if this makes sense. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it's \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), so 1 * 2 = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) would also be 1 * 2 = 2. But if I look at the actual expansion, it's \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). So, the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are each 2, which matches 1 * 2. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, which is indeed 1 (from the first expansion) times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 2. So, applying this logic, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, that seems counterintuitive because when you multiply, the coefficients don't just add up like that. Wait, no, in the smaller example, it worked because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. So, that seems to hold.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120, as I calculated earlier. So, perhaps I should check both interpretations.\n\nFirst, the interpretation where we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384. Second, the interpretation where we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. To decide which is correct, let's see if the problem mentions anything about \\(c\\). It just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so it's likely that it's asking for the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\). Therefore, the answer would be 384.\n\nWait, but in the smaller example, when I set \\(c = 1\\), the sum of coefficients is 2, and that gives the correct coefficient for \\(a\\) as 2. So, in the original problem, setting \\(c = 1\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives \\(2^6 = 64\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me think again: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a term in one polynomial is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the second polynomial, but that's not a number, it's a polynomial. Wait, that can't be right because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, meaning the sum of all coefficients that are attached to \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. So, I'm confused now. Let me try to find a definitive way to approach this.\n\nLet me consider the entire expansion: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and it's multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, let me check this with a specific example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Expanding, it's \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), so 1 * 2 = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2 times 2 = 4, and the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) would be 1 * 2 = 2. So, in this case, the coefficients of \\(a^2\\), \\(ab\\), and \\(b^2\\) are each multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 2. So, that seems to confirm that the coefficient of a specific term in the first polynomial is multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial when considering the entire product.\n\nTherefore, applying this to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. So, which is correct? It depends on the interpretation of the problem. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 384. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. Since the problem didn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so 384.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. If I consider the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., down to \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be the sum of all those coefficients, which is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. So, perhaps the problem is intended to be the latter, but it's not clear. Let me see if the problem mentions anything about \\(c\\). It just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, without any mention of \\(c\\), it's ambiguous. But in most cases, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a term in a product involving multiple variables, it's usually considering the term with all variables to specific powers. So, perhaps the problem is asking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would make the coefficient 120.\n\nWait, but in the example I did earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) was 384, which is the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. So, perhaps that's the correct approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I can check by expanding a smaller version. Let me take \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). So, \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of coefficients of \\(a^2\\) times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, no, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't exist because the first expansion only goes up to \\(a^2b^0\\) and \\(b^2a^0\\). Wait, maybe I should take a different example.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). As before, it's \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 * (1 + 1) = 2, which matches the expansion \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, which is 1 * 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) is 2. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, which is 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nTherefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut I'm still confused because in the problem statement, it's not clear whether it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) or specifically \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Since the problem mentions \\(c\\), perhaps it's intended to be part of the term. So, maybe the correct answer is 120.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, meaning that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, the problem asks for the coefficient, which is a number, so that can't be the case. Therefore, it's more likely that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but in that case, the problem should have specified \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, perhaps the problem is intended to be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is miswritten, or I'm misinterpreting it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have \\(c\\) terms cancel out, so that the coefficient is a number. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I think the intended answer is 120, so I'll go with that.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\) gives \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficients from each expansion:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " I'm not sure if this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). Wait, but maybe I need to consider how this part contributes to the overall expansion. Let me think: when you multiply two expressions together, the coefficients multiply as well. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all, perhaps the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't matter. Wait, but that can't be right because the entire expression is multiplied together. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again: The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), right? Because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include all possible combinations where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by terms from the other expansion. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\), it would create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). But the problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply that we are looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, but the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because if the exponent of \\(c\\) isn't zero, then the term would be something else, not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product. That makes more sense. So, in other words, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That seems more accurate. So, to approach this, I think I need to consider both expansions: first, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) up to \\(a^2b^2\\), and then the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) up to the term where \\(c^0\\) is present, and then multiply the coefficients together. So, let's break it down.\n\nFirst, as I found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), I get \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term we're interested in. So, I need to find the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nTo find the constant term, I can again use the binomial theorem. Let's write it out:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get:\n\n\\(6 - 2m = 0\\)\n\n\\(2m = 6\\)\n\n\\(m = 3\\)\n\nSo, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the constant term. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) has a coefficient of 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient of 20. Since these two terms multiply together in the product, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) (which is just \\(a^2b^2\\)) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Is there any other term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that could contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term when multiplied by \\((a + b)^4\\)? For example, if there were negative exponents, would that affect the term? But no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is separate from \\(c\\), so the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by \\(c^0\\) from the second part. Any other term involving \\(c\\) would create a term with \\(c\\) in it, which wouldn't be just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think I'm correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, so when you multiply these together, you get 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120.\n\nWait, just to double-check, maybe I should consider the entire expansion and see if there's another way this could happen, but I don't think so because the variables are independent. So, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion is found by multiplying the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs at \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiplying these coefficients together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), I think the terms involving \\(c\\) won't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when we multiply the two expansions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of those involving \\(c\\).

So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, to find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can substitute \\(c = 1\\). Because when \\(c = 1\\), \\(1/c = 1\\), so the expression becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has coefficients, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term would contribute its own coefficient. So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part being 6, and since the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), when you multiply, each term in the second part just adds a coefficient to the existing \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so you have to sum all the coefficients of the second part and multiply by 6. So, yes, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but another way to think about it is that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so when you expand it, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first expansion, and it gets multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that makes sense. So, I think the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64.

So, maybe when we multiply the two expressions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from the terms involving \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think: when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we need to find how many times \\(a^2b^2\\) appears when multiplied by any term from the \\(c\\) part. But wait, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first part, and when multiplied by terms from the second part, it would create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot c^{-k}\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe the coefficient is just the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't seem right because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial in \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. It says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the product, but since the product also includes terms with \\(c\\), perhaps we're considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and we need the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then include terms with \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe the problem is only considering the coefficient in the context of the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts, and the \\(c\\) part is treated separately. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that's a bit ambiguous. Wait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, maybe it's considering the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that seems a bit involved. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the coefficient in the sense that we're treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but I don't think that's the case here. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^{-m}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6, depending on the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\) in the first part, the term would be \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{something}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, that might be it. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But that doesn't seem right either because the sum of coefficients in the second part would be when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 would be 384. But I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, but that's not possible because the product includes \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me try to approach it differently. Let's consider the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions. So, \\((a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first sum is multiplied by each term from the second sum. So, the general term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That would happen when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, this term is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, but only considering the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., where \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). So, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) implies \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the only term where the \\(c\\) exponent is zero is when \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), so \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient is 120. That seems more reasonable because it's a numerical value. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that reasoning. So, if I'm looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), then in the second expansion, I need the term where \\(c^0\\), which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient from the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Yes, that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient for this term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient for this term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from the two expansions:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

So, does that mean that when we multiply them together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will just be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? So, when we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\). So, maybe the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think about that. If we have two separate polynomials multiplied together, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), that term will come from \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and any term from the second part. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, but that might not be correct because the second part is not a constant. Alternatively, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient in the first part times the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're looking for a specific term, perhaps the \\(c\\) terms don't interfere. Let me clarify. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it becomes \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps it's just the product of the coefficients. Wait, no. Let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. So, in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and any term in the second polynomial. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, but that's not quite right because the second part isn't a constant. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps it's just the product of the coefficients. Wait, but that's not correct because the second part isn't a constant. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by terms that don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, maybe the coefficient is just 6, as we found earlier. But that seems too straightforward. Let me check. Let's consider the entire expression: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m}\\). Wait, that's not quite right. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when we multiply this by the first part, each term in the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\), so when multiplied, the terms become \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} \\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k} b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), which gives us \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for the second part, \\(c\\) can have any exponent, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, does that mean we have to sum over all possible \\(m\\)? Or does the \\(c\\) part not affect the coefficient? Wait, no, because each term in the product will have a specific power of \\(c\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is actually the sum over all possible \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But that seems incorrect because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, but that's not right because the second part isn't a constant. Let me think again. Wait, no, when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply to give that term. So, in this case, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to take the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by any term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is when we set \\(c = 1\\), because that's how we find the sum of coefficients. So, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) when \\(c = 1\\) is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but that seems high. Let me verify. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, the coefficient would just be the product of the coefficients, but that can't be because the second part isn't a constant. Wait, but when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). Hmm, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, the coefficient would be \\(6\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is treating all variables as separate, and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem only specifies \\(a^2b^2\\). That suggests that the coefficient is independent of \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the expression includes \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), and we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a constant multiplier, but that's not the case because the second part is a variable expression. Wait, no, that's not correct because the second part is a separate polynomial. So, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second part, each term contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But let me check that logic again. If I have two polynomials, \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in their product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). Because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). That makes sense because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{coefficient}\\). Therefore, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). So, in this case, \\(P(a, b)\\) is \\((a + b)^4\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. \\(Q(c)\\) is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and the sum of its coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but the problem is to find the coefficient in the entire product, so perhaps I need to consider whether the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are different variables, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the exponents of \\(c\\).

Wait, but that doesn't sound right. Because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, the second part can contribute any term, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate, the terms involving \\(c\\) don't influence the exponent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, but that's not quite correct. Because when you multiply, the entire term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term will be present in every term of the product where the first part is \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by every term from the second expression. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, what's the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Well, the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expression is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me double-check that logic. Because when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes only from the first polynomial, and the second polynomial can contribute any term, but since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are independent variables, each term in the product will have some combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). However, the problem is asking only for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that we're looking at the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the exponents on \\(c\\). So, in the product, each occurrence of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient accumulates. Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, but let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, the exponent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) doesn't affect \\(c\\), so when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's simply the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), times the entire expansion of the second part. So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not quite right because the problem is asking for the coefficient in the product, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but maybe that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it just gets multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient is 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second part). Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any consideration for \\(c\\). Wait, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so perhaps it's considering the entire product, but only looking at the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the exponents on \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me try another approach. Let's consider the entire product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\). Simplifying the second part, \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in the product is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for each such term, the exponent on \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\), where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the exponent on \\(c\\), we can consider that for each \\(m\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all terms would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Since \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, this sum becomes 6 times the sum from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(m = 6\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, since each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. When I multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which has a coefficient of 6, it will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand the product, each term will be a combination of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), I think that the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be present in the product, but multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be \\(6\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because each term in the product would have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms and \\(c\\) terms. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to see if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the entire expansion, any term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's effectively asking for the sum of all the coefficients that come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be \\(6\\) times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes from the first part, and when multiplied by the entire second expansion, each term in the product will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a term in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6 times 64 is indeed 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is just 6, but that seems unlikely because the entire expression includes both parts. Wait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's in the entire product, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 64. So, 6 times 64 is 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the \\(c\\) terms are separate and that the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is independent of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the expansion includes terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. The expression is a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part has a coefficient, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), it's like adding \\(a^2b^2\\) times each of those coefficients, so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all those coefficients multiplied by 6. So, that would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, that's the answer. But wait, let me check if that's correct by considering a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion would be \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 1 + 1 = 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would be 2 as well. So, in this case, the logic holds. Therefore, applying the same logic to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the product, each term would be of the form \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some exponent \\(k\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all \\(k\\) of the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. But since the coefficient from the first part is 6, and the sum over all coefficients in the second part is 64, then yes, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

Because when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part, but since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), any multiplication by other variables would change the term, so maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second part. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the second part is another binomial expansion, which includes terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, no, that's not correct either because each term in the second expansion is separate. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second.

Wait, no, that's not right because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second part, each of those will be separate terms, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expression. But that doesn't make sense because the second expression is not a single term. Wait, maybe I'm confusing things. Let me try a different approach. Let me consider that the entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and when multiplied by any term from the second part, it will result in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), etc. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not possible because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that's only in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it becomes \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) (something with \\(c\\)). So, unless the second part is 1, which it isn't, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) won't be present in the product unless we consider all possible combinations. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the question is considering only the part where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some term from the second part, but in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients from the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the sum of the coefficients in the second part is when \\(c = 1\\), which would be \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). But wait, no, that's not the case. Let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second part. But that would make the coefficient 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so perhaps the answer is 6 times the entire second part, but that seems odd because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that would make sense. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the middle term when \\(k = 3\\), because the exponents go from 6 down to -6 in steps of 2. So, the term where \\(c^{6 - 2k} = c^0\\) is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 times 20, which is 120. So, the answer is 120. Wait, that makes sense. So, to recap, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, so the combined coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems right.

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, is that right? Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the entire expression is a product, and when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the answer would just be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, is that correct? Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has multiple terms, each with their own coefficients. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's 6 multiplied by the entire expansion, which would make the coefficient 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me try another approach. Maybe I should consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and when you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I calculated earlier, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. But wait, let me check if that makes sense. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), so the \\(c\\) terms cancel out. In that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. That would be different. Let me see. So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as before. Then, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(c^0\\) is the middle term, which is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me find that term. Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the term is 20c^0, which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product would be 6 * 20 = 120. But wait, the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), it just said the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the expansion includes multiple terms. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, in the entire expansion, the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But earlier, when I thought about it, I considered that the sum of coefficients is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm correct in that approach. Let me think again: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and when multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. But wait, let me confirm by another method. Let's consider that \\((a + b)^4\\) is being multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the product is \\(\\sum_{i=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{i} a^{4 - i}b^i \\times \\sum_{j=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{j} c^{6 - j} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^j\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient when \\(i = 2\\) in the first sum, which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), multiplied by the sum over all \\(j\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{j}\\). Because each term in the first sum is multiplied by each term in the second sum, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by the entire expansion of the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. As before, the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that confirms it. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " I'm not sure how this affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\), maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term directly. So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is in the second part for the term that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\)? Wait, no, that might not be right. Let me think again. The entire expression is the product of two separate expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them together, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to consider only the terms from the second expansion that result in a constant term (i.e., where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero). Because if we have any \\(c\\) terms, then the product would involve \\(c\\) raised to some power, which isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. That makes sense because when you multiply the two expansions, the terms that contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the ones where you take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and \\(c^0\\) from the second part. So, let me focus on expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The general term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, it becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(k = 3\\) will give us \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. The coefficient for this term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Now, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion) gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed when \\(k=2\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}=6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(c^0\\) is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k=3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}=20\\). Multiplying them gives 6*20=120. That seems correct. I don't think I missed anything here. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For the term \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term occurs when \\(k=3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{120}"

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term, but in the product, it would be multiplied by all the terms from the other expansion, leading to terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps I need to consider that the \\(c\\) terms are separate. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, so each term in the product will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents and \\(c\\) exponents. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's possible that it's considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) exponents. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a combination of multiple terms. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, it doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\). Let me calculate that: when \\(c = 1\\), \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), meaning that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the question is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). That would make more sense because then it's a specific term. So, let me try that approach. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I can consider the product of the coefficients from each part that contribute to \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, from \\((a + b)^4\\), as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. From \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\), and we want this to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (assuming it's \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)) is 120. Wait, but the problem didn't specify the \\(c^0\\) part, so maybe I should consider both interpretations. If it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), then the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384, but if it's \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. But looking back at the problem statement: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), meaning that it's 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Hmm, maybe I should check both possibilities. Let me see: if I consider the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the product with every possible power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because otherwise, the coefficient would be a combination of terms with different powers of \\(c\\), which doesn't make much sense as a single coefficient. So, perhaps the correct answer is 120. Let me confirm that approach again. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), to get the term \\(a^2b^2\\), we take the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by every term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But if the problem is specifically asking for the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, I'm a bit confused now. Maybe I should look for similar problems or think about how coefficients work in products. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. So, in this case, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), we're looking at the product of terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) add up to 2 each. But since the second polynomial only involves \\(c\\), the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) only come from the first polynomial, and the exponents of \\(c\\) come from the second. So, in the product, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{m}c^{-n}\\), but I'm not sure that's helpful. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 * \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my approach. Wait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. I think I need to clarify this. Let me try to think of the entire product. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, each term in the product is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^{-m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the product as \\(a^2b^2c^m\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-m}\\) for various \\(m\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of the coefficients of all terms \\(a^2b^2c^m\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-m}\\). So, that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. But I'm not entirely confident because the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe that's the correct approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Hmm, I think I need to check both interpretations. Let me try to compute both possibilities.\n\nFirst, if we consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nIf we consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut since the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), perhaps the intended answer is 384. However, I think that's not the case because usually, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a term in a product involving multiple variables, it's referring to the term where all specified exponents are present, and the other variables are implicitly at their lowest or canceled out. So, perhaps the intended answer is 120. To be sure, let me think about it again.\n\nIn the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{-m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present as \\(a^2b^2c^m\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-m}\\) for various \\(m\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of the coefficients of all such terms. Since each of these terms has a coefficient of 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^m\\) or \\(c^{-m}\\) from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so that can't be right. Therefore, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. I think that makes more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial, not a number. So, I think the correct answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we first determine the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which happens at \\(k = 3\\), giving a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients together gives the final coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " I think this part is multiplied by \\((a + b)^4\\), so the entire expression is the product of these two expansions. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, that might not be right. Let me think. When you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we only need to consider the term in \\((a + b)^4\\) that has \\(a^2b^2\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that correct? Because if we take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and then multiply it by any term from the second part, that term will have some power of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply that we're considering the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, but what about the exponents of \\(c\\)? The problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it just wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Or perhaps it wants the coefficient when considering all possible terms, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, that would mean that we're looking for the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part and the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) in the second part. Because if we take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by, say, \\(c^k\\) from the second part, then the term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to get a term that's exactly \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to multiply it by the term in the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. Therefore, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, first, as I found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me apply the binomial theorem again here. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients: 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent is 0 is when \\(m = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together, 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), and then finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).

    "text": " This part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so maybe I don't need to expand it because I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply these two expansions together, I'll be combining terms from each expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider how that term is formed when multiplying by the other expansion. Let me think: when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since I'm only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient will be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that correct? Actually, no. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, and the variables are combined. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion by the constant term (i.e., the term without \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\)) from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense. So, I need to find two things: 1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found as 6. 2. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on the second part now. The expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because \\(c^0 = 1\\), which is the constant term. So, I need to solve for \\(m\\) in the equation \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Let me do that: \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) implies \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the constant term. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients I found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, I expanded \\((a + b)^4\\) and found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) correctly as 6. Then, for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I used the binomial theorem and correctly identified that the term with \\(c^0\\) occurs at \\(m = 3\\), giving a coefficient of 20. Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. That seems correct. I don't think I made any calculation errors here.

    "text": " I'm not sure how this part interacts with the first part. I mean, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient is just 6? Wait, no, because the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply as well. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all, that would mean that we're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that makes sense because when you multiply, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, but only the term with \\(c^0\\) will result in a term that's just a constant, so that the combined term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Therefore, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to do that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). I need the exponent to be zero, so I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(m = 3\\) will have \\(c^0\\). The coefficient for this term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Since these are multiplied together in the product, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, does that make sense? Let me double-check. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when you multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, resulting in 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Hmm, I think that's correct. Let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent is zero is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire expression, isn't \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term from the second part? So, is there any other consideration I need to make? For example, does the second part have any other terms that could affect the coefficient? I don't think so because the second part is multiplied as a whole, so when you expand the entire product, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, then yes, only the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and the constant term from the second part contribute to that specific term.

But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each of those will contribute a term with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second part. Wait, but actually, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because each term in the second expression contributes its coefficient times \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to find the total coefficient, I need to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the sum of the coefficients in the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, in this case, setting \\(c = 1\\), the sum of the coefficients would be \\((1 + 1/1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be 6 times 64, but if we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), then we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is the middle term. Let me think again. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), the sum of all coefficients is 64, but if I'm only looking for the term where \\(c^0\\) is present, that is, the constant term, then that would be the coefficient when the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, that makes more sense because if you're just looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but actually, in the product, each term would have some power of \\(c\\), so unless specified, the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 * 64 = 384. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 120. Hmm, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so I think it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too high. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would include all powers of \\(c\\), which would just be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. But the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so perhaps it's just 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in the entire product, every term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) ranges from -6 to 6, in steps of 2, I think. But the problem is only interested in the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\), so \\(k = 2\\), and then the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second part). The sum of coefficients in the second part is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384. But earlier, I thought it might be 120, but that was if we were looking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Since the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), I think it's 384. Wait, but let me confirm. Let's think about the expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, each term in the second part is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all the coefficients from the second part, because each term contributes its coefficient times \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second part) = 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think the answer is 384. But to make sure, let me compute the sum of coefficients in the second part again. The sum of coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1/1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you have two independent polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one part is multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the other part. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider expanding both parts and see how it works. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), when expanded, has terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\), in steps of 2. The sum of all coefficients is 64, as calculated earlier. So, when you multiply each term in the first part by each term in the second part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have multiple variables, you might need to consider cross terms, but in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), their coefficients don't interfere. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the product of the coefficients from each part, where the first part's coefficient is 6, and the second part's total coefficient sum is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would have been 6 * 20 = 120, because the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. But since it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you have the product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, that's 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the binomial expansion of each part. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. The expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a sum of coefficients equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\) when \\(c = 1\\).\n\n3. Multiply the coefficients from both parts: \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " I need to consider this part as well. Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which are variables in the first part. The second part has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when multiplied together, the entire expression would have terms involving both \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). But since the problem is only asking about \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the coefficient is just 6, and the rest of the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect it? Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times whatever the sum of all the coefficients in the second part is. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term will contribute a factor, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe we just need to multiply 6 by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, but actually, no. Wait, no, because the variables are separate. The first part is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part is in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply the two expressions, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, each contributing a different power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that is, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). Wait, but that can't be, because the variables are separate. Wait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. Because otherwise, if it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), then it's multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which would include various powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Hmm, perhaps I need to clarify that. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. But since the product is of two expressions, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\), when you multiply them, the variables are separate. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient in the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, but that can't be right because the second part has coefficients as well. Wait, no, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part. But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps it's just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. Wait, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), because that would make each term equal to its coefficient. So, let me calculate that. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the two parts are multiplied together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part contributes a coefficient that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, as I thought earlier, the coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384. But let me check that again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, it's just 6, because the \\(c\\) part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. But that seems contradictory because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients do multiply. So, for example, if you have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\), and you multiply it by, say, \\(c^6 + 6c^5 + 15c^4 + 20c^3 + 15c^2 + 6c + 1\\), which is the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) when written as a polynomial in \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would have terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\), but if we write it as a polynomial, it's from \\(c^6\\) to \\(c^0\\), but with negative exponents as well. Wait, actually, no, when you expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you get terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, it's symmetric around \\(c^0\\). So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which has a coefficient of 6, when multiplied by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., down to \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term on its own, and the \\(c\\) terms are separate. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. That would make sense. So, in that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Now, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the middle term when expanded, which is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. To find this, we can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the answer is 120. Wait, let me confirm that. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by \\(c^0\\) from the second part, giving \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), and the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."
