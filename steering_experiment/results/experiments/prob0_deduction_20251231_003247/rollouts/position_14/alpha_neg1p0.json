    "text": " Hmm, but wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean I don't have to consider the \\(c\\) terms? Or do I need to multiply the coefficients from both expansions? Wait, actually, the entire expression is the product of two binomials: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, right? Because the second part has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are separate variables. So, when you multiply them together, the terms would involve combinations of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply, every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\((a + b)^4\\). However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that would mean we're looking for the term in \\((a + b)^4\\) that gives \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the entire expression would have terms with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the terms that contribute to it. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems like it would be an infinite series, which doesn't make sense because the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Oh, I think I see now. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). Let me check that: If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 64 (the sum of coefficients in the other part). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Another way to think about it is: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), that means we need to multiply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing their own coefficients. So, indeed, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being the product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the coefficient should be 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " But wait, the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part of the expression involves \\(c\\). So, does that mean I need to consider the entire expression, or just the first part? Hmm, because the entire expression is a product of two parts: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Because actually, the entire expression is a product, so each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. But since the first part's term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), when I multiply it by the entire second expansion, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion will just be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when I multiply it by the entire second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, does that mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion? Wait, that might not be correct either because the second expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not about any specific power of \\(c\\). So, actually, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the product would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term from the second expansion, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has terms with different powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all terms in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. Wait, but that can't be right because the second expansion has a finite number of terms, each with their own coefficients. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, in this case, setting \\(c = 1\\), the sum of the coefficients would be \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the exponents of \\(c\\) would change, but if the problem is only asking about \\(a^2b^2\\) without any restriction on \\(c\\), then the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But let me think again: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only one term, and when multiplied by the second expansion, it's just 6 times the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6 is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems correct, but I'm a bit unsure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering any \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is just 6, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is being multiplied in. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try another approach. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanded, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we are looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), which gives us \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for each \\(m\\) from 0 to 6, the term will be multiplied by \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), and the exponent of \\(c\\) will be \\(6 - 2m\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\), the coefficient will be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). So, that's 6 times the sum from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(m = 6\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). The sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems to be the same result as before. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. In that case, we would need to find the terms where \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that's different. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. But the original problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without mentioning \\(c\\). So, perhaps it's 384, but that seems too large. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, so 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". It doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire second expansion, but that's not standard. Typically, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term in a product of two expressions, you're looking for the coefficient of that term in the product, considering all variables. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part and \\(c\\) is in the other, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient remains 6. But that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that can't be right because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire second expansion. But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is separate, but that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me try to parse it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of the two expressions. So, in the product, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first expansion, and it's multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the coefficient is 6 * sum of coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, since the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by this term, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " But wait, the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which are terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The part with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so does that mean I can treat them separately? Hmm, maybe I can just multiply the coefficients from each part because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply as well. Let me think: If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the part from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) must be a constant term, right? Because if it's not a constant, then the term would involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which we don't want. So, I think I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me check that logic. So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel each other out. Let me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, it becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, I need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero for the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we've found that the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6 and the constant term from the other part is 20, then the overall coefficient is 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. Let me just double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and is multiplied by the constant term from the other expansion. Since the constant term is 20, multiplying 6 by 20 gives 120. I think that makes sense.

Wait, no, that might not be correct because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But in this case, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, perhaps I need to consider the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that results in a term without \\(c\\). Wait, but how does that work? Let me think again. Let me denote the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, to get a term that is \\(a^2b^2\\), it must come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by some term from the second part that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), but only \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Wait, no, actually, the second part is entirely in terms of \\(c\\), so when I multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. But wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second expansion might have multiple terms, but we are only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(c^0\\) is the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), which would make the overall term \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1\\). So, I think that's the right approach. So, first, let me find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, I need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(m=3\\) is the one with \\(c^0\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me double-check that. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. When we multiply these two expressions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only consider the term where the second part contributes a \\(c^0\\), which is 20. So, the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe I should think of the entire expression as the product of two polynomials, and when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all possible products where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) add up to 2 each, and the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) add up to zero. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only contribution comes from the term where the second part is \\(c^0\\), which is 20, and the first part's coefficient is 6, so 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that makes sense. So, I think the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break it down into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\) in the binomial expansion:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   We look for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0.

    "text": " Hmm, but wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe the other part doesn't affect this term. Let me think. Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part of the expression is multiplied by this, perhaps the entire expression is a product of two expansions: one involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since we're only interested in the term with \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), maybe the coefficient is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) for the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), but that seems a bit confusing. Wait, actually, when you multiply two polynomials together, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by every term from the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps that's only the coefficient from the first part, and the second part's terms would affect other parts of the expansion, but not the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right because when you multiply the two expressions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by all the terms in the second expression, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to clarify. When you expand \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you can consider it as the product of two separate expansions. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those will contribute to different terms in the final product. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would mean that we are considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because each term in the product will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms and \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) terms. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible terms with \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient would be multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, that might be the case. Let me think again. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), as we found earlier. The other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). Now, when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, you'll get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only consider the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero because otherwise, it's not just \\(a^2b^2\\), but \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is just 1. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, let me find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the term with \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, when we have \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Since these two are multiplied together in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only include the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, right? Because otherwise, it's a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is a different term. So, yes, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the entire product is a product of two polynomials, so each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term from the second part. But when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, we're only interested in the terms where the product results in \\(a^2b^2\\) times some \\(c\\) terms, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be a specific term, not all terms. So, perhaps my initial approach is correct: that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". If it's in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a term that's multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the products where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But actually, no, because each term in the product will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only multiplied by the constant term (c^0) in the second expansion, because otherwise, it would have a c term attached. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some k, then it would be different, but as it stands, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think the correct approach is to multiply the coefficient from the first part by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which gives 120.\n\nWait, but let me check the second expansion again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when 6 - 2m = 0, m = 3, as I had before. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So that's correct. So, yes, the coefficient is 20 for \\(c^0\\). Therefore, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but another thought: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, if I have (6a^2b^2) * (20) = 120a^2b^2, so the coefficient is indeed 120. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20.\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together to get 6 * 20 = 120, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in that reasoning.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " But wait, the term we're interested in is \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, does that mean the coefficient is just 6? Hmm, maybe, but let me think again. Wait, no, because the entire expression is a product of two parts: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that term is only present in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), right? Because the second part only has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. But the question is, do we need to consider any terms from the second part when looking for \\(a^2b^2\\)? Wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all. So, when we multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), it's just the product of 6 and the entire second expansion. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), so maybe we're supposed to consider that in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion. Because if the second expansion had a term with \\(c^0\\), that would contribute to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Otherwise, if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by, say, \\(c^3\\) or \\(c^{-2}\\), that would give terms like \\(a^2b^2c^3\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), which aren't \\(a^2b^2\\) alone. So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to find the constant term (the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient from the first part, which is 6. So, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). Therefore, the constant term is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me double-check that. So, the coefficient from the first part is 6, and the constant term from the second part is 20, so when you multiply them, you get 120, which would be the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term. Since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and it's multiplied by the constant term, that should be correct. Alternatively, if I think about the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and it's multiplied by all the terms in the second part, but only the constant term contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms.

Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so that the entire term is \\(a^2b^2\\). That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would involve \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the problem is implicitly asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. That would make sense. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. So, let me break it down. First, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the term with \\(c^0\\), you get \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1 = a^2b^2\\), which is the term we're interested in. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to find that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the exponent to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\).

When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial.

So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that might not be correct because the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is obtained by setting all variables to 1. Let me check that. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me think again. Is that correct? Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term is a different power of \\(c\\). So, in the final product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes to a different term in the final product when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, but let me verify this approach because sometimes when variables are involved, you have to consider cross terms, but in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), I think this approach is correct. Alternatively, maybe I should think of the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Since the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term contributes a different power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would just be the product of the coefficients. So, I think my initial approach is correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me double-check by considering the expansion more carefully. Let me write out the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, it's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in this expansion has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) and a power of \\(c\\) equal to \\(6 - 2m\\). Now, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (regardless of the power of \\(c\\)) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion. Since the coefficient from the first part is 6, and the sum of the coefficients from the second part is 64, as I calculated earlier, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct answer. Alternatively, to confirm, maybe I can compute the entire product and see. But that would be time-consuming. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a product, and since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be the product of the coefficients from each part, considering that the second part's coefficients sum up to 64. So, yeah, I think 384 is the correct coefficient.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n3. Multiplying these results gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " Hmm, but wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean the other part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), right? So, when we multiply the two expressions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can consider that term separately and the other part would just contribute a factor that's multiplied by it. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not any specific term involving \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part and \\(c\\) is in the second part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second part's expansion. But the problem doesn't specify any particular term involving \\(c\\), so perhaps the answer is just 6. Wait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the problem again: it says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the product. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by every term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, that doesn't sound right because the second expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), so when we multiply, each term would have different variables. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, maybe the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Let me think about that. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but is that correct? Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first polynomial, and the second polynomial contributes all its terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384. Let me verify that. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that when multiplying two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first polynomial and \\(c\\) is in the second, there's no overlap in variables, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, I think 384 is correct. Wait, but let me think again. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = 6a^2b^2 + \\text{other terms}\\). Then, when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which expands to terms like \\(c^6, 6c^4, 15c^2, 20, 15c^{-2}, 6c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\), etc., the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each of these terms, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6, 36a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 36, and so on. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on the power of \\(c\\). Wait, but that's not possible because \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), so each term would have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is miswritten, or maybe I'm misunderstanding it. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but that doesn't make sense because each term in the product includes both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms and \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought earlier. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in the second expansion. Let me check that. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let's find that. Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying any \\(c\\) terms. Hmm. I think the correct interpretation is that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm a bit confused because usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term in a product, it's referring to the term with that exact combination of variables. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, each contributing a different power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Therefore, I think the answer is 384. Wait, but let me double-check. Let's consider that the entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which has some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Since the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64, as found earlier, then the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem didn't specify any \\(c\\) terms, so I'm not sure. Hmm, maybe I should clarify. Since the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any mention of \\(c\\), I think it's safe to assume that they just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to look at it is that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the second polynomial isn't a scalar. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficient is just the coefficient from the first part, 6, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that can't be right because when you multiply polynomials, each term in one affects all terms in the other. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion without considering the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6, but that seems unlikely because the \\(c\\) terms are part of the product. I'm a bit confused, but I think the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Suppose I set \\(c = 1\\). Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 * 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this case would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, that supports the earlier conclusion. Therefore, I think the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be \\(c + 1/c\\), but if I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's the sum of coefficients of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which is 2. So, in this case, the coefficient would be 2. Similarly, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in the example I just did, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then the expression becomes \\((a + b)(2)\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, which matches the sum of coefficients in the second part. So, that seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " Hmm, but wait, the problem is about \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, maybe I don't need to worry about the second part?

So, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will multiply each term from the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider how that term interacts with the second part. Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the first expansion, and the second expansion has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, the result will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot c^{-k}\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, actually, that's not quite right. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. But the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand this product, each term will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion, when multiplied by any term from the second expansion, will give terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would require that the second part contributes a factor that doesn't change the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, but actually, the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\), so when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents remain the same, but the \\(c\\) terms vary. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that the entire expression's \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by the sum of all the terms from the second expansion. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is separate. Let me clarify: The entire expression is a product of two expansions. So, when I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and when I expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When I multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first will multiply each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will multiply every term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{k-1}\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that we are looking for the coefficient when \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 1 (i.e., the constant term in the second expansion). Because if the second expansion has a term with \\(c^0\\), which is 1, then multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by that term would give \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1 = a^2b^2\\), and the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from both expansions. Alternatively, if the second expansion doesn't have a constant term, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be zero because there's no term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) to combine with \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but let me check: does \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) have a constant term? Let me expand it using the binomial theorem. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponents of \\(c\\) are \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the exponent to be zero for the constant term, so set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). Therefore, the constant term is 20. So, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion by the constant term 20 from the second expansion, we get \\(20a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 20 times the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion, which was 6. So, 20 times 6 is 120. Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20, so when you multiply these together, you get 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Hmm, but wait, is that correct? Because when you multiply the two expansions, every term in the first expansion gets multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by all terms from the second expansion, but only the constant term from the second expansion will contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. All other terms from the second expansion will have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, so they won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Let me think about it differently. Suppose I consider the entire expression as a product of two polynomials. The first polynomial has terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second has terms in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When I multiply them, the variables are independent, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the constant term (if any) in the second polynomial. Since the second polynomial does have a constant term, which is 20, the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense.

    "text": " Hmm, but the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, does that mean that the coefficient is just 6, and the rest of the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect it? Let me think. No, actually, I think I might have misread the problem. Wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two expansions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because any term multiplied by 1 (since \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by each term in the other expansion) would just add up all the coefficients. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me clarify. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. But in this case, we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), and in the other polynomial, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms are in terms of \\(c\\), so they don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and this term doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we need to consider how many ways \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, actually, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the product will be of the form \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{-k}\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), that would require that the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because that's the only term that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will result in a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, let's compute both of these. First, as I found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, we multiply the two coefficients we found: 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) and 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(c^0\\) is when the exponent is zero, which happens when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about it another way. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), it's equivalent to taking the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, but wait, no, because each term in the second part is a power of \\(c\\), so unless we're looking for a specific term, the coefficients don't just add up. But in this case, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so it's not the sum of all coefficients, but specifically the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which we found to be 20. So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break it down into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The exponent of \\(c\\) is zero when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\).

    "text": " Hmm, but wait, the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the part with \\(c\\) doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. When we multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) would be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, actually, that's not quite right. Because the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire product, so when you multiply the two expressions, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is when it's multiplied by a term that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Wait, but in this case, the second expression only involves \\(c\\), so when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expression, it will still be \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think that means regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, essentially, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not considering the \\(c\\) terms, maybe the answer is just 6. But wait, that doesn't seem right because the second expression might have multiple terms, and each would contribute to the overall coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, actually, no. Because in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, which are all different powers of \\(c\\). But when we collect like terms, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can be present is if we multiply it by a term that is \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something like that. Wait, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me try to clarify. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, that means we need to consider all possible terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). Wait, but that's not possible because the second expression only involves \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expression, the exponents of \\(c\\) will vary, but the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will remain 2. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. That would make more sense because otherwise, if we're just looking for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second expression, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient. So, maybe I should interpret it as finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply those two coefficients together. Let me check that approach. So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), as I found earlier. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we have terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the exponent to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we multiply the coefficients from each part. So, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)) gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (assuming it's multiplied by \\(c^0\\)) is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't misinterpret the problem. The original problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a number. Since the problem asks for the coefficient, which is typically a number, I think the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, meaning \\(c^0\\), so that the term is purely \\(a^2b^2\\). That makes sense because otherwise, the coefficient would depend on \\(c\\), which is not the case here. So, I think 120 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me go through it again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, first, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Then, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(k = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, I think the correct approach is to consider the \\(c^0\\) term, making the coefficient 120.\n\nSo, I think I've got it. The coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term \\(c^0\\) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   - The term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   - The constant term \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(k = 3\\), giving a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   - \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

The entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply them together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), not \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second.

But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if you take any other term from the second expansion, it would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, which would make the term have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something, which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to get the exact term \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). How do I find that? Well, again, using the binomial theorem. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k - k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(c\\) equal to \\(6 - 2k\\). The constant term is when the exponent is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\) so \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is the term when \\(k = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 20, which is 120. Wait, so that's the final answer? Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, first, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when you multiply these two parts, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, giving a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense. I think that's correct.

When you have two separate polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are only in the first polynomial, so their coefficients are only affected by the first polynomial. The second polynomial, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms involving powers of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that can't be, because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, meaning considering all possible terms, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second polynomial. But that seems too broad. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is a product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Since the sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives us \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is a separate factor, so the coefficient remains 6. But that seems contradictory because the entire expression is the product, so the coefficient would be multiplied by the second part. Hmm, I'm not sure. Let me try to look for similar problems or think about how coefficients work in products. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first polynomial, any term involving \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) can't come from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But since the second polynomial isn't a single term, the coefficient isn't just a number but a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Since the sum of coefficients is 64, as I calculated earlier, then the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. That seems more likely, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to think differently. Suppose I expand both parts:\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nSecond, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, the product would be:\n\n\\((a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4) \\times \\left(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\right)\\).\n\nNow, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial. When multiplied by the second polynomial, this term becomes \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire second polynomial. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, perhaps they mean the coefficient when considering all terms, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe they're asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is separate. But the problem includes both parts, so I think it's more likely that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is indeed found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 384. But I'm not entirely sure because the problem could be interpreted in different ways. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), then the coefficient would be 6 * \\dbinom{6}{k} where \\(6 - 2k\\) is the exponent of \\(c\\). But since the problem doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), it's probably asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 384.\n\nWait, but another thought: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first polynomial, and \\(c\\) is only in the second, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, perhaps they mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. So, I think the correct interpretation is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Suppose I consider the entire product as a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. So, if I write the product as:\n\n\\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\left(\\sum_{i=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{i} a^{4 - i}b^i\\right) \\times \\left(\\sum_{j=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{j} c^{6 - j} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^j\\right)\\).\n\nThen, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the entire second sum, which is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but considering that the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so the coefficient remains 6.\n\nWait, but that contradicts the idea that when you multiply polynomials, the coefficients combine. So, perhaps the correct answer is 6, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6. But I'm not entirely sure. I think I need to clarify.\n\nWait, let's consider an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1)^1\\). The expansion would be \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product is zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, that's not helpful. Alternatively, if I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (1 + 1)\\), which is \\((a + b)^2 \\times 2\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be 2, \\(ab\\) would be 4, and \\(b^2\\) would be 2. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 2, which is the coefficient in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial (which is 2). So, applying that logic, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with another example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1)^1\\). The expansion is \\((a + b)(c + 1) = ac + a + bc + b\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1\\), which is the coefficient in the first polynomial (1) times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial (2). So, 1 * 2 = 2, but in reality, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. So, in that case, the coefficient isn't just a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, which suggests that the answer is 6, the coefficient in the first part, and the second part is separate.\n\nBut in the earlier example, the coefficient of \\(a\\) becomes a polynomial, so perhaps in this problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so maybe it's only 6. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that \\(c\\) is another variable, and the coefficient is just 6. Hmm, I'm still confused.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first polynomial, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as in the first polynomial, which is 6, and the second polynomial doesn't affect it. Therefore, the coefficient is 6.\n\nBut in that case, why include the second part? It seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem doesn't specify. So, perhaps it's just 6. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be 6 times the entire second polynomial, but since that's a polynomial, it's not a number. Therefore, perhaps the answer is 6.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first polynomial, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient in the first polynomial, which is 6, multiplied by 1 (since there's no \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) in the second polynomial). Therefore, the coefficient remains 6.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6, because the second polynomial doesn't contain \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so it doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, but now I'm thinking it's just 6. Which one is correct?\n\nLet me think of it this way: when you have two polynomials, say \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), then the product \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\) will have terms that are products of terms from \\(P\\) and terms from \\(Q\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the entire \\(Q(c)\\). But if we're treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient as a numerical value, regardless of \\(c\\), then perhaps they mean the coefficient in \\(P(a, b)\\), which is 6.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written in a way that \\(c\\) is another variable, and we're supposed to treat the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times \\(Q(c)\\), but since \\(Q(c)\\) is a polynomial, the coefficient isn't a single number but a polynomial itself. Therefore, the problem might be asking for the coefficient in the first part, which is 6.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, perhaps they just want the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that the entire expression is a product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the entire second polynomial, but since the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, perhaps they mean 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think I need to make a decision here. Given that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and considering that the second polynomial doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just 6, because the second polynomial doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the answer is 6.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\), then the product is a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) would appear in the product as \\(6a^2b^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6(c + 1/c)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps they mean the coefficient in front of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is \\(6(c + 1/c)^6\\). But that's not a number. Alternatively, if they want the coefficient as a numerical value, perhaps they mean the coefficient when considering all possible terms, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Since the sum of coefficients is 64, then 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that's the correct approach because when you multiply by the entire second polynomial, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) becomes 6 times each term in the second polynomial, and if you're considering the coefficient regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. The sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is indeed found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, since the entire second polynomial \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by this term, the coefficient is multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. Setting \\(c = 1\\), the sum of the coefficients is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

That makes me think that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the part involving \\(c\\) doesn't affect it. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because then the coefficient would be 6 times something, but I think that's not the case. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, when I expand the entire expression, any term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, no, because the coefficient is just a numerical factor, and any term involving \\(c\\) would make the term have \\(c\\) raised to some power, which isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient isn't a single number, which doesn't make sense. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to approach it differently. The expression is a product of two separate binomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, their exponents don't interfere with each other. So, when you expand the product, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the question is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all possible terms, but that's not how coefficients work. Wait, no, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because usually, when you're asked for a coefficient, it's a numerical value. So perhaps the problem is actually just \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we're supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would indeed be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that feels off because the answer would then be a polynomial, not a single number. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient remains 6. But that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product, so each term in the product would have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is actually the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), multiplied by 6. But wait, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients of a polynomial is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, that seems plausible. Let me check that again. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Then, when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, which means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the sum of the coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which is 2^6 = 64, then 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384. But wait, let me think again. Is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part? Or is it more nuanced? Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in the original polynomials. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire second polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, that's not possible because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by terms involving \\(c\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself doesn't exist in the product unless multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, perhaps I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That makes more sense. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That seems correct. So, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already determined is 6. Next, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do that, we can use the binomial theorem again. Let me write that out: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\) => \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, multiplying the two coefficients together: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times 20 (from \\(c^0\\)) gives 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 120. Therefore, the answer should be 120. Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) correctly using the binomial theorem, which is 6.

    "text": " I don't think this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, maybe the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't influence the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the product of both expressions. So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is from the second part when multiplied by 1, but actually, no, because the second part is multiplied by the first part. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). Therefore, when multiplying the two expressions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient from the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term, you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant. Alternatively, maybe the constant term is 1, so the coefficient remains 6. Wait, let me check that. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the term where the exponent is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, that means the constant term is 20. Therefore, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the constant term from the other expression. So, that's 6 times 20, which is 120. Wait, is that correct? Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and the second part, when expanded, has a constant term 20. So, when we multiply these two expressions, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, resulting in \\(20a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 20 times 6, which is 120. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the variables are separate, so maybe the coefficients just multiply. Let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I should think of the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficients multiply when you take the product of terms from each expansion. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient for \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) in the second part is 20, so the product is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. So, I think that's the answer. But just to be thorough, let me write it out step by step again.\n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\), so \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\).\n\nNext, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, using the binomial theorem, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{3} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^3 = \\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second expansion, resulting in \\(20a^2b^2\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 20 * 6 = 120.\n\nWait, but I'm just making sure I didn't miss anything. Is there any other term in the second expansion that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by terms from the first expansion? No, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, only the constant term from the second expansion affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, 120 is indeed the correct coefficient.\n\nSo, I think I've got it. The coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\n3. **Combining the results**:\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to see if the second part contributes any factors that affect this term. Wait, the second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), and the first part is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when we multiply them, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), which is a different variable, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the product of the coefficient from the first part and the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, that can't be right because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion is a product of a term from the first binomial and a term from the second binomial. So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), it would come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part by every term in the second part. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), which is a different variable, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the same as the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression in \\(c\\). Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" Oh, wait, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a product, and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because \\(c\\) and \\(a, b\\) are different variables. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but since \\(a, b, c\\) are all different, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second part. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which seems odd. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanded, each term in the product will be of the form \\( \\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m \\), which simplifies to \\( \\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m} \\). Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need to find all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, which means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for each such term, we also have a factor from the second part, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient would be the sum over all possible \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because each term in the product would have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), which is \\(6 \\times 2^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that seems too high. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but since it's not specified, perhaps the problem is only considering the \\(a^2b^2\\) term and treating the rest as coefficients. Wait, but the problem is written as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so perhaps it's treating the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number. Hmm, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should look at it differently. Let's consider that the expression is a product of two independent binomial expansions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial. But the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", implying a numerical coefficient. So, maybe the problem is only considering the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, and the rest is ignored. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is in factoring the entire expression, and we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the combined expansion, which would involve summing over all possible contributions from the second part. Wait, maybe the problem is that the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by each of these terms, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by each of these powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, in the entire expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part. Because each term in the product would be \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second part multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\). But the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m=0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but that seems like a lot. Let me check. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is \\(6 \\times\\) the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is miswritten, or I'm misinterpreting it. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That would make sense because then we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the entire product. That would mean we need to find the term where in the first expansion, we have \\(a^2b^2\\), and in the second expansion, we have \\(c^0\\). So, let's calculate that. From the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). From the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is the middle term, which is when the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out. So, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(m = 3\\), because each term is \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, setting \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the term with \\(c^0\\) is \\(20 \\times c^0 = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the answer is 120. Wait, but earlier I thought the answer might be 384, but that was when considering all terms. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), but not specifying anything about \\(c\\), then perhaps the coefficient is indeed 384, because each term in the product would have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), and the coefficient would be the sum over all those terms. But that seems odd because the coefficient is usually a scalar, not a polynomial. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense. Therefore, I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That would make the coefficient a number, 120, which seems more reasonable. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, and the rest is ignored, but that would mean the coefficient is 6, which seems too low. Wait, but the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, perhaps the way to interpret this is that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a, b\\) and one in \\(c\\). Therefore, when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. So, I think the answer is 120. Let me confirm. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.

The other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), involves \\(c\\), so does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, I think so. Because the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so when you multiply them together, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider how that term interacts with the other expansion. Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\). So, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term from the second expansion, each product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\), depending on the term. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps we don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms? Wait, no, because the entire expression is a product, so each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the same as the coefficient in the first part multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from the second part, because when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient gets scaled by each term in the second expansion. Wait, but that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply together to give that specific term. But in this case, the first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\). So, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, multiplied by the entire second polynomial. Wait, no, because the second polynomial isn't a single term. So, actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). Therefore, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(15a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(20a^2b^2\\), \\(15a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), and \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only include the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, because that's the only term where the expression is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in this case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, as we found earlier. Now, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part with coefficient 6, and when multiplied by the term from the second part that has \\(c^0\\), which has coefficient 20. So, yes, multiplying these together gives 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Hmm, but wait, the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Does that mean the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, maybe when I multiply the two expressions together, the coefficients from each part multiply. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps we can treat the other part as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, but actually, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, so when you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only comes from the first part, and the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just 6 times whatever the entire second part is. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second part is being multiplied, so each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that means we're looking for the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and the constant term from the second part. Wait, is that right? Because if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second part, it would result in a term that includes \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part by the constant term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). How do I do that? I can use the binomial theorem again. Let me write that out. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(c\\) equal to \\(6 - 2m\\). The constant term is when the exponent is 0. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, does that make sense? Let me check. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. When we multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider how many ways we can get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. The only way is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term from the second part, which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I can consider the entire product as two separate expansions and look for the coefficient where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) sum to zero, so that the overall term is a pure \\(a^2b^2\\). But that approach might be more complicated. Alternatively, since the two parts are multiplied, the coefficients multiply as well, but only when the exponents of the variables match. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part and \\(c\\) is in the other, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by the constant term from the second part. So, that would indeed be 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems right. So, I think the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by multiplying the binomial coefficients from each part of the expression. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) to find the constant term. Using the binomial theorem, the constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which is at \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiply the two coefficients: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."
