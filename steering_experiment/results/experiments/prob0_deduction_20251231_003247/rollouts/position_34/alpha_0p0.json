Since these two terms are multiplied together in the product, the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives 20 for the constant term. Multiplying these together, 6 * 20 is indeed 120. So, the coefficient should be 120. Hmm, but just to be thorough, let me consider if there's another way this could be approached. Alternatively, I could think of the entire product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms in \\(c\\). So, when expanding the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part by every term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's sufficient to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) coefficient from the first part and multiply it by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, but that's not correct because the second part isn't a constant; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but none of these would contribute to the term \\(a^2b^2\\) alone because they all have additional \\(c\\) factors. Therefore, the only way to get a term that is exactly \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second polynomial, which is the \\(c^0\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.
