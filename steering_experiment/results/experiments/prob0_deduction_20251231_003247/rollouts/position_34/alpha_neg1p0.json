So, the entire expression is the product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When we multiply them, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the term that results in \\(a^2b^2\\), we have to find all possible products that result in \\(a^2b^2\\) times any term from the second expansion. But since the second expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), the only way the product can have no \\(c\\) term is if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second expansion. So, that's why we only need to consider the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion. So, 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nLet me just think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe by considering the entire expansion. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I were to expand this, each term would be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We are looking for the term where \\(a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\) is \\(a^2b^2\\), which happens when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as I found before. So, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).

So, when we multiply these two parts together, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will multiply the constant term 20 from the second part, giving \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). That seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Solving \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."
