    "text": " Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\), the coefficients from the two parts are multiplied together. That is, if I have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and any term from the second part, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by anything from the second expression will just be 6 times that coefficient. But wait, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, perhaps I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6, regardless of what happens with the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, that can't be right. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, no, that's not correct either. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first part, and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), so when you multiply them, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but each of those terms is a separate variable. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), we need to find the terms in the second expansion that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), result in a term that still has \\(a^2b^2\\). That is, we need the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that are constants, because only those will not introduce any \\(c\\) terms when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (i.e., the constant term) in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that using the binomial theorem as well. \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, which means \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120.

Now, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm not sure if this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but I think I need to consider how these two parts interact. Wait, actually, since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), maybe the second part can be treated separately. But actually, the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that means we're looking for the term in the expansion where the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to do that. Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. Let me write that expansion: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, actually, let me check that calculation again. 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720/(6*6) is 720/36, which is indeed 20. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, that's 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but hold on, is that correct? Because the two parts are multiplied together, so each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we're only considering the terms where the \\(c\\) parts cancel out, which is the \\(c^0\\) term. So, yes, I think that's right. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. The coefficient from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) for \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiplying them gives 6*20=120. Yeah, that seems correct.

    "text": " Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). Okay, so that part is clear. Now, the expression also has \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, but wait, the problem is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms? Or do I need to multiply the expansions together? Let me think. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. However, the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, if I'm looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to see how it's affected when multiplied by the other expression. Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all distinct. So, when you multiply, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some combination from the second expression. Wait, but actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would actually include all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, that doesn't seem right because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term without any \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That makes more sense because otherwise, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that's a sum of products from the second expansion. So, perhaps the problem is implicitly considering the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out, leaving a constant term. That would make sense. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second part, resulting in the term \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the overall coefficient would be the product of the two coefficients. Let me confirm that. So, the first coefficient is 6, as I found earlier. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, I need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which means \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the product of the two coefficients, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives a term \\(c^0\\) with coefficient 20. So, when you multiply these two, the term becomes \\(6 \\times 20 \\times a^2b^2c^0 = 120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 120. But wait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there a possibility that other terms from the second expansion could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by terms from the first expansion? For example, could a term with \\(c^1\\) from the second expansion multiply a term from the first expansion to give \\(a^2b^2c^1\\), but that would have \\(c^1\\), so it wouldn't contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) unless we're considering terms with \\(c^1\\) and \\(c^{-1}\\), but in that case, they wouldn't cancel out unless multiplied by each other. Wait, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms. So, I think that's only when the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, i.e., when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, I think my initial approach is correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me double-check the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), \\(m = 3\\), as I found earlier, so the coefficient is indeed 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, I guess I need to consider how this part affects the coefficient. But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). That means I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of the two expansions. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part, and \\(c\\) is in the other, the \\(c\\) terms won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms when we multiply them. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second part, when we multiply the two expressions, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would mean we need to consider the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because only then, when we multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), we get a term that doesn't have any \\(c\\) in it, so it's part of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we found to be 6. So, first, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, which means \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), \\(6 = 2k\\) so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6*6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we need to consider only the term in the second expansion that's a constant, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which we found to be 20. So, yes, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first polynomial and \\(c\\) is only in the second, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and the constant term from the second polynomial. So, that would indeed be 6 * 20 = 120. Let me check if that makes sense.

    "text": " Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. But wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so does that mean I need to consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as well? Let me think. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The other part of the expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that part of the expression doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Wait, is that right? Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), any term involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) won't affect the exponent of \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the term with \\(a^2b^2\\), the other part can be considered as a constant multiplier. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find the term in the product where the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, but since we're only considering \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the coefficient is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right either. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) would have to multiply terms in \\((a + b)^4\\) such that the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, that seems confusing. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try a different approach. The expression is a product of two independent binomial expansions: one in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). But does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384? Wait, no, that can't be right because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) should only be 6, regardless of the other terms, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing coefficients. Let me clarify. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\), the rest of the terms in the product would involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which aren't part of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient remains just 6, and the other part doesn't affect it. Wait, that seems more plausible. Because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but none of these would be just \\(a^2b^2\\) because they all have \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that \\(c\\) terms must somehow cancel out. But in reality, \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are variables, so unless there's a term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that is a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), the product won't have a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, perhaps the coefficient is zero because there's no constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) to pair with \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient, so maybe it's possible. Let me check. Let's expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the term where \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which would give us a constant term. Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) \u21d2 \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). Therefore, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) includes a constant term of 20. So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by this expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by the constant term 20 from the other expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 120. Let me double-check that. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when you multiply the two, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) evaluated at the same term. Wait, but actually, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from the terms involving \\(c\\). So, when we multiply the two expansions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is just a part of the product, but the entire product will have terms with various powers of \\(c\\). However, the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, that's not quite right. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire expression, which is a product of two expressions. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes to a different term in the product, but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives a term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) with some power of \\(c\\). But wait, no, that's not quite right either because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually 6 times the sum of the coefficients of each term in the second expansion. But the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\). Let me check that. So, the second expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I set \\(c = 1\\), then it becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me verify that. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, as I found earlier. So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me think again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Another approach: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I calculated. The expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. Let me write that out: \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) for \\(m\\) from 0 to 6. Now, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion. Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), as I thought before. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then I would have to find the corresponding term in the second expansion and multiply it by 6. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but actually, I think I might have misread the problem. Let me check again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, which includes terms with \\(c\\) as well. So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is not just 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion has a different power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, when considering the entire product, each term in the product will be a combination of terms from both expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all terms where the product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion results in \\(a^2b^2\\). But since the second expansion only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are separate variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will actually have coefficients from the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of the two polynomials, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients from the second part, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each contributing their own coefficients. So, yeah, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

But wait, the expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient. Hmm, so maybe the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by some term from the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that part of the expression involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) might not affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).

But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). That means I'm looking for the terms where, after multiplying, the \\(c\\) terms cancel out or perhaps are raised to a power that doesn't affect the presence of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of the products of the coefficients from the first part and the coefficients from the second part, but only for the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) result in a constant term, because otherwise, the term would involve \\(c\\) raised to some power, which isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because that's the only term that won't involve \\(c\\), and thus, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, first, I'll find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand this using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by 20, resulting in \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there any other term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that could contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Well, no, because any term with a non-zero exponent of \\(c\\) would result in a term that includes \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the constant term from the second part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120.

    "text": " Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). Okay, so that part is clear. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the whole expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, so does that mean that the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. Since we're multiplying two expressions, \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we need to find the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term, it will remain \\(a^2b^2\\), and any other term involving \\(c\\) would change the term, making it \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something like that, which isn't what we want. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me use the binomial theorem again on this part. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, it becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\) which means \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is the term when \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, actually, let me compute that again because 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720 divided by (6 \u00d7 6) is 720 / 36, which is 20. Yes, that's correct. So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when we multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by 20 from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes here. Let me go through it again. First, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each part where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out to zero.

That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that can't be right because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem correct because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is a constant with respect to the second part. So, when we multiply, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, that might not be the case because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a separate term, so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those terms, you're actually creating terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean we're only considering the terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so that \\(c^0\\), which is 1? Because otherwise, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), making it a different term. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by 6. That makes sense because when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you want the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, so that the overall term is just \\(a^2b^2\\) times a constant. So, let me try that approach.\n\nFirst, I'll compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To do that, I can again use the binomial theorem. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the exponent to be zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Since these two terms are multiplied together in the product, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20. When you multiply these two together, the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are multiplied by 1 (since \\(c^0 = 1\\)), so the resulting term is \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2 = 120 a^2b^2\\). That seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions. So, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is present only in the first polynomial and we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we only need the constant term from the second polynomial. So, yeah, 6 times 20 is 120. \n\nWait, but just to make sure I'm not missing anything, let me consider the entire expansion. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) as 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, and then it's multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which includes terms like c\u2076, c\u2074, c\u00b2, 1, c\u207b\u00b2, c\u207b\u2074, c\u207b\u2076. So, when we multiply 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 by each of these, we get terms like 6a\u00b2b\u00b2c\u2076, 6a\u00b2b\u00b2c\u2074, etc. However, the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That would only include the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 multiplied by the constant term 20, giving 120a\u00b2b\u00b2. All other terms would have some power of \\(c\\), so they wouldn't be pure \\(a^2b^2\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: When you have two expressions multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. In this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expression and multiply it by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second expression. So, that's 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, we know that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is given by:\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, each term in the expansion is:\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\frac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe set the exponent of \\(c\\) to zero to find the term:\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\nThe coefficient for this term is:\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{3} = \\frac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nFinally, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but this part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Wait a second, so the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), right? So, does that mean that the entire expression is the product of the two expansions? So, \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply these two expressions together, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that term is only affected by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part, and then multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that means I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, so that when multiplied, there's no \\(c\\) term, right? Wait, no, because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, actually, the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will have terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient, which would be a numerical value, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the entire expression is considered as a product, and we are looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, when we multiply out the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by every term from the second part, each contributing a coefficient. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, that seems more plausible. So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6, and the rest is multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). But wait, that seems too straightforward, and the problem is from an algebra context, so maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, in that case, I need to consider the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second part. So, that would mean I have to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, the overall coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion.\n\nSo, let me check that approach. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply those two coefficients together to get the final coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is what we're looking for.\n\nOkay, so let's compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me make sure I'm interpreting the problem correctly. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^i b^j c^k\\), where \\(i + j = 4\\) and \\(k\\) is some integer from the expansion of the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would correspond to \\(i = 2\\), \\(j = 2\\), and \\(k = 0\\), because \\(c^0\\) is the only term where \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't multiplied by a \\(c\\) term. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had been asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^m\\) for some \\(m\\), then the approach would be different, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's safe to assume that it's \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), so the coefficient is 120.\n\nLet me just go through the steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when the exponent is 0, which occurs at \\(k = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying those together, 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the coefficient should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results**:\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each expansion:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, when I multiply the two expansions together, the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) won't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part multiplied by the entire second part. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since the second polynomial doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in the first part won't be affected by the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the same as in the first part, right? Because when you multiply by the second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), it's like multiplying each term in the first expansion by a sum of terms in \\(c\\). So, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion. Wait, that seems confusing. Let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, say \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\), then the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the entire polynomial \\(Q(c)\\). But that doesn't make sense because \\(Q(c)\\) is a separate variable. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Since \\(c\\) is a separate variable, the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't interact with the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms remain as they are, and the \\(c\\) terms get multiplied by each term in the expansion. So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not correct because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of those would be separate terms in the product. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. I must be misunderstanding something. Let me think differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term will be of the form \\(a^k b^{4 - k} c^m\\) or \\(a^k b^{4 - k} c^{-m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all terms where \\(k = 2\\) and \\(4 - k = 2\\), which is just one term, multiplied by all the terms from the second expansion. Wait, no, because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^m\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-m}\\), but if you're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's actually the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, that can't be right because the coefficient should be a single number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make more sense because then the coefficient would be a number. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion, which would be a polynomial. That doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a scalar. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. Therefore, I need to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, then multiply them together. That sounds correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). I need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so I set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), \\(6 = 2k\\) so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is the product of the two coefficients: 6 (from the first part) times 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recap: To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that the product includes terms with \\(c\\), but since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which might imply that we're considering the coefficient regardless of the power of \\(c\\). However, in polynomial terms, the coefficient of a monomial is a scalar, so if \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), those would be different terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be zero unless we're considering \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, perhaps the problem is implicitly asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120.

    "text": " Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, that's 6. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the product of these two expansions. Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to consider the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so any terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) would still have \\(a^2b^2\\) but with different powers of \\(c\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think we can treat the two parts separately. Wait, no, actually, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then I need to consider all possible ways that multiplying terms from \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can give me \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so when multiplied by terms from the second expression, which involve \\(c\\), the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear is if it's multiplied by a term that is \\(c^0\\), because \\(c^0 = 1\\), so it doesn't affect the variables. So, in other words, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply those two terms together, you get \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1 = a^2b^2\\). So, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) has a coefficient of 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient of 20. When you multiply these two terms together, their coefficients multiply as well, so 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120. Wait, let me just double-check that I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 because \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. So, yes, that seems correct. I think I'm confident that 120 is the right answer.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\).

The entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient I just found. Wait, but the problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not involving \\(c\\).

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients can combine. But in this case, the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\), so when you multiply, the terms involving \\(c\\) would multiply with the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, because \\(c^0\\) is 1, and that would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term without changing it. Let me check that. So, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand this using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 because that's the term that will act as a scalar multiplier when we multiply by the first expansion. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\): \\(6 = 2m\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20.

Is there a possibility that other terms in the second expansion could contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term when multiplied by other terms in the first expansion? But no, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first expansion, and \\(c\\) is only in the second.

Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all, the coefficient would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should just be a number, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, no, that's not quite right either. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you multiply out the entire expression, you'll have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from each of these terms. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, that seems more accurate. Let me check that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all those coefficients. So, first, let me find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I found earlier. Now, I need to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part adds a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be combined with any power of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), I think the approach is correct. So, I think the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm interpreting the problem correctly. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, in the entire expansion, \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, yes, that would be the coefficient in the first part multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this differently. Let me consider the entire product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(k = 2\\), as before, which gives \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\). Now, this term is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). \n\nBut wait, \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\) is equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\), as I calculated earlier. So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\), which confirms my earlier result. \n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the entire expression is a product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, I'm confident that the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these results gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the terms from the second expression can be anything because when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they will contribute to different terms in the final expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that might be the case. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms that multiply with \\(a^2b^2\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), maybe we just need the coefficient from the first part, and the second part contributes a factor that is the sum of all its coefficients. Wait, no, because when you multiply, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part. Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient times \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would be the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but actually, no, because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\). So, when you expand the entire product, each term will be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\((c + 1/c)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\). Because each term in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), it's like adding up all those coefficients as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). So, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we found earlier to be 6. Now, we need to find the sum of the coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\). How do we find the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial? Well, one way is to substitute \\(c = 1\\), because then each term becomes just its coefficient. So, let's compute \\((1 + 1/1)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and when multiplied by each term in the second expansion, it's like \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Since the sum of the coefficients is 64, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems correct. Let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I can approach it differently. Let's consider that \\((c + 1/c)^6\\) expands to a sum of terms, each of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term has a coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) and a power of \\(c\\) as \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\). Now, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{m} a^{4 - m}b^m \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(m = 2\\) in the first expansion, and any \\(k\\) in the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). Wait, that's the same as before. Because \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\), so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, if I didn't remember that the sum of coefficients is 2^n, I could compute it as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. But wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider that as well. Hmm, so the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the variables involved in the first part are \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), they are independent of each other. That means when I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms at all because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) because the other part doesn't contribute any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient is 6. Wait, but let me double-check that. So, the expression is a product of two independent expansions. So, when you multiply them, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\), any term from the second expansion that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) will just multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply the two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes only from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, they don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I'm only concerned with the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), etc., but none of these will affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient isn't just 6, it's 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, if I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right either because the problem might just be asking for the coefficient in the entire product, considering all possible \\(c\\) terms. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that seems a bit strange. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's 6 multiplied by whatever comes from the \\(c\\) part, but since the \\(c\\) part is separate, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6. Hmm, I'm getting confused here. Let me try another approach. Let's consider the entire expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, as I found earlier. Now, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is another binomial expansion, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that's not correct because the coefficients in the second expansion are not all the same. Each term in the second expansion has its own coefficient. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in a binomial expansion \\((x + y)^n\\) is found by setting \\(x = 1\\) and \\(y = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, that seems too high. Let me check that again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6, and the \\(c\\) terms are just part of the larger expression but don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. So, maybe the answer is just 6. Hmm, I'm not sure. Let me think of it another way. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15\\dfrac{1}{c^2} + 6\\dfrac{1}{c^4} + \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\right)\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each of these coefficients, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is indeed \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Wait, but that seems like a lot. Let me confirm by computing the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, yes, 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384. But wait, the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", not considering any specific power of \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, resulting in multiple terms with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as a standalone term (without considering \\(c\\)) would indeed be the sum of all those coefficients, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for a specific \\(k\\), then it would be different. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient is 384. Therefore, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the entire expression:**\n   The given expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When multiplying two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider how many times the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by terms from the second expansion.\n\n3. **Sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of all coefficients in a binomial expansion \\((x + y)^n\\) is found by setting \\(x = 1\\) and \\(y = 1\\). Therefore, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is:\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

So, I need to consider the expansion of this part as well. But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) because they will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the terms from the second part will just scale the coefficient, but not affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, I think I can treat the second part as a constant multiplier when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but actually, no. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), we just need to find the coefficient from the first part, and then multiply it by the entire second expression, because any term from the second expression will just add more factors, but since we're only considering the coefficient, it will just scale the coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as the coefficient being the product of the coefficients from each part, but in this case, since the first part's coefficient is 6, and the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, the sum of all its coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\), so \\( (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). But wait, that might not be correct because we don't need the sum, but just the coefficient. Wait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so in the entire expression, which is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, and then when multiplied by the entire second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the term 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), that means the coefficient will be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but that would mean the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), so it's just 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the sum of coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is 2^6 = 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But that might not be what's intended.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so in the entire product, each term will be of the form (something with a\u00b2b\u00b2) multiplied by (something with c's). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of a\u00b2b\u00b2, regardless of the c terms, that means we can consider the coefficient as 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in c, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is being expanded, and we're looking for the term where a\u00b2b\u00b2 appears, regardless of the c terms. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought earlier. But let me check that again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be the term where c^0, which is the middle term. Let me calculate that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of c is zero, so 6 - 2k = 0 \u21d2 k = 3. So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". It doesn't specify any particular power of c, so perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in c, which seems odd because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where a\u00b2b\u00b2 is multiplied by c^0. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120, as I calculated earlier. Alternatively, if it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of c, then it would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I think the more likely scenario is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), so the term where a\u00b2b\u00b2 is multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various k. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any power of c, that would imply that we're considering all possible powers of c, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second polynomial, which would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in c. But that doesn't make sense because coefficients are usually constants. So, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where a\u00b2b\u00b2 is multiplied by c^0, which is the constant term. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the variables a and b only, so the c terms are irrelevant, and the coefficient is just 6, but that seems unlikely because the entire expression includes c terms.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to approach it differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the first polynomial is in a and b, and the second is in c. So, the terms in the product will be of the form (coefficient from first part) * (coefficient from second part) * a^2b^2c^k, where k can be any integer. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of a^2b^2, without specifying any power of c. So, that would imply that the coefficient is the sum of all coefficients from the second part multiplied by 6. Because each term in the second part will multiply the 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 term, resulting in 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of a\u00b2b\u00b2 in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting c = 1, so \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it might be 120, but that was under the assumption that we're looking for the constant term in c. So, which is it? Let me check the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any power of c, so it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of c. So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be 6 times each term in that expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in c. But that can't be right because the problem is expecting a numerical answer. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where a\u00b2b\u00b2 is multiplied by c^0. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120, as I calculated earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, which would be 6 * 20 = 120. Let me confirm that. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part with coefficient 6, and the constant term in the second part is 20, so when multiplied together, the term is 6 * 20 a\u00b2b\u00b2, so the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about it differently. Suppose I consider the entire expression as a product of two polynomials: one in a and b, and one in c. When you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. So, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the variables a, b, and c all in the same term, and the question is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. That makes more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial, which doesn't seem right for this problem.\n\nWait, but let me check the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". So, it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of c. So, in the product, each term would be of the form (coefficient from first part) * (coefficient from second part) * a^2b^2c^k. So, the coefficient of a\u00b2b\u00b2 would be the sum over all k of (coefficient from first part) * (coefficient from second part). But the coefficient from the first part is 6, and the coefficients from the second part are the coefficients of c^k in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of a\u00b2b\u00b2 in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that would mean that the coefficient is 384, which is a numerical value. So, perhaps that's the answer. Let me think again. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by substituting c = 1, which gives 2^6 = 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of a\u00b2b\u00b2 is 384.\n\nBut earlier, I thought it might be 120, but that was under the assumption that we're looking for the constant term in c. But the problem doesn't specify that. It just asks for the coefficient of a\u00b2b\u00b2, so I think the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me test this with a smaller example to see if this approach is correct. Suppose I have (a + b)^1 * (c + 1/c)^1. Then, the coefficient of a^1b^0 would be 1 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 2. So, the coefficient of a^1b^0 would be 2, which would mean that the term is 2a^1b^0c^0 + 2a^1b^0c^{-1}. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a constant, not a polynomial. So, perhaps my approach is wrong.\n\nWait, no, in reality, when you have two separate variables, the coefficients are treated separately. So, in the product, each term is a product of terms from each polynomial. So, the coefficient of a^1b^0 would be 1 times the entire second polynomial, which is c + 1/c. So, the coefficient of a^1b^0 is c + 1/c, which is a polynomial. But that seems odd because usually, coefficients are constants. So, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of a^2b^2c^0, which would be a constant. Therefore, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think I need to clarify this. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so in the product, the term would be of the form (something) * a^2b^2. The \"something\" could include any power of c. But if we're only interested in the coefficient of a^2b^2, regardless of c, then the coefficient would be a polynomial in c. But if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's a constant. Since the problem doesn't specify, I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the variables a, b, and c all present in the term, so the coefficient is 120. Let me check that again. The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, and the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives a term with c^0, which is 20. So, when multiplied together, the term is 6 * 20 a\u00b2b\u00b2 = 120a\u00b2b\u00b2. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, so the coefficient I found, 6, is just from the first part. But the entire expression is a product of two binomial expansions. So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times something? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, when we multiply out the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second part, their coefficients won't be affected by the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6. \n\nWait, that seems too straightforward. Let me make sure I'm not missing something. The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which expands to terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, it will just add those variables multiplied by \\(c\\) terms. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms because they won't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). It's like, the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients from each part, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first part, and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient remains 6. \n\nWait, maybe another way to think about it: when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms that multiply together to give that specific term. But in this case, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only in the first part, and the second part doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, so the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and any term from the second part. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part's terms are in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expression. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because each term in the product would have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But that can't be right because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. \n\nWait, let me clarify: when you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms from each polynomial that multiply together to form that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first polynomial, and the second polynomial has only \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and any term from the second polynomial. But since the second polynomial's terms don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), they don't affect the exponent of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. But wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the product would have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and a term from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, that makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, each term contributes a coefficient, so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, 6 times 64 is indeed 384. \n\nLet me check this again. The first part gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second part, when \\(c = 1\\), gives 64. So, when you multiply, each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that each term in the product will be of the form \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from -6 to 6 in steps of 2, because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\), where \\(m\\) goes from 0 to 6. So, each term in the product would be \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by 6. Since the sum of coefficients is 64, as calculated before, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but actually, in the product, each term is \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, each multiplied by 6. So, yes, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to just consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the answer is 6. But that seems too simple, and I think the correct approach is to consider the entire product, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nWait, let me confirm this. Let me expand both parts separately. \n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. \n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nSo, the expansion will have terms like \\(c^6, 6c^4, 15c^2, 20, 15c^{-2}, 6c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\). \n\nNow, when we multiply the two expansions, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6, 6a^2b^2c^4, 6a^2b^2c^2, 6a^2b^2, 6a^2b^2c^{-2}, 6a^2b^2c^{-4}, 6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). \n\nBut the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself (without any \\(c\\) terms) comes from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20. So, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So, maybe I was wrong before. Because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but without considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, it's only the coefficient when the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term in the second expansion. \n\nSo, in the second expansion, the constant term is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, so I think I made a mistake earlier by considering the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, but actually, we're only interested in the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, and the problem is asking for \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, and then multiply that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion, which is 6, giving 120. \n\nLet me confirm this again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which has varying powers of \\(c\\). However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that we are only considering the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). But wait, no, actually, in the product, each term would have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents as well as \\(c\\) exponents. So, if we are looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would include all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the sum of the products of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) and each term in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But earlier, I thought that maybe the problem was only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem statement is ambiguous. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the context of polynomials, when you have multiple variables, the coefficient of a specific term like \\(a^2b^2\\) would include all terms where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, regardless of the other variables. So, in this case, the coefficient would be the sum of all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, each multiplied by their respective coefficients from the second expansion. \n\nSo, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, I'm now confused because earlier I thought it was 120, but now I'm thinking it's 384. Let me try to clarify. \n\nThe problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, when you multiply the two expressions, you'll have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of the coefficients of all these terms. So, each of these terms has a coefficient of 6 times the coefficient from the second expansion. \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6 * 1 = 6, because the coefficient of \\(c^6\\) in the second expansion is 1. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 6 * 6 = 36, because the coefficient of \\(c^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^2\\) is 6 * 15 = 90, since the coefficient of \\(c^2\\) is 15. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (with \\(c^0\\)) is 6 * 20 = 120. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\) is 6 * 15 = 90, and similarly for \\(c^{-4}\\) and \\(c^{-6}\\), which would be 36 and 6 respectively. \n\nSo, if we sum all these coefficients to get the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (regardless of the power of \\(c\\)), it would be 6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6. Let me calculate that: \n\n6 + 36 = 42; 42 + 90 = 132; 132 + 120 = 252; 252 + 90 = 342; 342 + 36 = 378; 378 + 6 = 384. \n\nSo, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought maybe the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. So, which is it? \n\nLooking back at the problem statement: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" \n\nIn the context of polynomials, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term, say \\(a^2b^2\\), it usually refers to the term where those variables have exactly those exponents, regardless of the other variables. So, in this case, since \\(c\\) is another variable, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the product multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, each multiplied by their respective \\(c\\) terms. \n\nBut wait, no, actually, in the product, each term is a product of terms from both expansions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, which includes different powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, another way to think about it: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms that multiply to give that term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first polynomial, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and any term from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but earlier when I considered the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), I got 120. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but the way it's written is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe the problem is intended to have \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which would be 120. \n\nI think I need to clarify this. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" \n\nIn the context of polynomials, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\), it usually refers to the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and any other variables are raised to the zero power. So, in this case, the term would be \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, that seems more accurate because if the problem had meant to include all powers of \\(c\\), it would have specified something like the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). So, I think the intended interpretation is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nLet me verify this by considering the product. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion, which is 20. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the correct answer is 120. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 384 when considering all terms. So, which one is correct? \n\nI think the confusion arises from whether the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384, or the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nGiven that the problem is written as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\), it's more likely that they're asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Because if they wanted the sum over all \\(c\\) terms, they would probably have specified that. \n\nSo, to confirm, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120. \n\nWait, but let me think again. When you have a product of two polynomials, each term in the product is a combination of terms from both polynomials. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. \n\nWait, that would mean the coefficient is 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second polynomial). The sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut that would imply that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384, which includes all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, each multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). \n\nSo, now I'm really confused. Which interpretation is correct? \n\nLet me try to find similar problems or think about how coefficients are usually handled. In polynomial multiplication, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term, it's usually the coefficient of that exact term, considering all variables. So, if you're asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's the coefficient when \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and all other variables are at their default, which is typically zero. So, in this case, that would be \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 120. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it would have meant the sum of coefficients where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared, irrespective of \\(c\\), which would be 384. \n\nBut since the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", I think it's referring to \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), so the answer is 120. \n\nWait, let me try another approach. Let's consider the entire expansion. \n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) to get the terms. As before, it's \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). \n\nNow, expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. As we saw earlier, the expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\). \n\nNow, when we multiply these two expansions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in \\(6a^2b^2c^6 + 6a^2b^2c^4 + 6a^2b^2c^2 + 6a^2b^2 + 6a^2b^2c^{-2} + 6a^2b^2c^{-4} + 6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). \n\nSo, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) appears in multiple terms, each with a different power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (without any restriction on \\(c\\)) would be the sum of all these coefficients, which is 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 = 42. Wait, that can't be right because each term's coefficient is 6 times the coefficient from the second expansion. \n\nWait, no, that's incorrect. Let me correct that. \n\nEach term in the product is \\(6a^2b^2 \\times\\) (each term from the second expansion). So, the coefficients are 6 * 1, 6 * 6, 6 * 15, 6 * 20, 6 * 15, 6 * 6, 6 * 1. \n\nSo, the coefficients are 6, 36, 90, 120, 90, 36, 6. \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6, \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 36, \\(a^2b^2c^2\\) is 90, \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120, \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\) is 90, \\(a^2b^2c^{-4}\\) is 36, and \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\) is 6. \n\nSo, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's the sum of all these coefficients, which is 6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6 = 384. \n\nBut if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\), then it's 120. \n\nGiven that the problem is written as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without any mention of \\(c\\), it's more likely that they're asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nAlternatively, if they wanted the sum over all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of \\(c\\), they would have specified something like \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all powers of \\(c\\)\". \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 120. \n\nWait, but let me check this with another approach. \n\nLet me consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nIf I set \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), \\(c = 1\\), then the entire expression becomes \\((1 + 1)^4 \\times (1 + 1)^6 = 16 \\times 64 = 1024\\). \n\nNow, if I set \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), but leave \\(c\\) as is, then the expression becomes \\((2)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = 16 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nIf I want to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the same as the coefficient of \\(1^2 \\times 1^2 = 1\\), in the expression, it's equivalent to finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 16. \n\nWait, but in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as the constant term in the second expansion, because when \\(a = 1\\) and \\(b = 1\\), \\(a^2b^2 = 1\\). So, the value of the expression when \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), and \\(c = 1\\) is 16 * 64 = 1024, which is the sum of all coefficients. \n\nBut if I set \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), and \\(c = 1\\), I get the sum of all coefficients, which is 1024. But I need only the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to isolate that, perhaps I can use a different substitution. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps using generating functions or considering the multinomial coefficients. But I think this approach is getting too complicated. \n\nI think the key is to recognize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expansion. So, that would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nTherefore, after all this thinking, I believe the correct answer is 120. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\binom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0), which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), i.e., \\(m = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\binom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the expansion is 20.\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6.\n\nNow, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term comes only from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), right? Because the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients from each part? Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again.\n\nWait, actually, the entire expression is a product of two expansions: one in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when we multiply them together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we need to find the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that contribute to the constant term (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero). Because when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a constant term from the second expansion, it will just contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the overall product.\n\nWait, so actually, I think I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), it remains \\(a^2b^2\\), and we don't want any \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, first, I already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6*6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of 6 and 20, which is 6*20=120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6, correct. Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(m=3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}=20\\). So, when we multiply these together, 6*20=120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but just to double-check, maybe I should consider if there are any other terms that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). But no, because the other expansion only contributes constants or terms with \\(c\\), which aren't part of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think I'm confident that 120 is the correct coefficient.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by multiplying the coefficient from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)**: Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**: The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs when \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. **Multiply the coefficients**: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer**: The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."
