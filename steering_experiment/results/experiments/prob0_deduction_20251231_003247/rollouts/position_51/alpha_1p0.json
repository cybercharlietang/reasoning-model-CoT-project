So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me consider the entire expression. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\), it must be multiplied by the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\). Because if it's multiplied by any other term, like \\(c^1\\) or \\(c^{-1}\\), the resulting term would have \\(c^1\\) or \\(c^{-1}\\), which we don't want. So, only the term with \\(c^0\\) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed the product of the two coefficients: 6 and 20, which is 120. So, I think that's correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that the entire expression is a product of two independent binomial expansions. Therefore, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expansion. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion has coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion has coefficient 20. Multiplying them gives 120, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, I think that's solid.\n\nWait, just to make sure, maybe I should consider if there's any other term that could contribute. For example, is there a possibility that when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by some \\(c\\) term, it could somehow result in a term without \\(c\\)? But no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are all in terms of \\(c\\). So, unless the second term is \\(c^0\\), the product will have a \\(c\\) term. Therefore, only the \\(c^0\\) term contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term without any \\(c\\). So, yes, the coefficient is 120.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it another way. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that makes sense. I think I'm confident with that answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n\\[\n\\text{Coefficient of } a^2b^2 = \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\):\n\\[\n\\text{Coefficient of } c^0 = \\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."
