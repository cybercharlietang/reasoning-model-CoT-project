So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, because when you multiply the two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplies each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the term where the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts are \\(a^2b^2\\) and the \\(c\\) part is \\(c^0\\), the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, is that correct?

Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).

So, yes, the coefficient is 120.

Simplifying the exponents: \\(c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).

Now, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we take the product of the coefficients we found. That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives a constant term (c^0) with coefficient 20. When you multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, including the constant term 20. But wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion that don't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). But in this case, the only term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is the constant term, which is 20. So, yes, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that when you multiply the two polynomials, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part and the constant term in the second part, because any other term in the second part would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would make the term have \\(c\\) in it, which we don't want. So, yes, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, just to make sure I'm not making a mistake, let me consider an alternative approach. Suppose I expand both parts and multiply them. The first part is \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's compute the second part's expansion. Using the binomial theorem, as I did before, it's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the terms are:\n\n- m=0: \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1 * c^6\\)\n- m=1: \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^{4} = 6c^4\\)\n- m=2: \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^{2} = 15c^2\\)\n- m=3: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\)\n- m=4: \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- m=5: \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- m=6: \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply this by \\((a + b)^4\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a^2b^2. When I multiply this by each term in the second expansion, I get:\n\n6a^2b^2 * c^6 + 6a^2b^2 * 6c^4 + 6a^2b^2 * 15c^2 + 6a^2b^2 * 20 + 6a^2b^2 * 15c^{-2} + 6a^2b^2 * 6c^{-4} + 6a^2b^2 * c^{-6}.\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) terms. So, in the product, the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is the term where we multiply 6a^2b^2 by 20, because that's the constant term. All the other terms would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, so they wouldn't be part of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. That confirms my earlier result.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there a possibility that another term from \\((a + b)^4\\) could combine with a term from the second expansion to give \\(a^2b^2\\)? For example, could \\(a^3b\\) from the first expansion multiply with a term involving \\(c^{-1}\\) from the second expansion, and somehow result in \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, no, because when you multiply \\(a^3b\\) by \\(c^{-1}\\), you still have \\(a^3b\\), which doesn't become \\(a^2b^2\\). Similarly, other terms would either increase or decrease the exponents, but they can't change the exponents in such a way to produce \\(a^2b^2\\) unless they're already \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion, when multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, will give a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and no \\(c\\) terms. So, yes, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that when you have two independent variables, the coefficients multiply when you take the product of their expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the other expansion is 20, so their product is 120. So, that's consistent.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me consider an example with smaller exponents to see if the approach is correct. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). Expanding \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\). Now, the product would be \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). If I look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but wait, in this case, there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term because the first expansion only goes up to \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\), but when multiplied by \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), you can't get \\(a^2b^2\\) because that would require multiplying \\(a^2\\) by \\(b^2\\), which isn't possible in this setup. Hmm, maybe that's not the best example. Let me try with \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). Then, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). Now, the product is \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2)\\). If I look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in this product, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by multiplying \\(a^2\\) by \\(b^2\\), but in the first expansion, \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) are separate terms. Wait, actually, no, because in the product, each term is a product of a term from the first polynomial and a term from the second. So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), you would need to have \\(a^2\\) multiplied by \\(b^2\\), but in the first polynomial, \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) are separate. Wait, but in reality, the first polynomial is \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). So, the term \\(2ab\\) is present, but \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't. So, in this case, there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product because you can't get \\(a^2b^2\\) by multiplying any two terms from the two polynomials. Wait, but if I have \\((a + b)^3 \\times (c + 1/c)^3\\), then \\((a + b)^3\\) has a term \\(3a^2b\\), and \\((c + 1/c)^3\\) has a constant term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because you can't get \\(a^2b^2\\) from the product. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this, but in the original problem, the first expansion has \\(a^2b^2\\) as a term, and the second expansion has a constant term, so their product gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6 * 20 = 120. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, another thought: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. So, in this case, for the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to find all pairs of terms from each polynomial that multiply to give \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). In the first polynomial, the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and in the second polynomial, the term is \\(20c^0\\). So, when you multiply these, you get \\(6 * 20 a^2b^2c^0 = 120a^2b^2\\). There are no other terms in the first polynomial that have \\(a^2b^2\\), and in the second polynomial, there are no other terms with \\(c^0\\) except the constant term. So, yes, the coefficient is 120.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I can't see any mistakes in this reasoning, so I'm confident the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 20.\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each expansion:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Let me tackle the second part. To find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can again use the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\cdot c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which means \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(6 = 2m\\) so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, since the two polynomials are multiplied together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will come from multiplying the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and the constant term from the second polynomial.

I think that makes sense. Alternatively, I could think of the entire product as a product of two polynomials, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be formed by taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and the constant term from the second part. Any other combination would introduce \\(c\\) terms, which we don't want. So, yeah, 120 should be the correct coefficient.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem**:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem**:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both expansions**:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer**: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."
