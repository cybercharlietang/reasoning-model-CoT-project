That seems right. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. But since the first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\), the only way to get a term that's purely \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first by the \\(c^0\\) term from the second. Any other term from the second polynomial would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would make the term have \\(c\\) in it, so we don't care about those. So, yes, it's just 6 * 20 = 120.

Alternatively, I could consider that the entire expression is the product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\).
