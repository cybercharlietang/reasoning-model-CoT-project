So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in identifying which term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives the constant term. So, the general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We set the exponent equal to 0: 6 - 2m = 0 => m = 3. So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\\). That's correct. So, no mistake there.\n\nAnother way to think about it: when you have \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term occurs when the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel each other out. So, for each term, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - m\\) and the exponent of \\(1/c\\) is \\(m\\), so total exponent is \\(6 - 2m\\). Setting that to zero gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is indeed \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's correct.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me consider if there's any other term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\((a + b)^4\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), any term in the second polynomial that has \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) would result in a term with \\(c\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), which is not what we want. So, only the constant term (m=3) in the second polynomial contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the final answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Setting \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " That's correct. Then, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\): 6! / (3! * 3!) = 720 / (6 * 6) = 720 / 36 = 20. That's correct too. So, 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) has terms up to \\(a^4\\) and \\(b^4\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\). But when we multiply them, the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) is to multiply the constant term from the second polynomial with the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first. So, that's the only contribution, which gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 20.\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both parts:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."
