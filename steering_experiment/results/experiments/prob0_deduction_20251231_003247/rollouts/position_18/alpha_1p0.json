    "text": " So, maybe the coefficient is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is for the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second. So, if I'm only interested in the terms where the result has \\(a^2b^2\\), then I can take the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) which is 6 and multiply it by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if I take any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it will have some power of \\(c\\), but since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way that term would appear in the product is if the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, i.e., when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to do that. Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(6 = 2m\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 20.

First, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs at \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).

To find the constant term, I can again use the binomial theorem. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second. But since the second expression is in terms of \\(c\\), which is separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't seem right because the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanding this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can consider that term separately. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, as I found earlier. Now, when we multiply this term by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product equal to 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. But actually, no, because when you multiply, each term is independent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually 6 multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe we need to consider that the coefficient is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term we're interested in. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the middle term, which occurs when the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) balance out to zero. So, let me calculate that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part with coefficient 6, and when we multiply it by each term in the second expansion, the only term that doesn't introduce any \\(c\\) terms is when we multiply by \\(c^0\\), which has a coefficient of 20. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that since the two parts are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, 6 times 20 is 120. I think that's correct. Let me check with a small example to make sure. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in \\((a + b)^2\\) is 1, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\) is 0 because there's no \\(c^0\\) term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the product would be 1 times 0, which is 0. Alternatively, expanding it out: \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c) = a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). There's no \\(a^2b^0\\) term, which matches the calculation. So, my approach seems correct. Therefore, in the original problem, the coefficient should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " So, when I expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), that would be another binomial expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part, I might not need to multiply it by anything from the second part. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is the product of the two expansions. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding something. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand both, I get terms from both expansions multiplied together. But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first expansion, right? Because the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by every term from the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe I'm supposed to consider the entire coefficient, including the contribution from the second expansion? Wait, no. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first expansion, and when multiplied by the second expansion, it would produce terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that the coefficient is just the coefficient from the first expansion, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion, which is a sum of terms in \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire second expansion, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. Perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That would make sense because then we're considering a specific term in the product. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, and then multiply them together. So, let me check that approach. First, in \\((a + b)^4\\), as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\). That would be the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. Let me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem: \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want this exponent to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Now, since the original expression is the product of the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) will be the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and the \\(c^0\\) term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but I just realized that when I multiply the two expansions, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, including the \\(c^0\\) term.

Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include all possible \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term with \\(c\\) raised to some power.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion, but that doesn't give a numerical value. So, perhaps the intended interpretation is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120, as I calculated earlier. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, but then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but that's not a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.

Wait, no, that might not be correct. Wait, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But in this case, the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will only come from the first part, and the terms involving \\(c\\) will come from the second part.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider whether the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be combined with any terms from the second part. But \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you'll end up with terms that have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Therefore, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) appears without any \\(c\\) terms is if it's multiplied by 1, which would be the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, first, I found that the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me use the binomial theorem again for that. \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m\\).

We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. When you multiply these two, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by the constant term from the second part, resulting in \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient is 120. I think that makes sense. Alternatively, maybe I should think about the entire expansion. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanded, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), we have \\(k = 2\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, to have the term \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, we need \\(c^0\\), which occurs when \\(m = 3\\), as we found earlier, giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, does that mean I'm considering the product of both expansions, and the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear is when it's multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion? Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any other term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), it would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so those terms would not contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the only contribution is from the constant term in the second expansion. So, 6 times 20 is 120. I think that's correct.

    "text": " So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the same as the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) because the other part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, but is that correct? Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by another expression, say \\(X\\), then when I expand it, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(X\\). But since I'm only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, which is in \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by any term in \\(X\\), it would still be \\(a^2b^2\\) times that term. But the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all terms in \\(X\\), but wait, that's not quite right. Wait, no, because \\(X\\) is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term in \\(X\\) would contribute to a different term in the final expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, in the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(X\\), meaning that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(X\\). Wait, that makes sense because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), so its coefficient is 6, and then it's multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems a bit high. Let me check my reasoning again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is a scalar, 6, and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it becomes 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think differently. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, because otherwise, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have some power of \\(c\\). But the problem didn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, yes, the coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be different because then we'd have to find the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on \\(c\\), the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the other polynomial, which is 64, so 6*64=384. So, I think that's the answer. But let me just verify with another approach.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found. Then, when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64=384. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but another thought: maybe the problem is intended to have the entire term, including the \\(c\\) terms, but only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) part. So, in that case, yes, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the other polynomial, which is 64, so 384. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, because the middle term in that expansion is the constant term, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6*20=120. But since the problem didn't specify any \\(c\\) terms, just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me think of it as two separate parts. The expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a^2b^2, and when you multiply this by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you get 6a^2b^2 times each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but another way to see it: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, from \\((a + b)^4\\), it's 6, and from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient is the sum of all coefficients, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of it as two separate expansions. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has 64 as the sum of its coefficients, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of the entire product as a single expansion, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the other part, which is 64, so 384.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me calculate \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of its coefficients is when \\(c=1\\), which is 2^6=64, as I thought. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm with another approach. Suppose I consider the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of coefficients from the other polynomial, because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm making a mistake here. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first polynomial, so when you multiply, it's like 6a^2b^2 times each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to expand the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in each term of the expansion, multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 384.\n\nWait, but maybe I should think about it differently. Let me consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in each part. But since the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), its coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 1, but actually, no, because the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), so when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients from the second part. So, that's 6 times 64=384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The key is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is determined only by the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by the entire second part, each term in the second part adds to the coefficient. So, the total coefficient is 6 times 64=384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then yes, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64. So, 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then I would have to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}=20\\), and then multiply by 6, giving 120. But since the problem didn't specify any \\(c\\) terms, I think it's 384.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Let me compute \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is when \\(c=1\\), which is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6=64\\), correct. So, the sum of all coefficients is 64, so when I multiply by 6, it's 384.\n\nTherefore, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me try a small example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 2 times (1 + 1) = 4? Wait, no, because in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present because the first part is only squared. Wait, perhaps a better example: \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present because the first part only goes up to \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\), but the product would have terms like \\(a^2c\\), \\(a^2/c\\), etc., but not \\(a^2b^2\\) because the first part is \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), so when multiplied by \\((c + 1/c)\\), the term \\(2ab\\) would give \\(2abc + 2ab/c\\), and the term \\(a^2\\) would give \\(a^2c + a^2/c\\), and similarly for \\(b^2\\). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because it's not present. So, perhaps my initial approach is wrong because in the original problem, the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) doesn't have any \\(a^2b^2\\) terms unless they come from both parts. Wait, but that contradicts my earlier reasoning. Wait, no, because in the original problem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), it's like \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) exists in the product, and its coefficient is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the other part. So, in the small example, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present in the product. Wait, but in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero, which contradicts my earlier approach. So, perhaps my approach is wrong. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the terms. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) exists in \\((a + b)^4\\), but when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 384. But in the small example, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't exist because the first part is only up to \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\), but when multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), you get terms like \\(a^2c\\), \\(a^2/c\\), \\(2abc\\), \\(2ab/c\\), \\(b^2c\\), \\(b^2/c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero, which suggests that my approach is incorrect. So, perhaps my initial reasoning is wrong, and I need to think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises because in the small example, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present because it's a product of two separate variables, so their exponents don't combine in a way that creates \\(a^2b^2\\). But in the original problem, \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it's present in the product as \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 384. But in the small example, since the first part is only squared, \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present because you need at least \\(a^2b^2\\) to have that term, but in \\((a + b)^2\\), the highest term is \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps in the original problem, since \\((a + b)^4\\) does have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, when multiplied by the other part, it does contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, maybe my initial approach is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is that in the small example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present because it's not formed by the product, but in the original problem, it is present because \\((a + b)^4\\) has an \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the other part, which is 64, so 384.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first polynomial, so when you multiply, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 384.\n\nWait, but let me try another small example to confirm. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion is \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present because the first part is only to the first power. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero, which aligns with the idea that if the first part doesn't have the term, the product won't either. But in our original problem, the first part does have \\(a^2b^2\\), so the product will have that term multiplied by each term in the second part, leading to the coefficient being 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me consider \\((a + b)^3 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion of \\((a + b)^3\\) is \\(a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3\\). When multiplied by \\((c + 1/c)\\), the term \\(a^2b\\) would be present, but \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't in the first part, so the product won't have \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero. But in our original problem, since the first part has \\(a^2b^2\\), the product will have that term multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient is 6*64=384.\n\nTherefore, after all this thinking, I believe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem and properties of polynomial multiplication.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

So, maybe the coefficient is just 6? Wait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility that when I multiply the two expansions, some terms might combine in a way that affects the \\(a^2b^2\\) term? Hmm, no, because the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part is being multiplied as a whole.

But since we're only looking for terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) parts can be anything, but they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Alternatively, maybe I should consider that each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) is only one term, and the rest of the terms involve \\(c\\), so the coefficient would just be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient, so it's 6 times the sum of coefficients, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. Wait, but let me check with a different approach. Alternatively, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the product of two separate expansions, and since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the other part. So, yes, I think 384 is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we're looking for the coefficient when \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because any other term involving \\(c\\) would result in a term that includes \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to find the coefficient, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by 6 (the coefficient from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\)).\n\nOkay, so let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).

Multiplying these together gives 120. That seems right. I don't think I missed anything here. The key was recognizing that since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, we don't need to consider any \\(c\\) terms other than the constant term.

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and any term from the second part, it would create a term like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k \\times (1/c)^{6 - k}\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part.

Now, how do I find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Well, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables.

So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems a bit high. Let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in considering that the entire expansion of the second part is multiplied by the first part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) part at all. Wait, no, because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second. So, \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). But the question is just about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that means that each time \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a term from the second expansion, it contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of \\(c\\)'s power. Therefore, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting a different approach. Perhaps it's only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of \\(c\\). But in that case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the product as \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me see. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial, but only when the exponents add up appropriately. Wait, but in this case, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), so the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with those of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be paired with any term from the second expansion, and each such pairing would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's equivalent to taking the coefficient from the first part and multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, and we're summing all those contributions. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then I would have to find the specific coefficient in the second expansion where the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(k\\), and then multiply by 6. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. So, I think that's the answer. Let me just check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 1. Expanded \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem and found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. 2. Recognized that the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms with various powers of \\(c\\). 3. Since the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), I considered that each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. 4. Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. 5. The sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by substituting \\(c=1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). 6. So, 6*64=384. That seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes here.

But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms at all. Wait, no, that's not right. Because when you multiply two expressions together, the coefficients multiply as well. But in this case, since I'm looking for the coefficient of a specific term in the product, which is \\(a^2b^2\\), that term would come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part and the constant term (if any) in the second part. Wait, but \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't have a constant term unless there's a term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. Let me check that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, I'm looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that would be the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by 20 from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when I multiply these two parts, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be 6 * 20 * \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient is 120. That makes sense. I don't think I made any mistakes here. Let me just go through it again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) includes a constant term when the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, which happens when \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, yes, the coefficient is 120.

But since we're only interested in terms that result in \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the \\(c\\) part can be considered separately. Wait, no, actually, the \\(c\\) part is multiplied by every term in \\((a + b)^4\\), but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) would just be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But that seems too broad because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, and since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only present in the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which seems incorrect because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is actually looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, not a polynomial. Maybe I'm missing something. Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible terms, including those involving \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), so the coefficient would just be 6 multiplied by whatever the coefficient is for \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), but if you're only interested in the term \\(a^2b^2\\), that would require \\(c^0\\), meaning the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6. Let me try that approach. First, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me check that again. Because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1, then the coefficient is indeed 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), giving 120. So, I think that's the correct coefficient.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " So, maybe the coefficient is just 6, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, because the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

However, since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that is, the coefficient in the entire product, but only considering \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but actually, in the product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, each term is combined. Wait, no. Actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the variables don't interfere. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that might not be correct. Let me think again. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6\\) (the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but is that the case? Or is it that each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a term involving \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it will create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that the coefficient is \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps it's simply the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for a numerical coefficient. Wait, no, the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which includes all the \\(c\\) terms. But actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients combine. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributing to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) exponents. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but let me verify this. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that when you have two independent polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it becomes \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a numerical coefficient. Hmm, I'm getting confused. Wait, no, because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient is actually \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not a numerical coefficient; it's a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). But that would be the same as 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by each coefficient in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number. So, maybe I need to reconsider. Perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when the entire expression is expanded, but without considering the \\(c\\) terms. That is, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, because the other terms involve \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, the coefficients combine. Wait, let's think differently. Let's consider the entire expression as a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables are independent. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is simply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the part that doesn't involve \\(c\\), but that doesn't make sense either because \\(c\\) is part of the expression. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I calculated earlier, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Let me check this reasoning again. The sum of coefficients in a polynomial \\(P(c)\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). That seems correct. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6 is multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each of which has its own coefficient. Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Let me see if there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is simply the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not exactly accurate because the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. So, that's 6 times 64, which is 384. I think that's the correct approach. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, since the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by this term, the sum of all coefficients in this expansion is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

But since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, the second part's expansion can be anything because it's multiplied by 1 (since it's separate). Wait, no.

So, when we collect like terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms involving different powers of \\(c\\), but when multiplied by \\((a + b)^4\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion.

Because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient is 6 * (sum of coefficients in second expansion). So, yes, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of the two expansions, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.

So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through it again. The first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The second part: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product being a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of the second part, so the coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384. So, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the second part of the expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   Since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6 and the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " So, when I multiply the two expressions, the only part that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) is the 6 from \\((a + b)^4\\), multiplied by whatever the constant term is from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but is that correct? Let me think. When I multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, if I'm looking for a term with \\(a^2b^2\\), that term comes from taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and any term from the second part. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) terms, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and the constant term (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) from the second part. Because if I take any other term from the second part, it would have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would make the overall term have those variables, which we don't want. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). How do I find that? Again, using the binomial theorem. Let me write out \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). I need the term where the exponent is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs at \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. I don't think I missed anything here. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by considering the expansion of each part separately. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you're effectively adding up all the coefficients from the second expansion, each multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times\\) (sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). Now, how do I find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\). So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of coefficients is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term's coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), and when I set \\(c = 1\\), each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), so the sum is indeed \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\). So, that part is correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of two independent expansions. Since the terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which is 64.

But I'm not entirely confident about this approach. Let me try a different way. Maybe I should consider that when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But I'm still not sure if that's correct because the problem might only be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that perhaps the answer is just 6, but that seems too simple. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, so 384. But I think I need to verify this.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but the product also includes terms with \\(c\\). So, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But I'm not entirely sure if that's the case. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be 6, as the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that seems incorrect because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the other expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But I'm not entirely confident.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach it differently. Let me consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), if I set \\(c = 1\\), I get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times 64, which is 384. Therefore, the answer should be 384.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure. Let me think about how the product works. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second polynomial contributes its coefficient multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that would indeed be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit confused because I thought the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but maybe it's considering only the \\(a^2b^2\\) term regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion, but since we're just looking for the coefficient, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the other part. So, yes, 6 times 64 is 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think of it as the coefficient being 6 multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) part. So, that's 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of any term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But no, that's not quite right because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has its own coefficient, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) part, which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all possible terms from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, that's 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nBut I'm still a bit unsure because sometimes when you have multiple variables, the coefficient can be affected differently. Let me try to think of a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion would be \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this case would be zero because \\(a^2b^2\\) is not present. Wait, but that's a different case because the exponents are lower. Alternatively, if I have \\((a + b)^3 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), then the expansion is \\((a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would still be zero because \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present in the expansion. Wait, so maybe in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of coefficients in the other part, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But in my simpler example, that approach didn't yield the correct result because \\(a^2b^2\\) wasn't present. Wait, but in the original problem, \\((a + b)^4\\) does have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so when multiplied by the other expansion, it will create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the other expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, perhaps another way to look at it is that when you multiply two polynomials together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) by any term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, that's 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nI think that's the correct approach.
