    "text": " So, maybe the entire coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times whatever the constant term is in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply by a constant, it doesn't affect the exponent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, I want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term.

So, the coefficient is 120. Hmm, that seems right. Let me double-check the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed at \\(k = 2\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together, 6 * 20 = 120.

    "text": " Hmm, but actually, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find all the terms in the product where the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts are \\(a^2b^2\\), and then sum their coefficients. But wait, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which only affects the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), right? Because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But wait, no, that's not exactly correct. Because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will contribute a coefficient, and when multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, it will just add that coefficient to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other polynomial is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the other polynomial, effectively adding up all the coefficients from the other polynomial. So, first, let me confirm that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Is that correct? Let me think. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). Then, the product P(a, b) * Q(c) will have terms where each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in P, it will be multiplied by every term in Q, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P times the sum of all coefficients in Q. Because each term in Q contributes its coefficient multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, that seems correct. So, now, I need to compute two things: 1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found to be 6. 2. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial, I can substitute \\(c = 1\\), because that will make each term equal to its coefficient. So, let's compute \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Because sometimes, when dealing with negative exponents or variables, substituting 1 might not capture all terms correctly. But in this case, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) when \\(c = 1\\) is indeed 2^6 = 64, which is the sum of all coefficients. So, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Wait, but let me check my reasoning again. Because the problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first part, and the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. So, 6 * 64 = 384. That seems right. Alternatively, if I wanted to be extra thorough, I could expand both parts and see. But that might be time-consuming. Alternatively, I can think of it as the product of two polynomials, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients from each polynomial, but in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first polynomial, the second polynomial contributes its entire sum of coefficients. So, yes, I think 384 is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by multiplying the binomial coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) with the sum of coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1.

So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).

Now, I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\).

But no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term from the first part, and the second part is multiplied as a whole. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Alternatively, if I didn't substitute \\(c = 1\\), but instead considered that each term in the second polynomial is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, the coefficients from the second polynomial just scale the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.

So, that's correct. So, the sum is 64, so the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think differently. Maybe the problem is looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just the product of the coefficients from each part. Since \\((a + b)^4\\) contributes 6 to \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) contributes 64 when considering all coefficients, then 6 * 64 = 384.

The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, so it's the product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply these two, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second expression, the only term in the product that has \\(a^2b^2\\) will be \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not right because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a term with powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 6. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, no, that's not correct. Wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, each term is of the form \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion multiplied by 6, because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and then it's multiplied by each term in the other expansion. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\), which would give \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems too high. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me check again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and it's multiplied by each term in the other expansion, which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when you multiply 6 by each of these, you get terms like \\(6c^6\\), \\(36c^4\\), \\(90c^2\\), \\(120\\), \\(90c^{-2}\\), \\(36c^{-4}\\), \\(6c^{-6}\\), all multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for each \\(k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on \\(c\\). Wait, but that's not possible because in the product, each term is a product of \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it would be the sum of all coefficients from the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion multiplied by 6. But that would be 6 times 64, which is 384, as I thought earlier. But that seems too large. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible terms. So, perhaps the answer is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term, you might be considering only the constant term or something else. Wait, no, the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so in the entire product, each term is a combination of \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by evaluating the polynomial at \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) is only one term, and the other part is the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would indeed be 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then the rest is separate, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient in the product. So, I think 384 is the correct answer. Wait, but let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the only terms that will have \\(a^2b^2\\) are those where you take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and any term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\( (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, but that doesn't seem right because the product includes the second part. So, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64.

    "text": " So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is in the other part for the terms that don't involve \\(c\\). Wait, no, that might not be correct. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that are constants, i.e., where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because if we multiply a term from the first part, which is \\(a^2b^2\\), by a term from the second part, which is a constant (with \\(c^0\\)), then that would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Alternatively, if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that would give a term with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), which isn't what we're looking for. So, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. So, the first part gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part, when expanded, has a constant term of 20. So, when you multiply these together, the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. I think that's correct. But just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other term in the second expansion that could contribute. For example, if I have a term with \\(c^1\\) and a term with \\(c^{-1}\\) in the second expansion, but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they would give \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), which aren't the same as \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the constant term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).

Next, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"

Because when you multiply by that, only the constant term will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without introducing any \\(c\\) terms. So, how do I find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Again, I can use the binomial theorem. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(6 - 2m\\) on \\(c\\). We want the term where the exponent is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That is, 6 times 20, which is 120. So, the coefficient should be 120. Let me just double-check my reasoning. First, I expanded \\((a + b)^4\\) and found the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) correctly using the binomial coefficient. Then, I considered that the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the rest of the terms involving \\(c\\) would get multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), but only the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) would contribute to the coefficient without introducing any \\(c\\) terms. So, I correctly found the constant term by setting the exponent to zero and found that \\(m = 3\\), giving the binomial coefficient of 20. Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. I don't think I made any mistakes here, but let me just verify the calculations again. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is indeed 6, and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20. 6 multiplied by 20 is 120. Yep, that seems right. So, I think the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the terms involving \\(c\\) would multiply \\(a^2b^2\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, when you multiply out the entire expression, you'll have terms like \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the sum of all the coefficients from the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion, because each term in that expansion will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that can't be right because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, let's check that. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, when you expand \\((a + b)^4\\), you get terms like \\(a^4, a^3b, a^2b^2, ab^3, b^4\\), each multiplied by their respective coefficients. Then, when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), we need to multiply that by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which, as I thought earlier, is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has specific terms, and perhaps only one of them is a constant term, which would be the middle term. Because when you have \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the expansion will have terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\). The constant term is when the exponents cancel out, which would be when the number of \\(c\\)s and \\(1/c\\)s are equal. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when you choose 3 \\(c\\)s and 3 \\(1/c\\)s. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term is 6 * 20 = 120. But wait, that contradicts my earlier thought. So, which one is correct? Let me think carefully. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but it doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which includes terms with \\(c^6, c^5, c^4, c^3, c^2, c, 1, c^{-1}, c^{-2}, c^{-3}, c^{-4}, c^{-5}, c^{-6}\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6, a^2b^2c^5, \\ldots, a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each of those coefficients multiplies \\(a^2b^2\\). As I calculated earlier, the sum of the coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 * 64 = 384\\). But wait, that seems high. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, meaning the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, that would be the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20, as I calculated earlier. So, then the coefficient would be \\(6 * 20 = 120\\). Hmm, I'm confused now. Let me clarify the question: It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the expansion, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or something like that. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not right because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients don't just multiply like that. Wait, actually, when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables add up to that specific term. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I calculated earlier, the sum of coefficients is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems to contradict the idea that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only be multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think differently. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let's consider that \\((a + b)^4\\) is being multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand the entire expression, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which includes \\(c^6, 6c^5, 15c^4, 20c^3, 15c^2, 6c, 1, 6/c, 15/c^2, 20/c^3, 15/c^4, 6/c^5, 1/c^6\\). So, each of these terms is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times (1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1)\\). Wait, that's the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, as I calculated before. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. But wait, that seems too large. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. So, which is it? The problem says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". It doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. I need to clarify this. Let me think about how coefficients work in products of polynomials. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of the terms in each polynomial that combine to form that specific term. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product comes from taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiplying it by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the answer should be 384. But wait, that seems high. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. I'm a bit confused now. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from -6 to 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6, because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the answer is 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power, making the term independent of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, I think I need to clarify this. Let me consider an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it would be \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be zero because there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. Wait, no, that's not right because each term from \\((a + b)^2\\) is multiplied by each term from \\((c + 1/c)\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^0\\) from \\((a + b)^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), and similarly for other terms. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't exist in the product. Wait, that's confusing. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me go back to the original problem. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, in the product, each term is formed by multiplying a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) by a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6a^2b^2, multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As I calculated earlier, that sum is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. I think that's the correct approach. So, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n$\\boxed{384}$"

Wait, but actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second.

So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to find that. Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, I want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), I get \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when I multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by the constant term 20 from the other expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives a coefficient of 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives a constant term of 20. So, when multiplied together, 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense. I don't think I made a mistake here. So, yeah, the coefficient should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).

The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).

So, when you multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes 6*20=120. That seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes here.

    "text": " Hmm, let me think. When I multiply the two expressions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because only that term will not introduce any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factors, so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it will just give a multiple of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, is that right? Let me make sure. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) only, then the \\(c\\) terms in the second part must multiply to 1, so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains as a term with \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because \\(c^0 = 1\\), and that's the only term that won't have any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains as \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when we multiply these two parts together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. So, when we expand \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found. Then, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, when we multiply the two expansions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, giving \\(20a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 20 times 6, which is 120. Wait, no, hold on. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, no, I think I made a mistake here. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression and the constant term in the second expression. So, that would be 6 times 20, which is 120. So, that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me think again. Let me see: \\((a + b)^4\\) gives terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), \\(b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) are even numbers from 6 down to -6, in steps of 2. The constant term is when the exponent is 0, which is when \\(m = 3\\), as I found earlier, giving a coefficient of 20. So, when I multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But only the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, will not introduce any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), it gives \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2 = 120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120. So, I think that's correct.

So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because the entire expression is the product of two expansions, so when you multiply them, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), the \\(c\\) terms in the second part don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms.

But since we're only interested in the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts. So, the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). But wait, that's the sum of the coefficients. But in our case, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term, so maybe it's just 6 times the entire expansion, but that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second part, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the entire expansion is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), but we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, but since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) part, it's as if we're multiplying by the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems too large. Let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times each term in the second expansion, but since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's as if we're multiplying by the entire second expression. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems high. Wait, but let me think differently. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, since the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are in one polynomial and the \\(c\\) terms are in another, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only affected by the terms in the first polynomial, and the second polynomial contributes a factor that doesn't affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient, regardless of \\(c\\), it's as if we're multiplying by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 times 64 is 384. But let me confirm this with a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{1}{0} = 1\\), and the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\) is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be 1 times 2, which is 2. Let's check by expanding: \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), but if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's the sum of the coefficients, which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, that works. Similarly, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, another way to think about it is that when you have two independent variables, the coefficient of a term in one variable is multiplied by the entire expansion of the other variable. So, yes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the answer should be 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Another approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) for the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), but since \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) doesn't have a constant term, the only way to get a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is if the exponents cancel out. Wait, but in this case, we're not looking for a specific \\(c\\) term, but rather, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a constant term. Let's see: the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, to get a constant term, we need \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the sum of coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\), as I thought earlier. So, the sum of all coefficients is 64, but the constant term is 20. So, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of coefficients from the second expression, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if we were looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term, it would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, it's 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one variable is the product of the coefficients of that term in the first polynomial and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, so the specific term's coefficient is spread across all the terms in the second polynomial. So, yes, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of it as the product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and one in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are independent of the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first polynomial, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient, regardless of \\(c\\), it's as if we're multiplying by the sum of the coefficients of the second polynomial, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to see it is that when you have two polynomials, say \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), then the coefficient of a specific term in \\(P(a, b)\\) when multiplied by \\(Q(c)\\) is the coefficient in \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of the coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). Because each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), so the specific term's coefficient is spread across all the terms involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nSo, after all that, I think the coefficient is 384. But let me just do a quick check. Let me compute \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Now, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to a sum of terms, each of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). The sum of all coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's 6 times 64, which is 384. So, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

But wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, and the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms with various powers of \\(c\\), but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we might need to consider the term in the second part that has \\(c^0\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let me think about that. So, the overall expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part, which are 6 and 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Wait, but let me double-check that. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But in this case, since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, and the second part's constant term, which is 20, then yes, the total coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the answer. But just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me go through it again. First, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs at \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together, 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just 6 multiplied by 1? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), any term that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) would just contribute a factor of 1 when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all possible terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that don't involve \\(c\\). Wait, but that's not possible because every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has either a positive or negative power of \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second part. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). So, let's compute that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, does that make sense? Let me check again. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. When we multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we only need to consider the term in the second part that doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents, which is the constant term \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. So, I think that's the answer. But just to be thorough, let me consider if there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, I could think of the entire expression as a product of two separate expansions. The first expansion, \\((a + b)^4\\), gives terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), gives terms involving \\(c\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion by the constant term (in terms of \\(c\\)) from the second expansion. So, that's exactly what I did earlier. So, yeah, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"
