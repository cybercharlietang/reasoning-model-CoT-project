    "text": " So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is for the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(c^0\\) is 1, so it doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, let me think about that. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 because that would be the constant term. Let me use the binomial theorem again on this part. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, which means \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, since the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will multiply the constant term from the second part. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Let me go through it again. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) has a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a constant term with coefficient 20. So, when you multiply these two, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by 20, giving a total coefficient of 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. So, I think that's correct. But just to double-check, maybe I should consider if there's any other term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so it's only affected by the constant term in the second expression. So, yeah, 120 should be the correct coefficient.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.

    "text": " So, maybe the coefficient from the second part is just 1? Wait, no, that's not right.

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part, the second part's expansion doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, actually, no, that's not correct. Because if I'm taking the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would mean we're looking for the term where the \\(c\\) terms cancel out to give a constant term. So, maybe I need to consider the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\). So, let me think. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are equal, so that when multiplied together, the exponents cancel out. Let me use the binomial theorem again for this part. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).

We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we need to multiply the coefficient from the first part by the constant term from the second part. So, the coefficient from the first part is 6, and the constant term from the second part is 20. Therefore, the overall coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. When we multiply these two, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by the constant term from the second part, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. Yes, that seems right.

    "text": " That means I can treat \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as a constant when it comes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, no, actually, that's not quite right. Because when I multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider how this term interacts with the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, and when multiplied by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it will just carry along the coefficient from the \\(c\\) terms. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think I can consider the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as a single coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial multiplies each term in the second, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would only happen if the term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a constant term, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because otherwise, the product would have \\(c\\) terms attached to \\(a^2b^2\\), which would make it a different term altogether. So, to clarify, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if we multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to do that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)) gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but let me double-check that. So, when we expand \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found. Then, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a term with \\(c^0\\) which is 20. So, when we multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, giving 6 * 20 = 120. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is 6, and the constant term in the second part is 20, so their product is 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. I don't think I made any mistakes here, but let me just go through it again to be sure. First part: \\((a + b)^4\\), term \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Second part: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), term with \\(c^0\\) is when exponent is 0, which happens at \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiply 6 and 20 to get 120. Yep, that seems right.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from this part is 6.\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The exponent of \\(c\\) is zero when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\).

But since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), then actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, no, that can't be right because the second part is raised to the 6th power, which would have multiple terms. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first polynomial, \\((a + b)^4\\), because the second polynomial only has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), no \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we don't need to consider the \\(c\\) part. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product, so each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), etc., down to \\(c^{-6}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the product, each \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by a term from the second part. So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the problem is considering the entire product and wants the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense either because the coefficient would then be a sum of multiple terms, not a single coefficient. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because otherwise, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), so it's not a single term. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion, which is not a single number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the part of the product where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, so \\(c^0\\), but that's not specified. Hmm, maybe I need to re-examine the problem more carefully. Let me parse the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any term from the second part, so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, but that's not specified. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems too broad. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, which would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems high. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first factor, and the second factor is multiplied by it, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first factor, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second factor. But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times each term in the second expansion, which would result in multiple terms, each with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from -6 to 6. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply that we're considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, but that's not standard. Typically, when asked for the coefficient of a term in a product, it's considering the entire term, including other variables. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would mean that we're looking for the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought earlier. But let me check that. The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems correct, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then note that the second part doesn't affect it, but that doesn't seem right because the second part is multiplied by the first part. Wait, no, because the second part is multiplied by each term in the first part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would require more work. Let me try that approach. So, if we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is \\(a^2b^2\\), then we need to find the coefficient where in the product, the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, in the first part, we have \\(a^2b^2\\), and in the second part, we need a term that is \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product would be 6 * 20 = 120. So, that's 120. But wait, the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), it just asked for \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that's not a single number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that \\(c\\) terms are separate, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Since the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, then the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. But the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so perhaps it's 384. But I'm not sure. Wait, maybe I should think of it differently. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. So, in this case, we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\). But since the second polynomial only has \\(c\\) terms, which don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiply it by any term from the second polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would then be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that's not a single coefficient; it's a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1/1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384. Alternatively, if the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120, but since it's not specified, I think 384 is the correct answer. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) ranges from -6 to 6. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would correspond to \\(k = 2\\), and any \\(m\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of the coefficients from \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) only comes from \\(k = 2\\) in the first polynomial, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. The sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the answer is 384. But wait, earlier I thought of 120 when considering \\(c^0\\), but since the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), I think 384 is correct. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but I'm not sure. Wait, no, because \\(c\\) is another variable, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is separate from \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, since the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) contributes all possible terms involving \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, multiplied by whatever the constant term is from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Wait, no. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that doesn't sound right. Because if I'm just looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), then any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that's multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, actually, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's not correct either because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has different powers of \\(c\\), and when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those terms, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, no, because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that can't be right because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term would have a different power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. But wait, no, that's not correct either because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient times \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\). So, if you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then you're actually summing all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) times something. But that seems a bit off. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so we're looking for all terms in the expansion where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponents of \\(c\\) can be anything. So, in other words, we're considering all possible products where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if we set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems too large. Let me check that again. So, the idea is that when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. Since the sum of coefficients is 64, 6 times 64 is indeed 384. But wait, let me think differently. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that when you have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and the second part can contribute any term, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which doesn't make sense because the expansion includes terms with \\(c\\). So, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, let me check this with a smaller example to see if this makes sense. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding this, we have \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 1 times (c + 1/c), but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 1 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\((c + 1/c)\\), which is 0 because there's no constant term. Wait, but in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\), which is 2, so 1 times 2 is 2. But in reality, the expansion is \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't appear because it's multiplied by \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero, not 2. So, that contradicts my earlier approach. Therefore, my initial approach is wrong. So, where did I go wrong? I think I misunderstood the problem. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, each term has both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). But in the small example, that approach gave the wrong result because the coefficient was zero, not 2. So, perhaps the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but only if the \\(c\\) terms are constants. Wait, no, in the small example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because there's no term with \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, perhaps the correct way is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if you have \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), that's the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, in the small example, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\) is zero, which matches the result. So, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, let's calculate the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 20, which is 120. That makes sense because in the small example, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\) is zero, which correctly gives a coefficient of zero for \\(a^2b^2\\). So, putting it all together, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20.

But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, that doesn't seem right because the \\(c\\) terms might affect the coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by any term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), it would be \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) something involving \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps the coefficient is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because that would make the coefficient a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), which isn't possible since coefficients are constants. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". So, it's a product of two expressions, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times\\) something, but that something is the entire expansion, which is a sum of terms. That doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a single number. Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think differently. The expression is a product, so each term in the product is a combination of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part, but that's not possible because the second part is in terms of \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not. It's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, that might be it. Because when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion, so the total coefficient would be \\(6 \\times\\) (sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)). But what's the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)? The sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. So, when you multiply the two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product would be \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times\\) (sum of coefficients in \\(c\\) expansion). So, yes, that would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think of another approach. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients from each polynomial for the corresponding terms. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) includes terms with different powers of \\(c\\), so how does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which should be a constant. Therefore, I must be misunderstanding something. Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times each coefficient in the \\(c\\) expansion, but since we're only considering the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 64, making it 384. Hmm, I think that's the right approach. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with another method. Let's consider that \\((a + b)^4\\) is being multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, so its coefficient is 6. Now, when you multiply this by the entire expansion of the second part, each term in the second part is a term involving \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times each coefficient from the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we're essentially summing all the coefficients from the second expansion and multiplying by 6. The sum of coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiply it by each term in the second polynomial, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. So, that's 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), then we would need to find the specific coefficient in the second polynomial for \\(c^k\\) and multiply it by 6. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Let me think about the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). The sum of all coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c) = c + 1/c\\). Multiplying them together, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be 1 \u00d7 (c + 1/c), which is 1 \u00d7 2 = 2 when \\(c = 1\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2 \u00d7 (c + 1/c), which is 2 \u00d7 2 = 4. So, this seems to support the approach that the coefficient is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients from the second part.\n\nTherefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Let me compute the entire expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) separately and then see what the coefficient is when multiplied. So, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). The sum of the coefficients is 1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64, which matches what I had before.\n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in \\(6a^2b^2c^6 + 6a^2b^2c^4 + 90a^2b^2c^2 + 120a^2b^2 + 90a^2b^2/c^2 + 36a^2b^2/c^4 + 6a^2b^2/c^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\) is the sum of all these coefficients: 6 + 6 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6 = let's calculate that. 6 + 6 = 12; 12 + 90 = 102; 102 + 120 = 222; 222 + 90 = 312; 312 + 36 = 348; 348 + 6 = 354. Wait, that's 354, which is different from 384. Hmm, that's a problem. So, my previous approach was wrong. So, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake in calculating the sum. Let me recalculate the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). The coefficients are 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1. Summing them: 1 + 6 = 7; 7 + 15 = 22; 22 + 20 = 42; 42 + 15 = 57; 57 + 6 = 63; 63 + 1 = 64. So, the sum is indeed 64. But when I multiplied each term by 6, I thought the total would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But when I actually expanded it, I got 354. So, there's a discrepancy here. Therefore, my initial approach was incorrect.\n\nWait, so let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times each coefficient from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then summed up. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 (sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)), which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But when I actually expanded it, I got 354. So, where is the mistake?\n\nWait, no, actually, when I expanded \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I think I made a mistake in the coefficients. Let me recompute the expansion.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, the terms are:\n\n- \\(k=0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0} c^{6} = 1 \\times c^6\\)\n- \\(k=1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1} c^{4} = 6 \\times c^4\\)\n- \\(k=2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2} c^{2} = 15 \\times c^2\\)\n- \\(k=3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20 \\times 1\\)\n- \\(k=4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4} c^{-2} = 15 \\times c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(k=5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5} c^{-4} = 6 \\times c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(k=6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6} c^{-6} = 1 \\times c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the expansion is correct. The coefficients are 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1. The sum is 64.\n\nNow, when I multiply each of these by 6, I should get the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6 \u00d7 1 = 6.\n\nSimilarly, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 6 \u00d7 6 = 36.\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^2\\) is 6 \u00d7 15 = 90.\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2/c^2\\) is 6 \u00d7 15 = 90.\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2/c^4\\) is 6 \u00d7 6 = 36.\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2/c^6\\) is 6 \u00d7 1 = 6.\n\nNow, if we sum all these coefficients, we get 6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6.\n\nLet me calculate that step by step:\n\n6 + 36 = 42\n\n42 + 90 = 132\n\n132 + 120 = 252\n\n252 + 90 = 342\n\n342 + 36 = 378\n\n378 + 6 = 384.\n\nAh, so I must have made a calculation mistake earlier when I thought it was 354. So, the correct sum is indeed 384.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384.\n\nSo, to summarize, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem and properties of polynomial multiplication.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " Wait, is that correct? Let me think. When I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion will be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that means I need to consider all possible terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), still result in \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, so when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that the power of \\(c\\) should be zero, so that the term is just \\(a^2b^2\\) times a constant. So, in other words, I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because when I multiply that by \\(a^2b^2\\), I get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant, which is the term I'm interested in. So, let me figure out what the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) will give \\(c^0\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term (which is 20) from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.

But that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the first factor, and the second factor is in terms of \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. But that would mean the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and ignoring the second part. But that seems unlikely because the second part is multiplied in. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, which suggests that perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the \\(c\\) terms. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider the entire expansion and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so any term in the product that has \\(a^2b^2\\) would have the form \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{something with } c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is usually a number. So, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is a separate consideration. Alternatively, maybe the problem is a typo, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we're supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. That would make more sense. So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. But the problem as stated is just \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe that's the case. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is in two variables, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) is another variable, but the problem is only asking about \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems odd because the problem is likely expecting a numerical answer. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is a separate expansion, but since it's multiplied, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, let's expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. As I did before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nNext, let's consider \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand this using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems to be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but considering only the terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the constant term in \\(c\\). So, let me proceed under that assumption.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is equal to 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem. As I did before, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), it just said \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I'm overcomplicating again. Let me think. If the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical answer. So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's not a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and that's the answer. But that seems too simple, and the second part is given, so probably the problem is expecting to consider the entire product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of the entire product, but only considering the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). That would make the coefficient a number, which is 6 times 20, which is 120. So, perhaps that's the intended answer.\n\nWait, let me check again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that's not a number, so perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is a separate expansion, so the coefficient remains 6. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would involve multiplying the terms from both expansions, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number, so perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120, as I calculated before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and that's the answer. But that seems too simple, and the problem includes both parts, so I think the intended answer is 120, considering the constant term in \\(c\\).\n\nWait, let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then in the product, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because coefficients are usually numbers. Therefore, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and that's the answer. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but only considering the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, which would be 6 times 20, which is 120. So, perhaps that's the intended answer.\n\nWait, let me check an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it's \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, but that's not correct because \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present. Alternatively, if I have \\((a + b)^3 \\times (c + 1/c)^3\\), then the expansion would have terms like \\(a^3b^0c^3\\), \\(3a^2b c^{2}\\), etc. But \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present unless the exponents add up. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\).

Therefore, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and that's the answer.

    "text": " Wait, actually, no. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand both parts, I'm going to get terms like \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that term will appear in the product for each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a part of the product, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times whatever the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is just 6, and when you multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that can't be right because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the \\(c\\) terms are irrelevant because the problem is only concerned with the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6, and the rest of the expression involving \\(c\\) doesn't affect it. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check that again. Let me think of the entire product as two separate parts: one involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the question is, does the problem consider the entire expression, or is it only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms? I think it's the former. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so plugging \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384? That seems high. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate variables, and the problem is only asking about the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) part. Wait, but the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so it's a product of two expressions. So, when you expand the product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, which includes various powers of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), which has a coefficient of 6, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times any \\(c\\) term is 6 times the coefficient of that \\(c\\) term. So, to find the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, you would sum all those coefficients. But wait, that's not correct because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2\\) times any \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributing to the coefficient. But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, setting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1/1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6, regardless of what happens with \\(c\\). But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients combine. Let me think differently. Maybe I should treat the entire expression as a product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but since the \\(c\\) terms are separate, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is simply 6, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that can't be correct because the entire expression is a product, so each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, each with their own coefficients. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times any \\(c\\) term is 6 times the coefficient of that \\(c\\) term. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it and the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a distraction. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. Let me try to think of it as two separate expansions. The first expansion, \\((a + b)^4\\), has \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second expansion, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. Let me write that out: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\). Now, when I multiply the two expansions together, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion. As I thought earlier, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. But let me verify this because I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that for each term in the product, if it has \\(a^2b^2\\), its coefficient is included. But since the second expansion is a polynomial in \\(c\\), each term in the product will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a term in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all coefficients of terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, which is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me check this again. Let me consider that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply to give that specific term. In this case, the specific term is \\(a^2b^2\\), which can only come from the first polynomial, since the second polynomial doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, yes, I think that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   This expansion will have terms of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we note that the entire expansion of this part will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.\n\n3. **Determine the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion:**\n   Setting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), which is the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\n4. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first expansion (6) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion (64), resulting in \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

Then, when I multiply this by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply together to give that term. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too high. Let me check my reasoning again. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which includes all the \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is separate from \\(c\\). Wait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, meaning that the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be 6 times each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Wait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would just be 6, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be present in each of those products, but the coefficient would be 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a single coefficient, not a polynomial. Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which would involve all possible powers of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient in the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts, but that seems unlikely. Wait, perhaps I should think of the entire expression as a product, and when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply by the second expression, you're distributing it across all terms of the first. Wait, perhaps I should think of the entire expression as a product, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of each term in the second expansion. But the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure if that's the correct interpretation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, but that's not specified. Wait, let me check the problem again: it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, as each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is a separate expression, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is a product of the two expressions. So, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expression, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me verify this with another approach. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as the product of two independent expansions. The first expansion gives me terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second gives me terms involving \\(c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be obtained by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and multiplying it by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1/1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, since this term is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that term must come from the product where the \\(c\\) terms multiply to give a constant term, right? Because if there's any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) in the term, it won't be part of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). Therefore, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent is zero, which occurs at \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. Yeah, that seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The constant term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

The sum of the coefficients of a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64.

Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. When you have two expressions multiplied together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second.

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire sum of the coefficients in the second part. Wait, that doesn't sound right because the second part is not a constant. Let me think again. Let me denote the first part as \\(P = (a + b)^4\\) and the second part as \\(Q = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, the product is \\(P \\times Q\\). Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P \\times Q\\) is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(Q\\), because each term in \\(Q\\) is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term in \\(Q\\) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the respective \\(c\\) term. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we need to consider all possible ways \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by terms from \\(Q\\).

Wait, no, that's not correct because the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\) would be when you set \\(c = 1\\), right? Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(Q\\) gives the sum of all coefficients.

The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Since the product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, no, because when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think differently.

But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the question is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. Therefore, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the entire expression. So, in the entire expression, which is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the answer is just 6, because the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the other part is multiplied by it, but since we're considering the entire expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my approach. Let me try a different way. Maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then consider that it's multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's just the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that when multiplying two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) are separate, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient in the first part times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would mean it's a polynomial, not a number. So, I'm confused. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of the entire expression, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I thought earlier, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. But let me check this another way. Let me compute \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) separately. Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Now, when I multiply this by \\((a + b)^4\\), which has a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, the product will have terms like \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). The sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) from \\(k=0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, that makes sense now. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384. I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{384}\\)"

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the other factors from the second part would just be multiplied by 1, right? So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't seem right because that would be a huge number.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and we're multiplying by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a separate expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right because that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expression. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the expansion has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of the two expressions. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that term would be the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) and each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a scalar multiple when multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems off because \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean the coefficient when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., when the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a constant term. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expression, you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant, contributing to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms would have some power of \\(c\\), so they wouldn't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find two things: 1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we found to be 6. 2. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Once I have both, I can multiply them together to get the final coefficient. So, let's focus on finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\) so \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, correct. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), so that's correct. Therefore, multiplying them gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. I think that makes sense because when you multiply the two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, but since we're only interested in the term without \\(c\\), we're effectively taking the product of the coefficients from each part where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, which happens only when the exponent is zero. So, yeah, I'm confident the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\Rightarrow k = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both parts:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Alternatively, maybe it's better to consider that since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) terms, so we need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents.

Now, I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the only term that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will result in a term that has only \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), I get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).

Wait, but that seems a bit off. Let me think again. Suppose I have two expressions, A and B. If A = a^2b^2 * something, and B = c^k * something else, then when I multiply A and B, the terms involving a^2b^2 would be a^2b^2 multiplied by each term in B. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of a^2b^2, which doesn't involve c, that would mean that any term in B that has c^0 would contribute to the coefficient. Because if B has a term with c^k where k \u2260 0, then when multiplied by a^2b^2, it would result in a term with a^2b^2c^k, which is different from a^2b^2. So, only the term in B with c^0 would contribute to the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the product. Therefore, I need to find the coefficient of c^0 in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when that term is multiplied by a^2b^2, it will give a term a^2b^2c^0, which is just a^2b^2, and the coefficient will be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, first, I found that the coefficient of a^2b^2 in (a + b)^4 is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of c^0 in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of c to be 0, so we set 6 - 2m = 0. Solving for m: 6 - 2m = 0 \u2192 2m = 6 \u2192 m = 3. So, the term where m=3 is the one with c^0. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of c^0 in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through it again. The first part: (a + b)^4, coefficient of a^2b^2 is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The second part: (c + 1/c)^6, looking for the term where c^0, which is when m=3, so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes here.

Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but when we multiply the two expansions together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, first, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do that, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).

Now, we're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.

Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as the product of two expansions, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed the product of the coefficients from each part where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out to zero. So, yes, 120 should be the correct coefficient. I think that's it.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break it down into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both parts:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."
