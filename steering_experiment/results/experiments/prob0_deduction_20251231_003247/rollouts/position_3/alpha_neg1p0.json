    "text": " So maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLooking at \\((a + b)^4\\), if I expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. So the expansion would be \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) here is 6. Okay, that's straightforward.\n\nBut wait, the problem is not just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So I think I need to consider the entire expression. But the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, so maybe the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)? Or does it?\n\nWait, no, because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So maybe I can treat the two parts separately.\n\nIn other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) part because it's a separate variable. So maybe the coefficient remains 6? But that seems too easy, so I must be missing something.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But that doesn't seem right either because the second part isn't just a constant; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\).\n\nWait, maybe I need to think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So that means, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every possible term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut wait, that might not be correct. Let me think again. When you have a product of two expressions, say \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), then the coefficient of a specific term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is just the coefficient in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the entire \\(Q(c)\\), because \\(Q(c)\\) doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\).\n\nWait, but that might not be the case. Let me clarify. If I have \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\), then each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\). So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(Q(c)\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So that would mean I need to sum over all possible \\(k\\), the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(Q(c)\\).\n\nWait, but that would be equivalent to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). Because summing over all \\(k\\) the coefficients of \\(c^k\\) in \\(Q(c)\\) is the same as evaluating \\(Q(1)\\), since substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives the sum of all coefficients.\n\nSo, let me check that. If I set \\(c = 1\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from \\(P(a, b)\\)) multiplied by 64, which is 384. So the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because sometimes, when you have multiple variables, the way the coefficients interact can be tricky. Let me think again.\n\nThe original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanded, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m}\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So we need to find all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So that would mean \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNow, for each such term, the coefficient from the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) times \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum over all possible \\(m\\) the coefficients \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Because each term in the second part will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, and we're summing over all possible \\(c\\) exponents.\n\nSo the total coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, that seems correct. Alternatively, if I think about it, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. So 6 times 64 is 384.\n\nLet me double-check my steps. First, I expanded \\((a + b)^4\\) and found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, I considered that this term will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient gets multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in that expansion, which is 64. So 6 times 64 is indeed 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to compute the entire product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can ignore the \\(c\\) terms and just take the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients from the second part.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), we need to consider that coefficient as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so regardless of what happens with \\(c\\), the coefficient is just 6 times whatever comes from the second part. But since the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\), unless we're considering the coefficient independent of \\(c\\). Hmm, but the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which usually refers to the numerical coefficient, treating other variables as constants. But in this case, the expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), unless we're summing over all coefficients in \\(c\\).\n\nWait, maybe I should clarify the question. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So in the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean summing over all possible coefficients from the \\(c\\) terms.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Hmm, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying \\(c\\), so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then in the product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, probably an integer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. Let me check that.\n\nIf the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we need to find the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero. So in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify the power of \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So I'm confused. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), meaning summing over all coefficients in \\(c\\). That would give 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and treating \\(c\\) as a constant. In that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a function of \\(c\\).\n\nWait, maybe the problem is written correctly, and I'm overcomplicating it. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So in the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), specifically \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not a numerical coefficient, so perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean summing over all coefficients in \\(c\\), giving 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that the entire expression is a product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems incorrect because the coefficient should be a number.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible terms, but that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense in the context of the question.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^{10}\\) or something similar, but as it stands, I have to work with what's given.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering that \\(c\\) is another variable, but the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps I'm supposed to treat \\(c\\) as a constant and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a function of \\(c\\).\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So when you multiply these two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a number. So perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean summing over all possible coefficients in \\(c\\). So that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, let me check that again. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So yes, the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nSo, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nI think that's the correct approach. So the final answer should be 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " \n\nSo, in this case, the expression is \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me write out the expansion for that. The binomial theorem tells me that each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. \n\nI need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need the term where the exponent of \\(a\\) is 2 and the exponent of \\(b\\) is 2. So, let's set \\(4 - k = 2\\) because the exponent of \\(a\\) is \\(4 - k\\). Solving for \\(k\\), I get \\(k = 2\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, that part is 6. \n\nNow, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I notice that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). That means when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but actually, no. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and then I multiply it by every term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is a single term, and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it will produce terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, that implies that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is simply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expression evaluated at a certain point? Wait, no, that can't be right because the second expression is in terms of \\(c\\), which is a different variable. So, actually, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that is present in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it becomes \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(c\\) and \\(a\\), \\(b\\) are different variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but none of those terms will affect the exponent of \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). \n\nWait, so actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a single number, not an expression in terms of \\(c\\). So, maybe I misunderstood the problem. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of the entire expression, treating \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as variables. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit off because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 would be 384. But that seems too large. \n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the question is asking for a numerical coefficient. \n\nWait, perhaps I misread the problem. Maybe the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power. Because otherwise, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would involve terms with \\(c\\) in them, which isn't a single number. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would make sense. \n\nAssuming that, let me proceed. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nFirst, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is needed. Let me compute that. \n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). \n\nThus, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. \n\nNow, since the original expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 multiplied by 20. \n\nSo, 6 times 20 is 120. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (assuming that the problem actually meant \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)) is 120. \n\nWait, but let me double-check. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without mentioning \\(c\\). So, perhaps I was supposed to treat \\(c\\) as a variable and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are usually constants. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which again isn't a single number. \n\nSo, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo or misinterpretation, but given the context, I think 120 is the intended answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\n\\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the original expression also has another part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider this part as well. But wait, the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, does that mean I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms at all? Let me think.\n\nActually, the expression is a product of two parts: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them together, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since the question is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think that term must come from the product where the \\(c\\) terms multiply to 1, so they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms.\n\nWait, that might not make sense. Let me clarify. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is just a coefficient times \\(a^2b^2\\), and when multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it would result in each term of the \\(c\\) expansion multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would actually mean that we're looking for the sum of all coefficients from the \\(c\\) expansion that are multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps the \\(c\\) terms are just part of the overall expression, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because then it would be a polynomial in \\(c\\) as well.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, in the entire expansion, how many times does \\(a^2b^2\\) appear, and what is the sum of the coefficients for all those terms. So, for each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient from the \\(c\\) expansion.\n\nWait, that might be it. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would contribute to the coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nBut wait, let me think again. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems too high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so that the coefficient is 6 times the constant term in the \\(c\\) expansion.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the only term that would contribute is when the \\(c\\) terms multiply to 1, i.e., the constant term. So, I should find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6.\n\nSo, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the constant term is 20, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Therefore, the coefficient in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 6 * 64 = 384, but that was when considering all coefficients. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be a term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) times some combination of \\(c\\) terms. However, if we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, now I'm confused. Let me clarify: when we multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 \\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would actually include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems too large. Let me check with a smaller exponent to see if this makes sense. Suppose instead of 4 and 6, we had lower exponents. Let's say we have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we have \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, that's not helpful. Maybe another example: \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). Expanding, \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c^2 + 2c*(1/c) + (1/c)^2)\\) which is \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 2ab times 2, so 4ab, but wait, no, that's not right. Actually, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(2ab\\) in the first would be multiplied by 2 in the second, giving 4ab, but that's not \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because there's no term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is formed. Wait, but that's not correct because in \\((a + b)^2\\), the highest power is \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\), but when multiplied by the second polynomial, which has terms in \\(c^2\\) and \\(1/c^2\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would only come from \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term 2 in the second polynomial, so the coefficient would be 2 * 1 (since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 1, from \\(a^2b^0\\) and \\(a^0b^2\\), but wait, actually in \\((a + b)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) is 1, and \\(a^0b^2\\) is also 1, but \\(a^1b^1\\) is 2. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't exist in \\((a + b)^2\\), so the coefficient would be zero. Hmm, maybe this approach is not correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me go back. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part comes from \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). Now, when this is multiplied by the entire second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second part is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes that coefficient times \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nThe sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the constant term was 20, which would give 6 * 20 = 120. Now I'm confused. Let me clarify: if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) (i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the \\(c\\) expansion), then it's 120.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the \\(c\\) expansion multiplied by 6. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut that seems too high. Let me check with a different approach. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it just says \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of \\(c\\). So, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a part of the product; the entire product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), that would mean adding up all the coefficients of terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, which would indeed be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so I think it's considering all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all terms in the other polynomial. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a^2b^2. When you multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which expands to a sum of terms, each of the form coefficient * c^k, the result is 6a^2b^2 times each of those terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion, because each coefficient is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), and we're summing all those contributions.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought the constant term was 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. Which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), i.e., the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, giving a constant. So, that would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\), and is asking for the coefficient of the monomial \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include any power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think about how the product works. When you have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, each of which has a coefficient and a power of \\(c\\). Therefore, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (regardless of \\(c\\)) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Since the sum of coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives 64, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, that seems correct because if you think of the entire product as a polynomial, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), each with their own coefficients. So, the total coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit unsure. Let me check with a simpler example. Suppose we have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion is \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 1 + 1 = 2, so the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would be 2. But in reality, the expansion is \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) is indeed 2, considering all powers of \\(c\\). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, which is 1 (from the first part) times 2 (sum of coefficients in the second part). So, that seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the constant term was 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. Maybe I was confused between the constant term and the sum of all coefficients. Let me confirm:\n\n- Sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n- The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting the exponent of \\(c\\) to zero, which we calculated as 20.\n\nSo, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nIf it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so I think it's the first case, 384.\n\nWait, but let me check the original problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, that seems counterintuitive because in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient in the first part multiplied by the entire second part. So, the coefficient would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would be 120. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's 384.\n\nWait, but let me think differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that the product is a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the \\(c\\) expansion multiplied by 6, because each term in the \\(c\\) expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think about another approach. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), which has a coefficient of 6. Now, when we multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a separate polynomial, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit unsure because in some contexts, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term in a product, you might only consider the constant term, but in this case, since \\(c\\) is a separate variable, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, I think 384 is correct.\n\nWait, but let me check with a different example to make sure. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion would be \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be 1 * (1 + 1) = 2, because \\(a^2\\) is multiplied by both \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2 * (1 + 1) = 4, and the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) would be 1 * (1 + 1) = 2. So, in this case, the coefficients of \\(a^2\\), \\(ab\\), and \\(b^2\\) are each doubled because they're multiplied by both \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 2, which is 1 (from the first part) times 2 (sum of coefficients in the second part).\n\nSimilarly, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   - The term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   - The sum of all coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   - The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{384}\\)"

I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), which means I need \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\). So, let me set up the equation: \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a^{4 - k}\\) and \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b^k\\). Solving \\(4 - k = 2\\) gives \\(k = 2\\), which is consistent with the exponent on \\(b\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nNow, the expression also has another part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm supposed to multiply this with \\((a + b)^4\\), but the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think that the part with \\(c\\) doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because they are different variables. So, maybe I just need to consider the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second. \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, if I'm only looking for the term with \\(a^2b^2\\), then the rest of the expression involving \\(c\\) would just be a constant multiplier, right? Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, that doesn't sound quite right. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), so when you multiply it by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you'd have \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product. Wait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, when you expand the entire expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), and the coefficients add up when you consider all possible terms. \n\nWait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and then it's multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient just gets scaled by that. \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but it's part of a larger expression that also includes \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) contributes a coefficient that multiplies \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nBut wait, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), because that makes each term's coefficient visible. So, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but since \\(c\\) is a separate variable, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expression, but that can't be right because the coefficient should be a constant, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me approach it differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^{k} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^{k}c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nSo, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Then, the exponent on \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) contributes a coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), and since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), we just sum all those coefficients. \n\nWait, no, because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the product, each term will have different powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't a single number because it's multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be, because the coefficient should be a constant, not a function of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we just take the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nAs I thought earlier, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but let me verify this by another approach. Let's consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the entire expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded, and each term in that expansion will be multiplied by 6, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, giving 384. \n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the entire expression is a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is simply the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again: when you have two separate variables, \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is... Wait, no, because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a separate polynomial, so when you multiply by \\((a + b)^4\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term in the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) part, regardless of the \\(c\\) part. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient just scales by that. \n\nSo, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64, as I found earlier by setting \\(c = 1\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me check this another way. Let's expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem: \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for each term \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nNow, when I multiply this by \\((a + b)^4\\), which has a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. So, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the other expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me confirm this with a smaller example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\). The product would be \\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be 1 * (1 + 1) = 2, because the coefficients of \\(c^0\\) in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\) are 1 and 1. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 1 * 2 = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2 * (1 + 1) = 4, and the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) would be 1 * 2 = 2. \n\nWait, but in this case, the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\) is 2, so for each term in \\((a + b)^2\\), the coefficient is multiplied by 2. So, that seems to align with the idea that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the original problem is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nTherefore, I think the coefficient is 384. But let me just make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so in the product, each term will be of the form \\(a^{4 - k}b^{k}c^{6 - 2m}\\) with coefficients \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). For \\(a^2b^2\\), we have \\(4 - k = 2\\) so \\(k = 2\\), and \\(m\\) can be from 0 to 6. So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). \n\nBut \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\), so the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, since the expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we consider the sum of all coefficients in this expansion, which is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), I need to find the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. Let me write that down. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, I want \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a^2\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is equal to \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. That part seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the expression also includes \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm supposed to find the coefficient in the entire product, so I guess I need to consider how this part interacts with the first part. But wait, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), right? So, maybe the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, is that correct?\n\nLet me think again. The entire expression is the product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\) when multiplying. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not quite right because each term is multiplied by each term in the other expansion. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the variables are different. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, perhaps the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all independent, so when you expand the product, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will only multiply with the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that have \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is a different term. So, maybe I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because that's the only term that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) will give a term with \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nLet me check that. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find the term in the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\), because \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0 = a^2b^2\\). If we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any other power of \\(c\\), we'll get a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't what we're looking for. So, only the term with \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWe already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6 and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, the overall coefficient in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6, as \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(k = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when we multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, giving a total coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there any other term that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by other terms from the second expansion? For example, if we have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and another term from the second expansion that cancels out the \\(c^k\\), but no, because each term in the product is a combination of terms from both expansions. So, to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\), we have to pick \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and \\(c^0\\) from the second, because any other term from the second expansion would introduce a power of \\(c\\), which we don't want. So, yes, the only contribution is from the product of these two terms, so the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we first determine the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem, which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which occurs when \\(k = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients together, we get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

Hmm, but that seems complicated. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because when you expand the product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since we're only interested in terms where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared, the \\(c\\) terms can be anything. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems too straightforward, but let me check again.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because when you expand the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but is that accurate? Because when you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that term. In this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient becomes 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Let me think again. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will have the form \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\text{(some terms involving c)}\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check this by expanding both parts separately and then multiplying. Let me try that.\n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\). As we did before, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\). Now, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). The sum of all coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\), as before.\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another approach: since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the same as if I multiplied the coefficient from the first expansion by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because when you multiply by all the terms in the second polynomial, each term contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) part. So, yes, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to collect like terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but just to double-check, maybe I can think of it as:\n\nThe entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the \\(6a^2b^2\\) term in the first part, and when multiplied by each term in the second part, each of those terms contributes to the overall coefficient. So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), giving the coefficient:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nThe sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives:\n\\[\n(1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is:\n\\[\n6 \\times 64 = 384\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " \n\nSo, in this case, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me write that out using the binomial theorem. The expansion would be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\n\nI'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so that's \\(a^2b^2\\). To find the coefficient of this term, I need to find the value of \\(k\\) such that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, when \\(k = 2\\), the term is:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating the binomial coefficient, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the problem is that this is multiplied by another expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since multiplication is commutative, I can consider the coefficients separately because the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different and don't interfere with each other.\n\nWait, but actually, the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part, and \\(c\\) is in another. So, when I multiply these two expansions together, the terms will combine. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can ignore the terms involving \\(c\\) because they won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. In other words, the \\(c\\) terms will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), I can treat them separately.\n\nWait, but actually, no. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, each multiplication will contribute a factor to the coefficient.\n\nWait, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. Actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and then multiply it by each term from the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each of those terms will have different powers of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think I might have misread the problem.\n\nWait, actually, no. Let me check the problem again. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, I think it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, in the entire expansion, how many times does \\(a^2b^2\\) appear, and what is its coefficient, regardless of the \\(c\\) part.\n\nBut that doesn't make much sense because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you're introducing factors with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of the coefficients of each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\).\n\nWait, but that seems a bit convoluted. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a sum of multiple terms depending on the power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the constant term with respect to \\(c\\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that any term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) would contribute to the coefficient. But that seems unlikely because the coefficient would then be a sum of multiple coefficients from the second expression. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nLet me try to clarify. The problem says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's a bit ambiguous. But in the context of such problems, usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term that includes multiple variables, it's implied that you're looking for the coefficient when all other variables are considered as part of the term. So, in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and the entire expression is multiplied by the second part. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is not a single number but a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all the terms, but since \\(c\\) is another variable, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems complicated, and I don't think that's what is intended.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). That makes more sense because then the coefficient would be a single number, not a polynomial.\n\nSo, let me proceed under that assumption. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nTo do this, I can first find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found to be 6. Then, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Once I have both coefficients, I can multiply them together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\).\n\nSo, let's tackle the second part: finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem for this. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\) => \\(k = 3\\). So, the term is:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\n\\]\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Since these two coefficients multiply when we take the product of the two expressions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent is 0 is when \\(k = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But since the problem just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and given that the expression includes \\(c\\), I think the intended interpretation is to find the coefficient when considering the constant term in \\(c\\), i.e., \\(c^0\\), so that the overall term is \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Suppose I didn't consider the \\(c\\) part, and just took the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as 6, and then multiplied by the entire second expression, then the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Therefore, I think my initial interpretation was correct, that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nSo, to recap, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem. Alternatively, I could consider the entire expansion as a product of two independent expansions. So, when I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). Similarly, expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives terms with different powers of \\(c\\).\n\nWhen I multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem to be what the problem is asking for.\n\nTherefore, I think the problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). So, that would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem was only considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and ignoring \\(c\\), then the coefficient would just be 6, but that seems unlikely because the expression includes \\(c\\). Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the coefficient is 120.\n\nJust to make sure, let me consider an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding \\((a + b)^2\\) gives \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). Expanding \\((c + 1/c)^1\\) gives \\(c + 1/c\\). Now, multiplying these together:\n\n\\[\n(a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c) = a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\n\\]\n\nNow, if I look for the coefficient of \\(a^2\\), it would be \\(c + 1/c\\). But if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term, then it would be the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. But in this case, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is zero because the expansion of \\((c + 1/c)^1\\) doesn't have a constant term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2c^0\\) would be zero.\n\nBut in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but in my example, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) is zero because there's no constant term in the second expansion. So, in our problem, since there is a constant term, the coefficient is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if I had a different exponent on \\(c\\), say \\((c + 1/c)^2\\), which expands to \\(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) would be 2, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 2 = 12.\n\nWait, but in our problem, the exponent is 6, so the constant term is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nSo, to summarize, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 120, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product. Therefore, the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem, which is 6. Next, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is calculated using the binomial theorem, resulting in 20. Multiplying these coefficients together gives the final coefficient of 120.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " So maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLet me focus on the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this would expand to \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So the coefficients here are the binomial coefficients for n=4, which are 1, 4, 6, 4, 1. So the expansion would be \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, in this expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. That part seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of these two expansions. Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables, and \\(c\\) is another variable. So when I multiply these two expressions, I'm going to get terms involving \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). But the problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to find all the terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and then find the coefficient for that particular term, which might involve the coefficients from the second expansion.\n\nWait, but actually, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion by some term from the second expansion \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion's value. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because \\(c\\) is a separate variable. So actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient in the first expansion because when you multiply by the second expansion, which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient would just be the product of the coefficients from each expansion.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So when you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and when multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So each term in the product will be \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means we're looking for the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So in other words, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, that makes sense. So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\). So let me compute that. \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second expansion. But wait, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product, so perhaps it's just 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion, which is 6*64=384, as I thought earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the expression is a product of two polynomials. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and when multiplied by any term from the second part, it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times something with \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient becomes 6*(sum of coefficients in second expansion).\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Let me think about how polynomial multiplication works. If I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c), then when I multiply them, each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product P*Q is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q, because each term in Q contributes a factor that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term but just adds a coefficient.\n\nSo, in this case, P(a, b) is \\((a + b)^4\\), and Q(c) is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P is 6, as we saw earlier. The sum of the coefficients in Q is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so Q(1) = \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product P*Q is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I should consider the problem differently. Suppose I'm looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and then multiplied by each term from the second part. So each term in the product would be \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So the coefficient for each such term would be \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that means we're summing over all possible m, which gives us \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 6 \\times 2^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the coefficient is 384. I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm not missing something. Another way to approach this is to consider that in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent. So, when we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can treat the part involving \\(c\\) as a separate polynomial and just multiply the coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the entire second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), whose sum of coefficients is 64, as we saw. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have us consider the term \\(a^2b^2\\) along with some term involving \\(c\\), but the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would just be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion's contribution, which is the sum of its coefficients. So, yes, 384.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe the problem is intended to have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some specific term involving \\(c\\), but the problem doesn't specify, so I think it's safe to assume that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) term, which would mean summing over all possible \\(c\\) terms. So, 384 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would have to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second part and multiply them. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), we have to consider all possible \\(c\\) terms, so we multiply by the sum of coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1.

    "text": " So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLooking at the first part of the expression, \\((a + b)^4\\), I can expand this using the binomial theorem. Let me write that out:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\n\nSo, each term in this expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). Now, the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That means I need to find the value of \\(k\\) such that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me check that: if \\(k = 2\\), then the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is the number of ways to choose 2 items from 4, that's equal to \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Okay, that part seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient I found. Wait, but hold on. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply these two parts together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the expansion of the second part.\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so does that mean I just need to consider the coefficient from the first part and then see how it's affected by the second part? Hmm, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, because the entire expression is a product of two expansions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that implies that in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is combined with terms from the second expansion that don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), right? Because if the second expansion had terms with \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), then when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they would create higher degree terms in \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), which aren't part of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term we're interested in.\n\nWait, but actually, the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), so when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, the resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be 6 times whatever the coefficient is from the second part when the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) result in a constant term, i.e., when the exponents cancel out.\n\nWait, that might not be correct. Let me clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Since the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which are in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, each term in the product will be of the form \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{-k}\\), etc. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first part, but only when the second part contributes a term that doesn't change the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, but actually, since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), every term in the second expansion is just a multiple of \\(c^m\\) for some integer \\(m\\). Therefore, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each product will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a different power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would only include the term where the second part contributes a constant term, i.e., where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because if the second part contributes a term with \\(c^k\\) where \\(k \\neq 0\\), then the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is a different term, not just \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, so that means I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because that's the term that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) will give me a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part.\n\nSo, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nLet me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion would be:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\):\n\n\\(6 - 2m = 0\\)\n\\(2m = 6\\)\n\\(m = 3\\)\n\nSo, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the constant term. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\n\\]\n\nWait, let me check that calculation again because 6! is 720, and 3! is 6, so 6!/(3!3!) = 720/(6*6) = 720/36 = 20. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part).\n\nCalculating that: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the entire product, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first expansion, and it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, but wait, no, that's not correct because the second expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which are different terms. The only way to get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) is when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion, which is \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed the product of the coefficients from the first part and the constant term in the second part.\n\nSo, yes, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. Another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of coefficients from each polynomial whose exponents add up to that term. In this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), we're looking for the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, because any other term in the second polynomial would introduce a \\(c\\) term, which would make the product have \\(c\\) in it, thus not being just \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nTherefore, I think my reasoning is correct. The coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), which gives:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\) gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient of this term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from the two expansions:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

That would mean that \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient I found. Wait, actually, I think I might have misread the problem. It says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, maybe I need to consider the expansion of both parts together?\n\nWait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the rest of the terms involve \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, perhaps the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because they are separate variables. So, maybe the coefficient is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, the coefficient would just be 6 multiplied by whatever the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is.\n\nWait, but no, that doesn't make sense because each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would have different powers of \\(c\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, maybe the coefficient is just 6, because when you multiply by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by the sum of all the terms in that expansion, but since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, no, that can't be right. Because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient would actually be 6 times each coefficient in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since we're just asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps we need to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But actually, that might not be correct because each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a separate term, so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those, you're creating terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient is just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. Hmm, that seems conflicting.\n\nWait, maybe I need to approach this differently. Let me think. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand the product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) has a coefficient of 6, and it's multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. Is that correct?\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. Because if I set \\(c = 1\\), I get the sum of the coefficients, which is 64, but in reality, each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times each coefficient in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But actually, no, because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me verify this. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the product as \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out, so that the term is just \\(a^2b^2\\). That would make more sense. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the product.\n\nSo, let me rephrase: I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That would mean that in the expansion, I'm looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\).\n\nOkay, so that changes things. So, I need to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply those together.\n\nWait, no, more accurately, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the middle term's coefficient, because the exponents go from 6 down to -6 in steps of 2, I think.\n\nWait, actually, let's compute the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, when you multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, including the \\(c^0\\) term with coefficient 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut wait, the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), it just said the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I was overcomplicating it earlier. If the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then perhaps the coefficient is 6, because the rest of the terms involve \\(c\\), and the problem is only concerned with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). But that seems a bit odd because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that can't be, because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so I think the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which usually implies a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. So, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\n3. Multiply these coefficients together: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):** Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):** Using the binomial theorem, this is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients:** Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), we multiply the coefficients from each part: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), I can take that term (which is \\(6a^2b^2\\)) and multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not quite right because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, maybe I should think of the entire product as a product of two polynomials, and I'm looking for terms where the variables a and b are squared, but I don't care about the variables c and 1/c because they don't affect the a and b exponents. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the variables are different; c terms are separate from a and b. So maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but I'm not sure if that's the case. Wait, no, that's not correct because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is being multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so when I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's actually 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by every term in the second expansion, and each of those terms has a coefficient, so when you collect like terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but actually, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the second expansion is a term with c and 1/c, so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(6a^2b^2 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\), but the original question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms. Wait, but that can't be, because in the product, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second, so \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes various powers of c. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that multiplies \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by plugging in c = 1, right? Because when c = 1, each term becomes just its coefficient. So, let's compute \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which we found to be 6a^2b^2. Then, this term is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply 6a^2b^2 by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like 6a^2b^2c^6, 6a^2b^2c^5, etc., but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times a power of c, and when you multiply by 6a^2b^2, each of those becomes 6 times the coefficient times a^2b^2 times some power of c. So, when you collect like terms for a^2b^2, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. As we calculated earlier, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe I should think of the entire product as a product of two polynomials and consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial because each term in the second polynomial is a constant coefficient when considering the a and b variables. So, yes, that seems to make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this by considering that the variables c and 1/c are separate from a and b, so when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, again, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm by another method. Let's expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The expansion would be:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for k from 0 to 6. The sum of the coefficients is when c = 1, which gives us (1 + 1)^6 = 64, as before.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think if there's another way. Suppose I consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other polynomial \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't have a \\(a^2b^2\\) term, but it's being multiplied by each term in the first polynomial. So, when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those terms will have a coefficient, and when you collect all the terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times a power of c, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes that coefficient times \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of c. So, when you collect all the \\(a^2b^2\\) terms, their coefficients are all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that seems correct. I think I've convinced myself that the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by evaluating it at \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{384}\n\\]"

    "text": " So, maybe I can apply the binomial theorem to both parts of the given expression separately and then multiply the results together.\n\nLet me start by expanding \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this would be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\n\nI need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, right? So, \\(a^2b^2\\) would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) in the binomial expansion because when \\(k = 2\\), \\(4 - k = 2\\). So, the coefficient here would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Got that part down.\n\nNow, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but wait, this part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so how does that affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term? Hmm, maybe I need to consider the entire expansion and see if there's a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or involves \\(c^0\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms. So, if I can find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then when I multiply the two expansions together, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times that constant term.\n\nAlright, so let me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem as well:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nI need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that would be the constant term. So, I set the exponent equal to zero:\n\n\\[\n6 - 2m = 0 \\implies 2m = 6 \\implies m = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\). Let me compute that term:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{6 - 2*3} = \\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nBecause \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6*6} = 20\\).\n\nWait, hold on, that calculation doesn't seem right. Let me recalculate \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3! \\cdot 3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\cdot 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\n\\]\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original expression, which is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part).\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nWait a second, is that correct? Let me double-check my steps.\n\n1. Expanded \\((a + b)^4\\) and found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. That seems right because \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. Expanded \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and found the constant term by setting the exponent of \\(c\\) to zero, which occurs at \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). That also seems correct.\n\n3. Then, since the original expression is the product of these two expansions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (which is a term in the first expansion) and the constant term (which is a term in the second expansion) would multiply together, so 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit confused because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all the terms from the second expansion. So, wouldn't the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) be 6 multiplied by each term in the second expansion? But no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find the term in the second expansion that doesn't involve \\(c\\) (i.e., the constant term) so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would indeed be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product of two separate expansions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) comes from the second part. So, the coefficient is the product of these two coefficients. That seems to make sense.\n\nLet me try another approach to confirm. Let's consider the entire expansion:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nAnd,\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15\\dfrac{1}{c^2} + 6\\dfrac{1}{c^4} + \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\n\\]\n\nNow, when we multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, the only term in the second expansion that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is the constant term, which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 (from the first expansion) multiplied by 20 (from the second expansion), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the constant term. Let me re-expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem again.\n\nThe general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\cdot \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe set the exponent equal to zero: \\(6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\\).\n\nSo, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). That's correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other term that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by a term from the second expansion. For example, if there was a term like \\(a^3b\\) multiplied by a term involving \\(c^{-1}\\), but that would result in a term like \\(a^3b c^{-1}\\), which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\). Similarly, any term from the first expansion with a power other than \\(a^2b^2\\) would, when multiplied by a term from the second expansion, result in a term that includes \\(c\\) or another combination of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, only the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and the constant term from the second expansion contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but just to be extra sure, let me think about the structure of the product. The entire expression is:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\n\\]\n\nWhen you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which has a coefficient of 6, it gets multiplied by every term in the second expansion. However, only the constant term in the second expansion (which is 20) doesn't introduce any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factors. So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by 20, you get \\(20a^2b^2\\). All other terms from the second expansion would result in terms that have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so they don't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the final product. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning now. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem to expand each part separately and then combine the results.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\n\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nWe need the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero). Setting the exponent equal to zero:\n\n\\[\n6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n\\]\n\nThe constant term is:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from the two expansions:\n\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

The general term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. \n\nNow, I'm specifically looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the term where the exponent of \\(a\\) is 2 and the exponent of \\(b\\) is 2. That would happen when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so does that mean I need to consider both parts? Let me think. The expression is a product of two binomials: one involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). \n\nSince I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I should note that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), right? Because the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply them together, any term from the first part will be multiplied by any term from the second part. But since I'm looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't care about the \\(c\\) terms, because they won't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). \n\nWait, is that correct? Let me double-check. If I have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and then I multiply it by any term from the second part, say \\(c^k \\cdot (1/c)^{6 - k}\\), which simplifies to \\(c^{2k - 6}\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms will just tag along, but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second part multiplied by 6. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, its coefficient is 6, and when I multiply it by every term in the second part, each of those terms will have their own coefficients. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think I need to consider how many times \\(a^2b^2\\) appears when multiplied by different \\(c\\) terms. But wait, actually, \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), so each time \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a term from the second part, it's just adding another term with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. It says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the entire expression, so perhaps it's considering the entire expression, which includes both \\(a, b, c\\), but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second part multiplied by 6, because each term from the second part is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. \n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in a binomial expansion is found by setting the variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me think again. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) expands to terms with \\(a^4, a^3b, a^2b^2, ab^3, b^4\\), each with coefficients 1, 4, 6, 4, 1 respectively. Now, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which also expands to terms involving different powers of \\(c\\), each of these terms will be multiplied by each term from \\((a + b)^4\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each with their own coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is indeed found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this by another approach. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing their coefficients to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nAlternatively, if I were to write the product as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum over all m of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), because each term in the second sum contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). And since the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for m from 0 to 6 is \\(2^6 = 64\\), then the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, I think the coefficient is 384.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me try a different approach. Let me consider that in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6 in the first part, and when I multiply it by each term in the second part, each of those terms has a coefficient from the binomial expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 is indeed 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion? Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those terms contributes their coefficient to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times their respective power of \\(c\\). So, for example, \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^6\\) would have a coefficient of 6 * 1, \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^4\\) would have 6 * 6, and so on, but when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's actually the sum of all these contributions, which is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion. So, yes, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to collect all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, each such term would be \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\), where m ranges from 0 to 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in each of these terms is 6 times \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), and since we're considering all possible m, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from m=0 to m=6, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I'm not overcomplicating this. Let me try a smaller example to verify. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding \\((a + b)^2\\) gives \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c)^1\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\). The product would be \\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\). Now, looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\), which is just \\(a^2\\). So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the first expansion, which is 1, multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Let's check: the product is \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). The terms with \\(a^2\\) are \\(a^2c\\) and \\(a^2/c\\), each with coefficient 1, so the total coefficient is 2, which matches 1 * 2.\n\nSimilarly, if I look for the coefficient of \\(ab\\) in the same product, it's 2 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 2 * 2 = 4. Looking at the product, the terms with \\(ab\\) are \\(2abc\\) and \\(2ab/c\\), each with coefficient 2, so total coefficient is 4, which is correct.\n\nSo, this approach seems valid. Therefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure that I'm not missing something. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that appears in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each of those products will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nTherefore, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

Using the binomial theorem, this would be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\n\\]\n\nSo, the terms would be:\n\n- When \\(k = 0\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 = 1 \\times a^4 = a^4\\)\n- When \\(k = 1\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 = 4a^3b\\)\n- When \\(k = 2\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\)\n- When \\(k = 3\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 = 4ab^3\\)\n- When \\(k = 4\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4 = 1 \\times b^4 = b^4\\)\n\nSo, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). Now, I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6 in this part. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire expression, which is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how the terms from both expansions interact.\n\nWait, but hold on. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, right? So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find how many times \\(a^2b^2\\) appears in the product. But actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the terms multiply term by term, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), when I multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, that seems a bit complicated. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I can consider that since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply term by term. So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a^2b^2, and when you multiply it by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be correct because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems plausible.\n\nWait, but let me verify that. Let me think again: when you have two polynomials, say P(a, b) and Q(c), then the product P(a, b) * Q(c) will have terms where each term of P is multiplied by each term of Q. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) multiplied by the entire Q(c). But since Q(c) is a polynomial in c, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be 6 * Q(c), which is a polynomial in c. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would be a term that includes both a and b, but not c. Wait, no, the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which suggests that we're treating c as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in c. But that doesn't make much sense because the question is probably expecting a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial in c.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating c as a variable, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve c, the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in c, which seems odd because usually, when someone asks for the coefficient of a specific term, they're referring to the coefficient in the entire expanded expression, treating all variables as part of the term. So, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering the c terms, meaning that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of c. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which as I calculated earlier is 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 384. But let me check that again.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a^2b^2, and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when you multiply 6a^2b^2 by each of these terms, you get terms like 6\\dbinom{6}{k}a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum over all k of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), because each term contributes \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) as a coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of c, we need to sum all the coefficients for all powers of c. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for k from 0 to 6.\n\nBut wait, the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for k from 0 to 6 is \\(2^6 = 64\\), as I thought earlier. So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in each part. But no, that's not correct because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients don't just multiply; instead, each term in the first polynomial multiplies each term in the second, so the coefficients add up when the variables match. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve c, every term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as evaluating \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) at c = 1, which gives the sum of the coefficients, which is 64, and then multiplying by 6, giving 384. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me try a smaller example to see if this approach works. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding \\((a + b)^2\\) gives \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) is 1, \\(a^1b^1\\) is 2, and \\(a^0b^2\\) is 1. Now, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1 = c + 1/c\\). So, the product is \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in this product would be 1*(c + 1/c) = c + 1/c, so the coefficient is c + 1/c. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^1\\) is 2*(c + 1/c), and the coefficient of \\(a^0b^2\\) is 1*(c + 1/c). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) is indeed (1)*(c + 1/c), which is consistent with the approach of multiplying the coefficient from \\((a + b)^2\\) by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\).\n\nSo, applying the same logic to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the answer should be 384.\n\nWait, but let me check this another way. Alternatively, I can consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we saw earlier. Now, when we multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a separate polynomial, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms, the coefficient will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As before, the sum of the coefficients is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it: the entire expression is a product of two polynomials. The first is in variables a and b, and the second is in variables c and 1/c. So, when you multiply them, the terms are products of terms from each polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the product of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and any term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product being the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some k. But if we're only interested in terms where the exponent of c is zero, then we need the term where \\(c^k = c^0\\), i.e., \\(k=0\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, that's a different approach. Let me explore that. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the middle term when the exponent is zero. Let's compute that.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of c is zero, so 6 - 2k = 0 => 2k = 6 => k=3. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, if I were looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of c. So, that would include all terms where the exponent of c is any integer, not just zero. Therefore, that approach gives me only a part of the coefficient, specifically when c^0, but the problem is asking for all terms, so I need to sum over all k.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier conclusion. Hmm. Let me clarify: when the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it's considering the entire product as a polynomial in a, b, c, and 1/c. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of c, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in c. But that seems odd because usually, when someone asks for the coefficient of a term, they might be considering only the constant term or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in c. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. But that's different from my earlier approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which includes all powers of c. So, the coefficient would be a polynomial in c, where each term is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the corresponding term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in c. But that seems unlikely because the problem probably expects a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where a^2b^2 is multiplied by c^0. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the c terms, meaning that it's the sum of all coefficients where the term is \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any k. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think about it differently. If I set c = 1, then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 * 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this would be 6 * 64 = 384, which matches my earlier result. So, perhaps that's the correct approach.\n\nAlternatively, if I set c = 1, the expression simplifies, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) becomes 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the coefficient would be a polynomial in c, but perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient when considering c as part of the term, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve c, the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating c as a separate variable, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which is unlikely what the problem is asking for.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where a^2b^2 is multiplied by c^0. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120, as calculated earlier. But I'm not sure which interpretation is correct.\n\nWait, let me think again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms. Therefore, the coefficient would be a polynomial in c, where each term corresponds to the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. So, the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6*(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6c^6 + 36c^4 + 90c^2 + 120 + 90/c^2 + 36/c^4 + 6/c^6. But that seems too complicated, and the problem likely expects a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating c as a separate variable, but only considering the constant term in c. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of c^0 in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6*20=120. That seems plausible.\n\nWait, but to resolve this confusion, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials, one in a and b, and the other in c and 1/c. So, when you multiply them, the terms are of the form (terms in a and b) * (terms in c and 1/c). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in c. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient, and not the coefficient times a term, perhaps the answer is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but if I set c = 1, then the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 * 64\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6*64=384. Therefore, that seems to confirm that the answer is 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6*20=120, but given that when I set c=1, the coefficient becomes 384, I think that 384 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, let me do a small check. Let's compute \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) when a=1, b=1, c=1. Then, the expression becomes \\(2^4 \\times 2^6 = 16 \\times 64 = 1024\\). Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, so when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) evaluated at c=1, which is 64, we get 6*64=384. So, when a=1, b=1, c=1, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would contribute 384 to the total sum, which is correct because 384 is part of the total 1024. So, that seems to make sense.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would be 120, as calculated earlier. But in that case, when a=1, b=1, c=1, the term would contribute 120, which is a part of the total 1024. So, both interpretations are possible, but given that the problem is phrased as asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without specifying c, I think the correct approach is to consider the coefficient as 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64=384.\n\nTherefore, after going through this lengthy thought process, I believe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{384}\n\\]"

Using the binomial theorem, that would be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\n\nSo the terms would be:\n\n- When \\(k = 0\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 = 1 \\cdot a^4 = a^4\\)\n- When \\(k = 1\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 = 4a^3b\\)\n- When \\(k = 2\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\)\n- When \\(k = 3\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 = 4ab^3\\)\n- When \\(k = 4\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4 = 1 \\cdot b^4 = b^4\\)\n\nSo, in this expansion, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\).

So I can't just stop here; I need to consider the entire expression.\n\nI think I should first find the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as well, and then multiply it by \\((a + b)^4\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I can separate the parts of the expression that affect this term.\n\nWait, let me think. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\).

But wait, that can't be right because the entire expansion would contribute a lot of terms, but since we're looking for a specific term in the product, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me clarify: the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. However, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are only in the second part, the terms in the product will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and then we have to consider how that 6 is multiplied by each term in the other expansion. Wait, no, that's not correct because when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\).\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So perhaps the problem is considering the entire product as a single expression, and it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but we're just interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that when you multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe it's just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, but that doesn't make sense either because each term in the second expansion has different powers of \\(c\\), so they don't combine into a single coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So when you expand this product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and it gets multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would make the coefficient a number, which is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), so that would be \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So then the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, let me check that. If I set \\(c = 1\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), which is the sum of all the coefficients in that expansion. So, if I multiply each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term would be of the form \\(\\text{(term from first expansion)} \\times \\text{(term from second expansion)}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second part, which has terms like \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), perhaps it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, meaning that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that can't be because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me try another approach. Let me expand both expressions separately and then see how the terms combine.\n\nFirst, as before, \\((a + b)^4\\) has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\). Now, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nSo each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it just adds a coefficient multiplied by that term.\n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\), as I thought earlier. But let me check if that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So perhaps the correct interpretation is that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this by considering a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\n\\]\n\\[\n(c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\n\\]\nMultiplying them together:\n\\[\n(a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c) = a^2c + a^2/c + 2ab c + 2ab/c + b^2 c + b^2/c\n\\]\nNow, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in this product would be \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a sum of terms. But if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2\\), it would be \\(c + 1/c\\), which is not a number. But in our original problem, perhaps the coefficient is intended to be a number, so maybe the problem assumes that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you have two separate variables, \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), the terms in the product are combinations of both. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression in \\(c\\).\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is phrased incorrectly, or I'm misinterpreting it. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let's think about it another way. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. That seems to make sense because when \\(c = 1\\), all the \\(c\\) terms become 1, and the sum of coefficients is 64. So, perhaps the correct answer is 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to approach it differently. Let's consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient, and not the variable part, perhaps it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with another example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) would be \\(c + 1/c\\), which is not a number, but if I set \\(c = 1\\), then it becomes 2. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, which is the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion times the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first expansion, which is 1. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 * 2 = 2. Similarly, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in the example I just did, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is not a number, but if I set \\(c = 1\\), it becomes 2. So, perhaps the problem assumes that \\(c = 1\\), but that's not stated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be interpreted as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a specific power of \\(c\\), but since that's not specified, I think the correct interpretation is that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another thought: perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is 384, considering the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me compute the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As I mentioned earlier, setting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem is more straightforward. Let me consider that when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in one part is multiplied by the entire other expression. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and when you multiply it by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient becomes 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to be interpreted as finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct by looking at a simpler case. Let's say I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion is \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is not a number, but if I set \\(c = 1\\), it becomes 2. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2. Similarly, in our problem, if we set \\(c = 1\\), the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 2^6 = (a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, perhaps that's the intended approach.\n\nTherefore, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Let me go through the steps again:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n\n3. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, and since each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part (which is 64).\n\n4. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{384}\n\\]"

Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all different variables, they don't interfere with each other in terms of exponents.

So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and when I multiply it by any term from the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the variables won't combine with \\(a\\) or \\(b\\).

Hmm, that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, no, actually, since the two parts are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is a separate polynomial. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you have two separate polynomials multiplied together, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider how the terms interact. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first polynomial, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are only in the second, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product will come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by every possible term from the second part. But since the second part is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), each of those will just add a coefficient to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term when multiplied. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of all the coefficients in the second part.

But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not any term involving \\(c\\).

That seems too simplistic.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\).

Wait, no, the problem just says \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be the sum of all the coefficients from the second part multiplied by 6.\n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. In this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term from the second polynomial \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) to give a term with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), where \\(k\\) can be any even number from -6 to 6, perhaps. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply that it's considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, which doesn't make sense because each term would have different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), but that would mean summing over all possible \\(c\\) terms, which would give \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\), as I thought earlier.\n\nBut wait, let me check if that's the correct interpretation. The problem says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every possible term from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient would be the sum of all those products. That is, for each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\), when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum over all \\(k\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), which is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) from \\(k=0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\), so the total coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me confirm this approach. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, multiplied by the entire second part, so the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because coefficients are numerical, not expressions.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out to 0. That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would depend on the power of \\(c\\). So, if that's the case, then I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient for \\(c^0\\) in the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Then, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nBut the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), it just said \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the sum of all coefficients where the term has \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, which would be 120. I'm a bit confused now.\n\nWait, let me think about the structure of the problem. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\). So, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) come from the first part, and the exponents of \\(c\\) come from the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from \\(k = 2\\) in the first part, as we found earlier, giving a coefficient of 6. Then, when multiplied by any term from the second part, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\), the resulting term would be \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), because each term in the second part contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), which is \\(6 \\times 2^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\), since that's the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, I'm not sure which interpretation is correct.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for another approach. Let's consider that the entire expression is a product of two independent polynomials. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, the coefficient gets multiplied by each coefficient in the second polynomial. Therefore, the total coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). But since the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), I think the first approach is correct, so the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we have \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1 (from the first term) times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 2 (since \\(c + 1/c\\) has coefficients 1 and 1, sum is 2). So, the coefficient of \\(a^1\\) would be 1 * 2 = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) would be 1 * 2 = 2. But in reality, the terms are \\(ac\\), \\(a/c\\), \\(bc\\), \\(b/c\\), so the coefficients for \\(a\\) are 1 and 1, summing to 2, and same for \\(b\\). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^1\\) is indeed 2, which is 1 * 2. Therefore, applying this logic, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in the example, the coefficient of \\(a^1\\) is 2, which is the coefficient from the first part (which is 1 for \\(a^1b^0\\)) multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second part (which is 2). So, yes, that seems to confirm that the approach is correct. Therefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me check another example to be sure. Let's take \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). Expanding, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). Multiplying these together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be zero because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't appear in the product unless you multiply \\(ab\\) from the first part by \\(ab\\) from another part, but in this case, it's only up to \\(b^2\\). Wait, no, actually, in the product, each term is a combination of terms from each polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from multiplying \\(a^2\\) by \\(b^2\\), but since the first polynomial is only up to \\(b^2\\), but in the product, you'd have \\(a^2 \\times c^2\\), \\(a^2 \\times 2\\), \\(a^2 \\times 1/c^2\\), similarly for \\(2ab\\) and \\(b^2\\). So, actually, there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product, which suggests that my earlier approach might be flawed.\n\nWait, that's confusing. Let me compute the product explicitly. \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). \\((c + 1/c)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). Multiplying these together, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the product is:\n\n\\(a^2c^2 + a^2 \\times 2 + a^2 \\times 1/c^2 + 2ab \\times c^2 + 2ab \\times 2 + 2ab \\times 1/c^2 + b^2 \\times c^2 + b^2 \\times 2 + b^2 \\times 1/c^2\\).\n\nLooking at this, I don't see any term with \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero. But according to my earlier approach, the coefficient should be \\( \\dbinom{2}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{2} \\dbinom{2}{m} = 1 \\times (1 + 2 + 1) = 4\\). But in reality, the coefficient is zero. So, that suggests that my earlier approach is incorrect.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. So, perhaps my initial assumption that the coefficient is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of coefficients from the second part is wrong. Instead, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is zero because \\(a^2b^2\\) cannot be formed by multiplying terms from the two polynomials, as each polynomial only has one variable.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the two polynomials are \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the product will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents and \\(c\\) exponents. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by a term from the second part that has \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, making it \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is different from \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. That makes sense because only the term with \\(c^0\\) in the second part would result in a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without any \\(c\\) exponents. So, in the example I did earlier, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no \\(c^0\\) term in the second part except for the constant term 2. Wait, no, in the second part, \\((c + 1/c)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 2. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(\\dbinom{2}{2} \\times 2 = 1 \\times 2 = 2\\). But when I expanded the product earlier, I didn't see any \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Hmm, that's confusing.\n\nWait, let me check the expansion again. \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). \\((c + 1/c)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). Multiplying these together, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by multiplying \\(a^2\\) from the first polynomial by \\(b^2\\) from the second, but wait, no, the second polynomial doesn't have \\(b\\), it has \\(c\\). So, actually, you can't get \\(a^2b^2\\) because the second polynomial doesn't have \\(b\\). Wait, that's a mistake in my earlier reasoning. The second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\), not \\(b\\), so you can't get \\(b^2\\) from the second polynomial. Therefore, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial by a term from the second polynomial that has \\(c^0\\). But in the first polynomial, \\((a + b)^2\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present; the highest degree is \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\), but they are separate. So, in reality, \\(a^2b^2\\) can't be formed by multiplying any terms from the two polynomials because the second polynomial doesn't have \\(b\\), so the only way to get \\(b^2\\) is from the first polynomial, but then you can't get any \\(c\\) terms to combine with it. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is zero.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier calculation where I thought the coefficient would be 2. So, perhaps my initial approach was wrong. Therefore, going back to the original problem, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because you can't get \\(a^2b^2\\) from the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) because the second polynomial doesn't have \\(b\\). Therefore, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial by a term from the second polynomial that has \\(c^0\\), but since the second polynomial doesn't have \\(b\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can't be formed. Wait, no, that's not correct because the second polynomial is separate; it's multiplied by the first, but the variables are different. So, each term in the product will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents and \\(c\\) exponents. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only exist if there's a term in the product that has \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would require that the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., \\(k = 0\\).\n\nTherefore, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider the terms in the product where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. \n\nIn the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nIn the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). We set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies \\(c^0\\), the answer should be 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that in the example, the coefficient would be 2, but when I expanded, I didn't see \\(a^2b^2\\). But now I realize that in the example, the first polynomial is \\((a + b)^2\\), which doesn't have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, only \\(a^2\\), \\(2ab\\), and \\(b^2\\). Therefore, the product can't have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term unless the first polynomial has it. So, in the original problem, since the first polynomial \\((a + b)^4\\) does have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, the product will have \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), etc., depending on the second polynomial. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would require \\(c^0\\), so the answer is 120.\n\nTherefore, after this lengthy thought process, I believe the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the expansion of each part. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):** The term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):** The term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), giving \\(k = 3\\). Its coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{120}"

    "text": " So maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLet me start by expanding \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4. I'm specifically looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me calculate the coefficient for that term.\n\nThe coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). That means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient I just found. Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), maybe the coefficients involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think about that.\n\nActually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables from \\(c\\), the only way a term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is if it contributes a constant factor. Wait, but that's not the case because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are variables, so unless their exponents sum to zero, they won't be constants. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product of two separate expressions, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So when you multiply them, the variables are independent, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that can't be right because then it would be a polynomial in \\(c\\) as well. Wait, maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some term involving \\(c\\). But the problem statement doesn't specify any term involving \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is just 6, because when you multiply by the other expression, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion, but since we're only asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's just 6 times the entire expansion, which doesn't make sense because then it would be a polynomial. Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm supposed to treat the entire expression as a product, and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times whatever term in \\(c\\). But the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying any \\(c\\) term. So maybe the answer is just 6, because when you multiply by the other expression, it's like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\text{something}\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of the \\(c\\) part, which would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems odd because the question is asking for a single coefficient, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think differently. Perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) has exponent 0. Because if you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the only way to get a constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) is by taking terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out. So maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which would be the constant term in the \\(c\\) expansion.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), it just said \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm. Maybe I need to clarify. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So it's possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would result in a polynomial in \\(c\\), but that doesn't seem to make sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial, not a single number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would make sense. Let me proceed under that assumption, because otherwise the problem seems ambiguous. So, I'll assume that we need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the constant term in the \\(c\\) part.\n\nSo, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), we can consider the product of the coefficients from each expansion. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the middle term when the exponent is 6. Let me calculate that.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, so when you multiply the two expressions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem was just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would be a polynomial. But since the problem is asking for a single coefficient, it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient where the exponents of \\(c\\) also sum to zero, making it a constant term. So, I think the correct answer is 120.\n\nWait, let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, expanding \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero occurs at \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of the entire product and see how the terms combine. Each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. The only time \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient that's a constant (i.e., without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\)) is when it's multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\), is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any conditions on \\(c\\), then technically, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number, which doesn't make sense. So, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), in which case it's 6 multiplied by the entire expansion, but that seems unlikely because the question would probably specify if it wanted a term involving \\(c\\).\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it differently. Let me consider the entire product. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), and \\(1/c^6\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each of these, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., all the way down to \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120, because that's the only term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)). All other terms would have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) alone, without any \\(c\\) factors, is 120.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is found when \\(k = 2\\) in the expansion:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\).

So, the expansion would look like:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\n\\]\n\nCalculating the binomial coefficients:\n\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} = 1\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} = 1\\)\n\nSo, the expansion becomes:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nAlright, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. But wait, the problem isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the term \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nHmm, so the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since these are two separate binomials multiplied together, the expansion will involve multiplying each term from the first expansion by each term from the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can focus on the terms in the first part that contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) and then consider how the second part affects it.\n\nWait, actually, no. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since the variables in the second expression are \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the multiplication won't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, but since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients of the terms multiply, but since the variables are different, the exponents just add up. But in this case, the variables in the first part are \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and in the second part, they are \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables. So, when you multiply the two expressions, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since the variables are different, the exponents don't interfere. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct either. Let me clarify. Each term in the first expansion is a term with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and each term in the second expansion is a term with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the product will be a term with \\(a^k b^m c^n\\) or something like that. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Wait, that can't be right because the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which will introduce terms with \\(c\\). So, is the problem asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), or just the coefficient when considering all possible powers of \\(c\\)?\n\nWait, the problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, it's the sum of all coefficients where the term is \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part is multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is just a scalar coefficient multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). When you multiply it by the entire second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the result will be \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times\\) the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a single coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). So, maybe I misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the entire expansion, how many times does \\(a^2b^2\\) appear, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently.\n\nThe problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms in the product will have the form \\(a^k b^m c^n\\) or \\(a^k b^m c^{-n}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the product only when \\(k=2\\) and \\(m=2\\), regardless of the exponent on \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing to the coefficient.\n\nSo, as I thought earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this because sometimes when variables are involved, especially with negative exponents, the sum might not be straightforward. Let me calculate the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of the coefficients, we set \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), which is correct. So, yes, the sum is 64.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the product of the two expansions. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part because each term in the second part is multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing to the overall coefficient.\n\nWait, but actually, no. Let me think again. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6a^2b^2, and when multiplied by each term in the second part, which is, say, \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\), because \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to \\(\\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which has terms like \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes its own coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second expansion).\n\nAs calculated before, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I'm not making a mistake here. Is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion? Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those terms is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), so the result is \\(6 \\times \\text{(sum of coefficients)} \\times a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part being 6, and since the second part is multiplied by it, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me try another approach to confirm. Let's expand both parts separately and then see how they multiply.\n\nFirst, as before, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\nc^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficients are 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1 for the exponents 6, 4, 2, 0, -2, -4, -6 respectively.\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first will be multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in the first will be multiplied by each term in the second, resulting in:\n\n\\[\n6a^2b^2 \\times c^6 + 6a^2b^2 \\times 6c^4 + 6a^2b^2 \\times 15c^2 + 6a^2b^2 \\times 20 + 6a^2b^2 \\times 15/c^2 + 6a^2b^2 \\times 6/c^4 + 6a^2b^2 \\times 1/c^6\n\\]\n\nSo, each of these terms is of the form \\(6 \\times \\text{coefficient} \\times a^2b^2 \\times c^{\\text{something}}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all these coefficients because each term contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient is:\n\n\\[\n6 \\times (1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6 \\times 64 = 384\n\\]\n\nYes, that confirms it. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any miscalculations. Let me add up the coefficients in the second expansion again:\n\n1 (for c^6) + 6 (c^4) + 15 (c^2) + 20 (c^0) + 15 (c^-2) + 6 (c^-4) + 1 (c^-6) = 1 + 6 = 7; 7 +15=22; 22+20=42; 42+15=57; 57+6=63; 63+1=64. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the product of the two polynomials. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is 6, and the second polynomial has a sum of coefficients equal to 64, so when multiplied together, it's 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think I can confidently say that the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{384}\n\\]"

So, I have to consider the product of these two expansions. But wait, I'm only asked about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) because they won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Or do I? Hmm, maybe I need to think more carefully.\n\nWait, no. Actually, when multiplying two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term will come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, each term in the second part is something like \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), but when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any of these, the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), right? But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). That means I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, to clarify, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you just get \\(a^2b^2\\), and any other term would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) component, which we don't want.\n\nTherefore, I need to compute two things:\n\n1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found to be 6.\n2. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nOnce I have both coefficients, I can multiply them together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression.\n\nSo, let's tackle the second part: finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\).\n\nSimplifying each term: \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\):\n\n\\(6 - 2k = 0\\)\n\n\\(2k = 6\\)\n\n\\(k = 3\\)\n\nSo, the term where \\(k = 3\\) is the constant term. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nWait, let me check that again. 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720 divided by (6 times 6) is indeed 20. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients: 6 (from the first part) and 20 (from the second part). So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120.\n\nWait a second, let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes here. So, the first part gives me 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives me 20 for \\(c^0\\). So, when I multiply these together, I get 6 * 20 = 120. That should be the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression.\n\nLet me just think if there's another way to approach this problem. Alternatively, I could have expanded both expressions fully and then multiplied them, but that would be time-consuming and more prone to errors. Alternatively, I could have considered that since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a specific term, I only need to consider the parts of the expansion that contribute to it, which is exactly what I did.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem.\n2. Identify the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n3. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem.\n4. Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20.\n5. Multiply these two coefficients together to get 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0.

Using the binomial theorem, this would be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\n\nSo, the terms would be:\n\n- When \\(k=0\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} a^4 b^0 = 1 \\cdot a^4 \\cdot 1 = a^4\\)\n- When \\(k=1\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} a^3 b^1 = 4 \\cdot a^3 b\\)\n- When \\(k=2\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2 b^2 = 6 \\cdot a^2 b^2\\)\n- When \\(k=3\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} a^1 b^3 = 4 \\cdot a b^3\\)\n- When \\(k=4\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} a^0 b^4 = 1 \\cdot b^4\\)\n\nSo, the expansion is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). Got that part down. Now, I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. But wait, the problem isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I guess I need to consider the entire expression.\n\nLet me write the entire expression as:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\left(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\right) \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^5 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c} + 15c^4 \\cdot \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^2 + 20c^3 \\cdot \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^3 + 15c^2 \\cdot \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^4 + 6c \\cdot \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^5 + \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\right)\n\\]\n\nWait, that seems a bit complicated. Maybe I should expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem as well. Let me try that.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem on \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we get:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term in the expansion will be \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. Let me compute each term:\n\n- When \\(m=0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0} c^{6} = 1 \\cdot c^6\\)\n- When \\(m=1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1} c^{4} = 6 \\cdot c^4\\)\n- When \\(m=2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2} c^{2} = 15 \\cdot c^2\\)\n- When \\(m=3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20 \\cdot 1\\)\n- When \\(m=4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4} c^{-2} = 15 \\cdot c^{-2}\\)\n- When \\(m=5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5} c^{-4} = 6 \\cdot c^{-4}\\)\n- When \\(m=6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6} c^{-6} = 1 \\cdot c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\).\n\nNow, the original expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to multiply each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then collect the coefficients where the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts give \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nBut wait, actually, when I multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply and the exponents add. However, in this case, the two polynomials are in different variables: one is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other is in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the variables are independent, meaning that the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with the exponents of \\(c\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But since the other part of the product is in terms of \\(c\\), when you multiply, each term will have some power of \\(c\\) as well. So, unless the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which doesn't make much sense, or perhaps it's a typo and they meant \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the constant term with respect to \\(c\\).\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, perhaps it's considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\), and they just want the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a sum of terms in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe it's actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a constant, not depending on \\(c\\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient when considering all the terms, so perhaps the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), which would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the other expansion.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, it's a bit ambiguous, but I think they mean the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would imply that the coefficient is a sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms, which doesn't make much sense because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe they mean the coefficient when considering the entire expression as a product, but that would just be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times that expansion.\n\nWait, but that seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would require considering the product of the two expansions. But in that case, each term in the product would be of the form \\(a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to find all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, which corresponds to \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k=2\\), which gives the coefficient 6 from \\((a + b)^4\\). Then, when we multiply by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each of those terms will have a coefficient, so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a single coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). That makes more sense.\n\nSo, if I assume that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then multiply those two coefficients together.\n\nFrom earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the middle term when \\(m=3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me go through it again.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\) has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\). Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a term \\(20c^0\\). So, when you multiply these two, the term \\(6a^2b^2 * 20c^0 = 120a^2b^2c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a single coefficient.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct interpretation is that they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using generating functions or considering the product more carefully.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that when multiplying two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a single coefficient.\n\nTherefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), so the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). Therefore, the answer is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. The problem is in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be a sum of terms involving different powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is ambiguous. It could mean the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion, or it could mean the coefficient when \\(c^0\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nGiven that, I think the intended answer is 120, assuming they want the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). So, I'll go with that.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me compute the entire coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, that would be:\n\n6 * (c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6})\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6c^6 + 36c^4 + 90c^2 + 120 + 90c^{-2} + 36c^{-4} + 6c^{-6}.\n\nBut that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense as a single coefficient. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient when considering \\(c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)), which is 20.\n3. Multiply these coefficients together: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{120}"
