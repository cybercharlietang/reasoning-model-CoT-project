    "text": " So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLet me focus on the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so \\(a^2b^2\\). Using the binomial theorem, each term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, I need \\(4 - k = 2\\) for the exponent of \\(a\\) and \\(k = 2\\) for the exponent of \\(b\\). That means \\(k = 2\\).\n\nCalculating the binomial coefficient, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't affect the powers of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 multiplied by whatever the constant term is in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\n\nWait, no, that might not be right. Let me think again. The entire expression is a product of two expansions: one in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms in each expansion are independent. So, when you multiply them together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion.\n\nBut the question is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means we're looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\). So, in the product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not about any specific power of \\(c\\), does that mean we're just considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of the second part?\n\nWait, no, I think I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every possible term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, that doesn't sound right either. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first polynomial, and when multiplied by the entire second polynomial, it will produce terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), etc. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not any specific power of \\(c\\). So, maybe the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present once, multiplied by the constant term (if any) from the second polynomial.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, if I consider the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will only appear if there's a term in the second polynomial that's a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), because then \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1\\) would just be \\(a^2b^2\\). If the second polynomial doesn't have a constant term, then \\(a^2b^2\\) would not appear in the product. So, I need to check if \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a constant term.\n\nLet me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero for the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\).\n\nSo, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there another way this could happen? Like, could there be other terms in the second polynomial that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), give another term with \\(a^2b^2\\)? But no, because the second polynomial only has powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is if you multiply by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)). So, yes, the coefficient should be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and coefficients from the second polynomial for each term. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) is when the second polynomial contributes a constant term, which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives 6. The expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a constant term of 20. Multiplying these together gives the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product as \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLet me start with the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this would expand to the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I'm specifically looking for the term where the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to find the value of \\(k\\) such that \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\) and \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). Solving \\(4 - k = 2\\) gives \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part of the expression: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. Expanding this would give \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is part of the product of the two expansions. So, actually, I need to consider how the two parts multiply together. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so when I multiply them, each term from the first expansion will multiply each term from the second expansion.\n\nHowever, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with those involving \\(c\\). That means when I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can treat the \\(c\\) part as a separate factor that will just multiply the coefficient from the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) part.\n\nWait, but hold on. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", but in the entire expression, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). So, does that mean the coefficient is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is from the second part? Or is there more to it?\n\nHmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first expansion, right? So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term in the product, and when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial multiplies each term from the second. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those will contribute to the overall coefficient.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right either. Let me clarify. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\). Wait, that might not be the case because \\(c\\) is in the second factor, so when you multiply, the terms will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) parts.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nWait, that makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, each term will have a coefficient, and all those will add up to give the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second part.\n\nBut let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just considering the coefficient in the entire product, so it's 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would involve \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps I need to find the term where in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a term in the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\).\n\nYes, that must be it. Because otherwise, the coefficient would have \\(c\\) in it, but the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. So, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, that means I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, then multiply them together.\n\nThat makes more sense. So, let me adjust my approach. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Once I have that, I can multiply the two coefficients together to get the final answer.\n\nSo, let's work on the second part: finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that's not correct because 6! is 720, but 3! is 6, so 6!/(3!3!) is 720/(6*6) which is 720/36 = 20. Hmm, yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. So, in the first expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when I multiply these two, I get 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part and is multiplied by each term in the second part, but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms from the second expansion multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire second polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number. So, I think my initial approach was correct, that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me think again. Suppose I expand both parts:\n\nFirst part: \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nSecond part: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will multiply each term in the second part. So, the terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be:\n\n\\(6a^2b^2c^6 + 6a^2b^2c^4 + 6a^2b^2c^2 + 6a^2b^2 \\times 20 + 6a^2b^2 \\times 15/c^2 + 6a^2b^2 \\times 6/c^4 + 6a^2b^2 \\times 1/c^6\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6, \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 6, \\(a^2b^2c^2\\) is 6, \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120, \\(a^2b^2/c^2\\) is 90, \\(a^2b^2/c^4\\) is 36, and \\(a^2b^2/c^6\\) is 6.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the product is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That term is \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. For the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), which is correct.\n\nFor the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), which is correct.\n\nSo, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

So, I think I just need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2 in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me write that down. The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will have terms like \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\). So, when \\(k = 2\\), the term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^{2}b^{2}\\). Let me compute that binomial coefficient: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Let me think again. The expression is a product of two separate binomial expansions. So, when I multiply them together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part. But since the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if we multiply it by a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), which would be the constant term in the second expansion. Because if we multiply by a term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), then the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2(1/c)^k\\), which are not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the constant term in the second part.\n\nWait, that makes sense because when you multiply two polynomials, the constant term in one comes from the product of the constant terms, and the cross terms involve other variables. So, in this case, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and multiply it by 1 (the constant term) from the second expansion, because any other term would introduce \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which we don't want.\n\nSo, now I just need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me use the binomial theorem again for this. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the constant term in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from both parts, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me just double-check that I didn't make a mistake. So, in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in the second part, the constant term is 20. So, when you multiply these two, you get 120.

So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. Let me recall, the general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, if I set \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\). That means the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2\\).

Because the entire expression is a product, the coefficients multiply as well. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will contribute a factor that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\).

Wait, that doesn't seem right either.\n\nHold on, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply term by term. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since the \\(c\\) terms are separate, they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, no, that's not correct because the entire expression is a product, so when you multiply the two expansions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's actually the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, that might make sense. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term will have a coefficient, and all those coefficients add up when you collect like terms. But actually, no, that's not quite right. Because each term in the product will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. But the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes a coefficient, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each of those, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible \\(c\\) terms is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Let me test this with a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Let's see: \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c. The terms with \\(a\\) are \\(a c\\) and \\(a/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a variable expression, not a constant. Wait, but in this case, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term with specific exponents, but in reality, when you multiply, the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) will vary. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they contribute to the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible \\(c\\) terms.\n\nWait, but in the example I just did, the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be \\(c + 1/c\\), which is not a constant. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But in reality, when you expand the product, each term will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), each with their own coefficients. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes a coefficient, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each of those, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible \\(c\\) terms is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but in the example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion. Let me check that. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. If I have \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of its coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Is that correct?\n\nWait, but let me think again. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64 when \\(c = 1\\). So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\), the second part becomes 64, and the first part becomes \\((1 + 1)^4 = 16\\). So, the total expression when \\(c = 1\\) is 16 * 64 = 1024. But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384, which is part of that total. So, that seems to make sense.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm this approach. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part because each term in the second part is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, that would give the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\).\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first polynomial, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are only in the second, the terms are independent. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part.\n\nSo, to calculate this, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we've already determined is 6. Next, find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial, you can substitute \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64.\n\nNow, multiplying the two results together: 6 (from the first part) times 64 (from the second part) equals 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to approach this is to consider that the entire expression is a product of two independent expansions. So, when you multiply them, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which has a coefficient. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient from the first expansion (6) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion (64), giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to expand both parts fully, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6, and each of those would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, each contributing their own coefficient. So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, hence 384.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together, we get \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion will have terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\).\n\nSince I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I should figure out which term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) has \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me write out the general term: it's \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I want \\(a^2b^2\\), so I need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, substituting \\(k = 2\\), the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the problem is that this term is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, does that mean the coefficient is just 6 multiplied by whatever the coefficient is for the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that doesn't involve \\(c\\)? Because if I'm only considering \\(a^2b^2\\), then any terms involving \\(c\\) would contribute to other variables, but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe we just need to consider the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but actually, when multiplying two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. However, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if it's multiplied by 1 (the multiplicative identity) in the second part. But \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't have a constant term unless we consider the middle term where the exponents cancel out.\n\nWait, let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand this, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we don't care about the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's actually just the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that doesn't sound right.\n\nWait, no. Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each factor. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first factor, and the second factor doesn't affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be, because the entire expansion would include many terms with different powers of \\(c\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that coefficient is just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a single number, not an expression involving \\(c\\).\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. It says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the entire expression. So, does that mean we're treating \\(c\\) as another variable, and we're looking for the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\)? Or are we supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so that the coefficient would be an expression in terms of \\(c\\)? But the problem just asks for the coefficient, so maybe it's just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times \\(2^6\\) because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has coefficients that sum up when you set \\(c = 1\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), so the sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems too high. Let me check again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Then, when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which means that in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nBut wait, let me think differently. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the rest of the variables are \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. But the problem asks for the coefficient, which should be a number, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but we're just focusing on the part with \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nBut let me verify this another way. Let's consider that \\((a + b)^4\\) has the term \\(6a^2b^2\\). Then, when we multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the entire expression is \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but another thought: maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. In that case, we would need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). Setting \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, now I'm confused. So, depending on how the problem is interpreted, the answer could be either 384 or 120. But the problem says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's just 384, as that's the coefficient when considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 384. However, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying anything about \\(c\\). That suggests that we're considering all possible terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient will be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're just looking for the coefficient, and not the entire expression, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. But the problem doesn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I think it's 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should check both interpretations.\n\nFirst, if we're considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 384. If we're considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120. Since the problem doesn't specify \\(c\\), I think the first interpretation is correct, so the answer is 384.\n\nBut wait, another angle: in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent. So, when we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's equivalent to saying the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a numerical value, not a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem just asks for the coefficient, not a polynomial.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think I need to clarify this. Let me see. In the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which has various powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. But since the second expansion is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is usually a number unless specified otherwise. So, perhaps the problem is miswritten, or I'm misinterpreting it.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem just asks for the coefficient, not a polynomial. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when all the \\(c\\) terms are considered, but that would still be a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems odd because the coefficient should be a number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. In that case, we need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I'm not sure. Maybe I should look at similar problems or think about how coefficients work in products. When you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. But in this case, the desired term is \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiply it by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nThat makes sense because if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we're considering the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, but we're not restricting the exponent of \\(c\\). However, in the product, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, each of which has some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all those products, which is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. But the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut now I'm back to the same confusion. So, which is it? Is the coefficient 384 or 120? Let me think about it differently. If the problem had been \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then it would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But since the problem doesn't specify \\(k\\), it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible \\(c^k\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a single number.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is usually a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, so 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written in such a way that it's actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but that seems unlikely because the problem just asks for the coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is in two variables, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) is a separate variable, so when we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so that can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is actually \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we're supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. But since the problem doesn't specify \\(c^0\\), I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let me think about the structure of the expression. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these out, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which has various powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^{10}\\) or something like that, but as it is, it's \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me think about it in terms of generating functions. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum over all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if we're considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 6 times the constant term in the second polynomial, which is 20, so 120.\n\nBut the problem is written as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying \\(c\\), so I think it's the first interpretation, 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion would be \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) is also \\(c + 1/c\\). But if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in that product, it would be \\(c + 1/c\\), not a number. So, in that case, the coefficient is a polynomial.\n\nTherefore, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should go back to the problem statement. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), specifically 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in two variables, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) is a parameter, so we're supposed to treat \\(c\\) as a constant. In that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But again, the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when the entire expression is expanded, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut I'm still not entirely sure. Let me think about it another way. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms involving \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). Each of these is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps the problem is miswritten.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem just asks for the coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when the entire expression is considered as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But again, the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but considering that \\(c\\) is another variable, so the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But I think the problem is expecting a numerical answer, so perhaps the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me calculate both possibilities:\n\n1. Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\): 6 * 64 = 384.\n\n2. Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\): 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nGiven that the problem doesn't specify \\(c\\), I think the first interpretation is correct, so the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with another approach. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If we set \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), and \\(c = 1\\), then the value of the expression would be \\((1 + 1)^4 \\times (1 + 1)^6 = 16 \\times 64 = 1024\\). On the other hand, if we set \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), and \\(c = 1\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by 1, and the sum of all coefficients would be 1024. But that's not directly helpful.\n\nAlternatively, if we set \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), and \\(c = 1\\), the sum of all coefficients in the product is \\((1 + 1)^4 \\times (1 + 1)^6 = 16 \\times 64 = 1024\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384, which is less than 1024, so that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if we set \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), and \\(c = 1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 384, as calculated earlier.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, since this term is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

Using the binomial theorem, this should expand to:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the coefficients, that becomes:\n\n\\[\n1 \\cdot a^4 + 4 \\cdot a^3b + 6 \\cdot a^2b^2 + 4 \\cdot ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6. Okay, that's straightforward.\n\nNow, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think that means I need to consider the entire product. But wait, the \\(c\\) terms are separate from the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, right? So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the variables involved are different. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. However, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the part with \\(c\\) just gets multiplied as a whole.\n\nWait, let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6 \\(a^2b^2\\), and then it's multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply by each term, each term contributes differently. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), because the other part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient would just be 6. But that seems too simple. Let me check.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), each multiplication by a term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would add a coefficient multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but that's not correct either because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you're actually creating terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find the terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., \\(c^0 = 1\\), because only those terms will contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nOkay, that makes more sense. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me compute that.\n\nAgain, using the binomial theorem for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying the exponents, that's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\) so \\(k = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20.\n\nSo, going back, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me confirm that. So, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(c^0\\) is when \\(k = 3\\), so that's \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{6 - 3} \\times (1/c)^3 = \\dbinom{6}{3} c^{3} \\times c^{-3} = \\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\\). So, yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) (which has a coefficient of 6) by this 20, we get 120 as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, but only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero will contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term without any \\(c\\) involved. So, that term is \\(a^2b^2 \\times 20\\), giving a coefficient of 120. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of the entire expression as a product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120, and since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the same as \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that's the coefficient we're looking for.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the final coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Let me write down the general term in the expansion: \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the expression also has \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). That's confusing. Let me think. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) is in the second part, maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Or do they? Hmm, no, actually, when you multiply the two expressions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, maybe the coefficient is just the coefficient from the first part, and the second part doesn't contribute anything? Wait, that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me clarify: the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first expansion, when multiplied by any term from the second expansion, it would result in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That implies that we are looking for the coefficient when \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, right? Because if we multiply by a term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), then the term would have \\(c\\) in it, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nSo, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because that's the only term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it will give a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let's calculate that.\n\nAgain, using the binomial theorem for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient from the second expansion for the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20, when we multiply these two expressions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the product of these two coefficients. So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. When we multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But only the term with \\(c^0\\) will result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms will have some power of \\(c\\), so they won't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nSo, I think that's the answer. But just to make sure I didn't make a mistake, let me go through it again.

So, when you multiply these two expressions together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. That would make sense because then we're looking for a specific term in the entire expansion where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) have exponents 2 each, and \\(c\\) has exponent 0. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product.\n\nIf that's the case, then I need to compute the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply the two terms together, the exponents add up, so to get \\(c^0\\), I need to take the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel each other out.\n\nSo, first, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well.\n\nThe expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(k = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, so multiplying them gives 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the entire product. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives terms with different powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. So, that must mean that the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). Therefore, the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Let me think of the entire expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it's multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean that the coefficient is a function of \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\), which is 20, so the total coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems unlikely because it's not a number. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me consider another angle. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's not a number, it's a polynomial. So, that can't be right. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), so the answer is 120.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, if I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all possible products where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in the first polynomial are 2 each, and the exponents of \\(c\\) in the second polynomial are such that when multiplied, the total exponent of \\(c\\) is whatever. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying \\(c\\), which is confusing. So, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is intended to have you consider that the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, but that's not the case because the entire product is a product of polynomials, so each term is a combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) terms.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to see if there's another approach. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense as a coefficient. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, without considering \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a function of \\(c\\), which isn't a number, so that can't be right. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nSo, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nI think that's the correct approach. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2 is when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nIn this case, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me write that out using the binomial theorem. So, \\((a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2 because the problem is asking for \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need the term where \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\) and \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). So, solving \\(4 - k = 2\\) gives \\(k = 2\\). \n\nNow, the coefficient for this term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nBut wait, the problem isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how that affects the coefficient. Hmm, I think I need to consider the entire product and find the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expanded form. \n\nLet me think: when I multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, in this case, every term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I should check if the second expression affects the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. \n\nWait a minute, the second expression is in terms of \\(c\\), so when I multiply it by \\((a + b)^4\\), the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms won't be affected by the \\(c\\) terms. That means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression should just be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But actually, no, that's not quite right because the entire product would have terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me clarify: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you're effectively scaling the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by each of those coefficients. \n\nBut wait, no, that's not correct either. Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a separate term, so when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think the coefficient remains 6 because the \\(c\\) terms don't influence the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. \n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the product will have a corresponding power of \\(c\\), but the \\(a^2b^2\\) term itself isn't multiplied by a constant; it's multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, no, that's not right either. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when you multiply it by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), and so on. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think it's just 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the product is a separate term. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would give terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself is just 6 times each coefficient in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), right? Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again: when you have two separate polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, in this case, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it becomes 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, but that doesn't make sense because coefficients are constants. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to treat the entire expression as a product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the problem is considering the entire product as a single expression and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the sum of coefficients is 64, as calculated earlier, then 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 384. \n\nBut wait, let me verify this. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest is part of the other variables, but that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire product, which includes the \\(c\\) terms. \n\nWait, no, the problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so it's possible that regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient is just 6. But that seems contradictory because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is scaled by each term in the other expansion. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial, not a constant. \n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a constant, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me try to approach it differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), meaning that we sum over all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by each term in the other polynomial. So, in this case, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial is 6, and when multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, it becomes 6 times each term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are constants. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think of it as combining the two expansions. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and then it's multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As calculated before, the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut let me check this again. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6. But that seems too simplistic because the entire expression is a product, and the \\(c\\) terms would affect the overall coefficient. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a single polynomial, and it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the answer is simply 6 because the \\(c\\) terms don't influence the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply by a polynomial, each term is scaled by each term in the other polynomial. \n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as the product of two polynomials, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of the products of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and each term in the second polynomial. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first polynomial, when multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire second polynomial, which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial, not a constant. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, let me confirm this. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, multiplying this by 6 gives 384. \n\nBut let me think again: if I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when I multiply them, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times each term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire second polynomial, which is 6 * \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a constant. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), meaning that we need to sum over all possible coefficients. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this, and the answer is simply 6 because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. But that seems incorrect because when you multiply by a polynomial, each term is scaled by each term in the other polynomial. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by other variables. But that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product, and the coefficients are combined. \n\nWait, let me think of it this way: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, in this case, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it becomes 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a constant, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial. But that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical answer. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is just part of the expression, so the coefficient remains 6. But that seems too simple, and I think the presence of the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) term suggests that the coefficient is affected. \n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which includes all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product as a single term, and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would indeed be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because coefficients are constants. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think differently. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it becomes 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, but the problem is asking for the coefficient, so perhaps it's expecting just the constant term. \n\nWait, but that would mean I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). To find the constant term, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, that makes sense. Because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), only the constant term would result in a term that doesn't have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nBut the problem didn't specify that it's looking for the constant term; it just asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the answer is 120. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought it might be 384, but that was under the assumption that we're summing all coefficients, which would give the total coefficient when \\(c = 1\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion, which would be a polynomial. But since the problem is asking for a coefficient, perhaps it's expecting a constant, so maybe it's 120. \n\nWait, let me clarify: when the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", it's referring to the coefficient in the entire product. So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. Therefore, the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a constant, so perhaps it's expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean summing over all coefficients in the second polynomial. As calculated earlier, that sum is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient is 384, which is a constant. Alternatively, if the problem is considering the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are constants. \n\nI think I'm getting confused here. Let me try to approach it differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nSince \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a constant, so perhaps it's expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), meaning the term is \\(a^2b^2\\) times a constant, then we need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify whether it's looking for the coefficient with or without considering \\(c\\). Hmm. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so perhaps it's considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is just part of the expression. But that seems too simplistic, and I think the presence of the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) term suggests that the coefficient is affected. \n\nWait, another approach: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, in this case, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it becomes 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). \n\nBut since the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a constant, I think the intended answer is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think I need to decide which interpretation is correct. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", and since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), I think the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), making the coefficient a polynomial. But since the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a constant, perhaps it's expecting the coefficient when considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, resulting in 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is considering the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But since the problem is asking for a coefficient, I think it's expecting a constant, so perhaps the intended answer is 384. \n\nWait, let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a constant. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the product as a whole, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is just part of the expression, so the coefficient remains 6. But that seems too simple, and I think the problem is expecting a more involved answer considering both parts. \n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a constant, perhaps it's expecting the coefficient when \\(c\\) is set to 1, which would make the second polynomial equal to 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nI think that's the most plausible answer. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the two coefficients:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), right? So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. That means the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\).\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since the two parts of the expression are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). That makes me think that maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait a second, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the product, but the entire expression also includes terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). However, since the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), I think I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, and that's it. Because when you multiply by the other part, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. Because if you have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when you expand the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms from the other expansion multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is just multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\).\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), meaning that it's just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Alternatively, maybe I need to consider that the entire expression is a product, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part's terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. So, the coefficient remains 6.\n\nWait, that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) and I multiply it by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each of these, you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would require that the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) is when the second part contributes a constant term, i.e., when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.\n\nSo, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me calculate that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). Therefore, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that's \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, so earlier I thought it was just 6, but now I'm getting 120. Which one is correct? Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is \\(6a^2b^2\\). When you multiply this by the entire second expansion, each term in the second expansion will be multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the coefficient when the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, meaning only the constant term in the second expansion contributes to this. So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the constant term. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Setting \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), which is correct.\n\nAnd the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), which is also correct. So, multiplying them together gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Let me try another approach. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, when I multiply the two expansions together, the only way to get a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is if the term from the second expansion is a constant, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because when I multiply it by \\(a^2b^2\\), it will still be \\(a^2b^2\\), and the coefficient will be the product of the two coefficients. \n\nSo, first, I'll find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I calculated earlier. Then, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nLet me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). I need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so I set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). \n\nSo, the term where \\(k = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0}\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).

Wait, no, that can't be right because when you multiply, you have to consider all the terms.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), ..., down to \\(c^{-6}\\). So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each of these \\(c\\) terms, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) or anything else. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms\u2014it only affects the \\(c\\) terms. So, does that mean the coefficient is just 6?\n\nWait, but that seems too simple. Let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be the product of the coefficients from each part, but only if the terms are multiplied together in a way that the exponents add up correctly. But no, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first part, and the second part is entirely in terms of \\(c\\), so when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion would contribute a factor to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, that might make sense. Let me think about it. So, if I have \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the entire product would have terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so it's just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Is that correct?\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and it's multiplied by the entire second expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, which is indeed 64. So, 6 times 64 is 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But that can't be right because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. So, if the second expansion has a sum of coefficients equal to 64, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is intended to have the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some specific \\(c\\) term, but I don't think so because it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\).\n\nWait, but let me think differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me check with a small example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion would be \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 1 times (c + 1/c), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be c + 1/c, but that's not a numerical coefficient. Hmm, so maybe in that case, the coefficient isn't just the product of the coefficients, but rather, each term is multiplied. So, perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times each term in the second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a single coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms. But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) is to the power of 0, which is 1. So, in that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. That would make sense too.\n\nLet me check that approach. So, if I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is \\(a^2b^2\\), then I would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is the middle term of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. Each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but now I'm confused because earlier I thought it was 384, and now I'm getting 120. Which one is correct?\n\nLet me clarify the problem statement again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{6 - 2m}\\) where \\(k\\) and \\(m\\) are integers. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would appear in the product as \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) for various \\(m\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms where the exponent of \\(a\\) is 2 and \\(b\\) is 2, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, that seems to contradict the other approach where I considered \\(c^0\\). So, which is it?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the coefficient. But that can't be right because when you multiply, each term is multiplied by each term in the other expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nBut earlier, when I considered \\(c^0\\), I got 120. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, let me think again. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), meaning that it's the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), so the coefficient is 120. But I'm not sure which interpretation is correct.\n\nWait, let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, let me think about how the multiplication works. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion because each term in the second expansion contributes a factor to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is indeed \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that the \\(c\\) terms must cancel out. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. But since the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion is \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) would be \\(c + 1/c\\), and the coefficient of \\(b\\) would also be \\(c + 1/c\\). But if I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then it's \\(c + 1/c\\), which is not a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient as a numerical value, which would require considering only the constant term in \\(c\\).\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be a numerical coefficient. So, in that case, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I'm not sure. Maybe I should look for both interpretations.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 384.\n\nAlternatively, if it's intended to have \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120.\n\nI think I need to clarify this. Let me consider the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, in the example I did earlier, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is not a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which would be a numerical coefficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the \\(c\\) terms are considered as separate variables, and the coefficient is just 6.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term is multiplied by each term in the other expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as a generating function. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum over all possible \\(k\\) of (coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part) times (coefficient of \\(c^{...}\\) in the second part). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is fixed, the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120.\n\nI think I need to decide which interpretation is correct. Since the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nBut let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't mention \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because when I think of the coefficient of a term in a product of polynomials, it's usually considering all possible combinations. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. But without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Let's expand both parts separately and see how it works.\n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\). As I did before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nNext, expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all these coefficients. Since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nThe sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, that makes sense because when you set \\(c = 1\\), you're effectively summing all the coefficients in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120. But since it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), I think 384 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then the product is a polynomial where each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{6 - 2m}\\), where \\(k\\) and \\(m\\) are integers. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would appear in the product as \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) for various \\(m\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum over all \\(m\\) of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nYes, I think that's correct. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit unsure because in some contexts, the coefficient of a term in a product would consider only the terms where the variables multiply to give that term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first polynomial and the second polynomial is in \\(c\\), the variables don't interfere. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384.\n\nTherefore, I think the final answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm with another approach. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by the entire second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But the expansion of the second part has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we're essentially summing all the coefficients from the second part because each term in the second part contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Each term in this expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).

    "text": " So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLet me start by looking at the first part of the expression, which is \\((a + b)^4\\). If I expand this using the binomial theorem, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. I'm specifically interested in the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\) and \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). So, solving \\(4 - k = 2\\) gives \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). That part seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since multiplication is distributive over addition, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, I'm only asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to consider how the other parts of the expression affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), since those are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient remains the same as in the first part.\n\nWait, hold on, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The entire expression is a product of two separate binomial expansions. So, when I multiply them together, the terms from each expansion will combine. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first part, and the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. However, when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I'm only concerned with the coefficient, regardless of the other variables. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient remains 6.\n\nWait, that seems too simple. Let me double-check. So, the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I expand both, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, for example, \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by \\(c^6\\) from the second part, giving \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), and so on. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, all the terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) (positive or negative) will have the same coefficient, which is 6. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient being the product of the coefficients from each part. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and the second part doesn't contribute to \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient remains 6. So, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me consider another approach. Let's say I expand both parts separately and then look at the product. The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will give terms involving \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). Now, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first will multiply each term from the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will multiply each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(120a^2b^2\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), and \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). \n\nSo, all these terms have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, but actually, no, that's not correct. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire expression, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself isn't present unless multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, the term \\(120a^2b^2\\) comes from multiplying \\(6a^2b^2\\) by \\(20\\) from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, now I'm confused. Earlier I thought it was 6, but now I'm getting 120. Which is correct?\n\nLet me clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will only appear when multiplied by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second expansion. Because if you have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^k\\), that term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is different from \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is when \\(k=0\\), which is the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nSo, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when we multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion (which is 6) by the constant term from the second expansion (which is 20), we get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, so earlier I thought it was 6, but that was incorrect because I didn't consider that the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only present when multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion. So, the correct coefficient is 120.\n\nLet me verify this again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. The term \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) comes from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20. When you multiply these two terms together, you get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) for the term \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms would have additional factors of \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), so they wouldn't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) alone.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is indeed 120. I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)** using the binomial theorem. The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\).\n\n2. **Find the constant term** in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which happens at \\(k = 3\\). The constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients**: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " So, in this case, for \\((a + b)^4\\), I can write it as the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\).\n\nNow, I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That means I need \\(a^2b^2\\), so in the expansion, I need the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. Let me think about how that term would look. Since \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\), I want \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, solving for \\(k\\), \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for that term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. But wait, the original problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I also have this other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Do I need to consider that as well?\n\nHmm, the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). I think that means just the coefficient from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables. So, maybe the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me check that.\n\nWait, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and multiply them by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\). But since the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the product, but the other part has \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe the question is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, that's confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, you'll have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m \\times (1/c)^{6 - m}\\), right? But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that would be the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a part of the product.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second polynomial, it will just be \\(a^2b^2\\) times that term, but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. If I have two polynomials, P and Q, then the coefficient of a specific term in P times Q is the coefficient of that term in P times the sum of all coefficients in Q. Because when you multiply each term in P by each term in Q, the specific term in P will be multiplied by every term in Q, so the coefficient for that specific term in the product will be the product of its coefficient in P times the sum of coefficients in Q.\n\nWait, but that's only if the term you're looking for in P doesn't involve variables from Q. So, in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from Q, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the resulting term will be \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P times the sum of all coefficients in Q.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the sum of all coefficients in Q is when you set \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) be 6 times 64? That would be 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is just 6, and the \\(c\\) terms are separate. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, the expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables are separate. So, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first polynomial, and the second polynomial is in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second polynomial contributes to multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term in \\(c\\).\n\nBut wait, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), so that would be \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part is just part of the overall expression, but since it's multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would be 6 times whatever the coefficient is in the other part. Wait, but no, because the other part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the other part, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times that term, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the other part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the other polynomial, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply it by each term in the second polynomial, which is in \\(c\\), it just adds up all the coefficients from the second polynomial.\n\nSo, let's calculate the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of coefficients, we set \\(c = 1\\), so it becomes \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's correct because I think the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is just 6, and the other part doesn't affect it. But I'm confused because the variables are separate.\n\nWait, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by every term from the second polynomial, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nTherefore, since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is 6, and the sum of coefficients in the second is 64, then the coefficient in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Suppose I have two polynomials, P and Q, where P is in variables \\(a, b\\) and Q is in \\(c\\). Then, when I multiply them, each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in P is multiplied by every term in Q, so in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P times the sum of all coefficients in Q, because each term in Q contributes a coefficient that gets multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, that would make the coefficient 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. Let me just verify that.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to consider the entire product, \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the product, and its coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another approach: perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, you have to consider the entire product.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would include all possible terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then it would be different, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's 384.\n\nWait, let me check with a smaller example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1)^1\\). Then, the expansion is \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, that's not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe another example: \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1)^1\\). Then, the expansion is \\(a \\times c + a \\times 1 + b \\times c + b \\times 1\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1\\), so if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product, it's \\(c + 1\\). So, the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But in our original problem, the variables are separate, so perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\). Wait, but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. So, maybe I need to consider only the constant term or something.\n\nWait, no, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so it's expecting a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps the only way that term exists is when multiplied by \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, it's \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which would have a different coefficient. So, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term in the \\(c\\) part.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, let's calculate that.\n\nFirst, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), as I found earlier.\n\nNext, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find that, we can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, that makes more sense because if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. So, the answer is 120.\n\nBut earlier, I thought it might be 384, but that was when considering all coefficients in the second polynomial, which would give the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64. But that would be if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which isn't the case. Instead, the problem is probably asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), it just said \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems contradictory because in the example I did earlier, if I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, which would require that the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\).\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify that. Hmm. Maybe I should go back to the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\"\n\nSo, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any mention of \\(c\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which is in \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear in the product as \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term from the second polynomial, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut in that case, the coefficient is a number, 384, and the term would be \\(384a^2b^2\\), but that's not correct because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by terms in \\(c\\), you get terms like \\(384a^2b^2c^k\\), but \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would have a coefficient that's a sum over all \\(k\\). Wait, that doesn't make sense because each term in the product would have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents and \\(c\\) exponents. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the product, but multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut then, if I think of the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the second polynomial, so the coefficient would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) is 120, but that's when considering only the constant term in \\(c\\). Since the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), I'm confused now.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if it's expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120. I need to figure out which interpretation is correct.\n\nLooking back at the problem statement: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It's a bit ambiguous because it doesn't specify the exponent of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the intended answer is 120, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\). Alternatively, if it's considering all possible exponents of \\(c\\), then it's 384.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written in such a way that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), meaning that we're treating \\(c\\) as another variable and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. Since the problem didn't specify, I'm not sure. But in most cases, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a term with specific variables, it's considering the term without any other variables. So, perhaps it's 120.\n\nWait, but in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me think again. If I have two polynomials, P and Q, and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(x^k\\) in P * Q, it's the sum over all i + j = k of (coefficient of x^i in P) * (coefficient of x^j in Q). But in our case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in P, and Q is in \\(c\\), so they don't share variables. So, when you multiply P and Q, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in Q, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^m\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P times the sum of all coefficients in Q, because each term in Q contributes to multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by a coefficient.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still confused because in the example I thought of earlier, if I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product is \\(c + 1\\), which is a polynomial. So, if the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, it's expecting a number, which would only be possible if we're considering a specific term in \\(c\\). But since the problem didn't specify, I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is written in a way that \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term, and it's present in the product with a coefficient that's a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which is a bit ambiguous. If it's expecting a numerical coefficient, then perhaps it's 120, considering only the \\(c^0\\) term. Alternatively, if it's expecting a polynomial, then it's 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 384.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the coefficient\", which is a number, so it must be 384 because that's the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by 6.\n\nWait, but in the example, if I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps in this problem, the coefficient is a polynomial, but the problem says \"the coefficient\", which is usually a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I'm stuck. Let me try to look for similar problems or think about how such problems are usually structured.\n\nI think that in problems like this, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term in a product of polynomials, and the specific term doesn't involve variables from the other polynomial, the coefficient is the product of the coefficient from the first polynomial and the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial. So, in this case, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then it would be different, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still not entirely sure. Let me try to calculate it another way. Let's expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) separately and see how the product looks.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nNext, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, the terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) are \\(c^6, 6c^4, 15c^2, 20, 15c^{-2}, 6c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6, 6a^2b^2 \\times 6c^4, 6a^2b^2 \\times 15c^2, 6a^2b^2 \\times 20, 6a^2b^2 \\times 15c^{-2}, 6a^2b^2 \\times 6c^{-4}, 6a^2b^2 \\times c^{-6}\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all these coefficients, which is 6 * (1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, that makes sense because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nSo, I think that's the correct answer. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nIn this case, the expression is \\((a + b)^4\\), so \\(n = 4\\). I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which would be \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me write out the general term in the expansion. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, I need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). That makes sense because if \\(k = 2\\), then \\(4 - 2 = 2\\), so the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is the number of combinations of 4 things taken 2 at a time. I remember that \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} = \\dfrac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\\), so plugging in the numbers, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the \\((a + b)^4\\) part is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I need to consider this part as well. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), involves \\(c\\), so when we multiply the two expansions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression should just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, that doesn't seem right because the second part is also being multiplied, but it doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term directly.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part's expansion. But that can't be right because the second part is also a variable expression. Wait, no, actually, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what happens with \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the first part, and the second part contributes a factor that is multiplied by the coefficient but doesn't affect the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is a separate expansion. Let me clarify. The entire expression is a product of two separate binomial expansions. So, when we expand both, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, which includes terms with \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), etc. However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. But wait, no, that's not quite right either because each term in the second part has its own coefficient, and when multiplied by the first part's term, it would create multiple terms in the product. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but that would mean the coefficient is a sum of multiple terms. But that can't be because the coefficient should be a single number. Wait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the possible ways \\(a^2b^2\\) can be formed, considering the multiplication by the second expansion.\n\nBut wait, no, that's not correct because \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply, \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but each of those terms is a separate term in the final product. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the second part is being multiplied, so it would affect the overall coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), etc. So, in the final expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) will have a coefficient of 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 1 (the coefficient of \\(c^6\\) in the second part). Similarly, \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) will have a coefficient of 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^4\\) in the second part, and so on. However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the sum of all the coefficients from the second part multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, no, that's not right either because each term in the second expansion has its own coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it creates a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) with a coefficient of 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all such terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. But wait, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, let's compute that.\n\nThe second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If we set \\(c = 1\\), then it becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. The second part, when expanded, has various terms, each with their own coefficients. When we multiply the two expressions, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is the sum of all the coefficients from the second part multiplied by 6. Since the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64, as calculated earlier, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) being 6, and since the second part is a separate factor, the entire expression's coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient, not the variables, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the specific term \\(a^2b^2\\) only comes from the first polynomial, and the second polynomial contributes all its terms, each multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial. Since the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check by actually expanding the second part. The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, this expansion will have terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\), with coefficients given by \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for each term \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{0} = 1\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{1} = 6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{2} = 15\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), and so on, decreasing after that. The sum of these coefficients is indeed 2^6 = 64, as we calculated earlier.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384. So, the final answer should be 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has a sum of coefficients equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

I'm specifically looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would mean \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). Calculating the binomial coefficient, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I think I can also use the binomial theorem here. The expansion would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), not \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part? Or is there more to it?\n\nWait, no, because the entire expression is a product of two polynomials: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them together, each term from the first expansion gets multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, because when you multiply 6 by each term in the second expansion, the terms involving \\(c\\) won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.

When you expand this, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear in the product with coefficients multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so it's just the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) a sum over all possible terms from the second expansion. Wait, but that can't be right because the coefficient should be a constant, not a polynomial in \\(c\\).\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps they just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply 6 by each term in the second expansion, each term would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by the corresponding term in the first expansion.\n\nWait, but that doesn't sound right either. Let me think again. The entire expression is a product of two polynomials. So, when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any power of \\(c\\), perhaps the answer is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, that seems plausible, but let me check. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so it's 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which is a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\). But since the problem doesn't specify a particular power of \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I expand it, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a constant. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which should be a constant, so perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to the overall coefficient. So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but that doesn't make sense because \\(c\\) is a separate variable. So, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) which has a term 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, and then I multiply it by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded has terms like c\u2076, c\u2074, c\u00b2, 1, c^{-2}, c^{-4}, c^{-6}. So, when I multiply 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 by each of these terms, I get 6a\u00b2b\u00b2c\u2076, 6a\u00b2b\u00b2c\u2074, etc. So, the coefficient of a\u00b2b\u00b2 in the entire product would actually be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in c, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific k, but it's not specified. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo and they meant \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but that's not stated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating c as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the powers of c, so it's 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because when you multiply 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes to a different power of c, but the coefficient of a\u00b2b\u00b2 across all terms would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. So, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is when c = 1, which is (1 + 1)^6 = 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is a product of two polynomials. So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But since the second polynomial is a sum of terms with different powers of c, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of a, b, and c are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. But that's not specified. Alternatively, maybe it's just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of c, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second polynomial, but that seems odd.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating c as another variable. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in c. But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a constant.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of a, b, and c are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a constant. So, let's approach it that way.\n\nSo, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as we found earlier.\n\nNow, from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. Because when we multiply the two parts, the exponent of c in the first part is 0, so we need the term where the exponent of c in the second part is also 0 to get \\(c^0\\) overall.\n\nSo, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of c to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\).\n\nSo, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that makes sense because we're looking for the term where a and b have exponents 2 and 2, and c has exponent 0. So, the coefficient is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), giving 120.\n\nI think that's the correct approach. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\nWait, let me confirm again. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" without specifying any power of c. So, if we consider that, then the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a constant. Therefore, it's more likely that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I think the more reasonable interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let's check with the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any power of c, so perhaps the answer is 120, as that's the coefficient when c^0 is considered. Alternatively, if it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of c, then it's 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would be a polynomial, but that's not a constant. So, I think the intended answer is 120.\n\nTherefore, I think the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2.

    "text": " So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLet me start with the first part, which is \\((a + b)^4\\). If I expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. That would correspond to \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\) and \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). Let me check that: if \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\).\n\nCalculating the binomial coefficient: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. That part seems straightforward.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part of the expression: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I also need to expand this using the binomial theorem. Each term here will be \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWait a second, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, maybe I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\)? Or do I? Let me think. The entire expression is the product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply them together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion.\n\nBut the problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to find all the terms in the product where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\) and the rest of the variables (involving \\(c\\)) are such that they don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, but actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, which are all terms involving \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think that means regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, just the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). But that doesn't make sense because the product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe the \\(c\\) part can be any term, but we're focusing on the \\(a^2b^2\\) part. So, that would mean that the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is a huge number, but I don't think that's what the problem is asking.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, so perhaps the problem is considering the entire product, and looking for the coefficient of the term that has exactly \\(a^2b^2\\) and any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, giving terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), each with coefficient 6 times the coefficient from the second expansion.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit strange because the problem is probably expecting a specific number, not an expression involving \\(c\\). So maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't make much sense because the entire expression is a product, so each term would have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. That would make sense because then we're looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, that would be a specific term in the product.\n\nIf that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, let's approach it that way.\n\nFirst, from \\((a + b)^4\\), as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nNow, from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), I get \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, I need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\).\n\nSo, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). So, the coefficient here is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me make sure I did that correctly. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when we multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\) from the second part, resulting in \\(a^2b^2\\) with a coefficient of \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nIs there any other term that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product? Let me think. Suppose I take a term from the first expansion with \\(a^k b^{4 - k}\\) and a term from the second expansion with \\(c^m\\). When I multiply them, I get \\(a^k b^{4 - k} c^m\\). The only way this can result in \\(a^2b^2\\) is if \\(k = 2\\) and \\(4 - k = 2\\), which is the case we already considered, and \\(m = 0\\). So, no other terms would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nWait, just to double-check, let me recast the problem. Suppose I'm looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would mean that the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That term would be formed by multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion by \\(c^0\\) from the second expansion. So, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to think of the entire expansion, each term would be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as before, and \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Yep, that seems consistent.\n\nI think I've got it. The coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for each part of the expression.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). The term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs is when \\(k = 2\\), giving us:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\), giving us:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

Because only then will the \\(a^2b^2\\) term not be multiplied by a \\(c\\) term, keeping it as a standalone \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, actually, no. Let me think again.

But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\).\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps they just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. So, when you multiply out the entire expression, you have terms involving \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. But that doesn't make sense because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire product as a single expression, but without considering the \\(c\\) terms. That is, perhaps they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the \\(c\\) terms, which would just be 6, but that seems too simple.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating all variables together. So, in that case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times each term from the second expansion.

Maybe I should consider that the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. So, maybe the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) in the entire expansion. That is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion.\n\nThat makes more sense. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in that case, I need to compute the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6, the coefficient from the first part.\n\nLet me check that. So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want this exponent to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that's not right. Wait, 6! is 720, but 3! is 6, so 6!/(3!3!) is 720/(6\u00d76) = 720/36 = 20. Yes, that's correct. So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when you multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider all the terms in the second expansion that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), result in \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering all the coefficients for all the terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be 6 \u00d7 20 = 120, as I thought earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all terms in the second expansion, which would be 6 \u00d7 2^6 = 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But that doesn't make sense because the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the total sum of coefficients is 64, so 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384, which seems high.\n\nWait, but that would be the case if we were considering the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). That is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion.\n\nIn that case, the coefficient would be 6 \u00d7 20 = 120, as I thought earlier. So, I think that's the correct approach. Let me confirm:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the constant term, which is 20.\n\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together because in the product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion, resulting in the term \\(6 \\times 20 \\times a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient is 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't misinterpret the problem. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a number, not an expression.\n\nTherefore, it's more plausible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), which would be 120. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense in the context of the question. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), which is 120.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n- Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n- Constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\n- Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nHence, the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " \n\nSo, in this case, the expression is \\((a + b)^4\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I'm looking for the term where the power of \\(a\\) is 2 and the power of \\(b\\) is 2. Let me write that out.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem for \\((a + b)^4\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I want the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider both parts. Let me think about how these two parts interact.\n\nSince the two parts are multiplied together, the entire expression is a product of two expansions. That means I'll have to consider terms from each expansion and how they combine. Specifically, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. \n\nBut here's the thing: \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) only appear in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) only appear in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply these two expansions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) come from the first expansion, and the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) come from the second expansion. \n\nWait a second, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), multiplied by the entire second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), evaluated at the term that gives a constant, because we don't want any \\(c\\) terms in the final product. \n\nIs that right? Let me make sure. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), we need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is a constant, i.e., where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out.\n\nSo, first, let me find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which we already found to be 6. Then, I need to find the constant term in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nTo find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can again use the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero for the term to be constant. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the first part gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives 20 for the constant term. Since these are multiplied together, the overall coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about it another way to confirm. Let me write out the entire expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, and then this is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we only care about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only term that contributes is when the second part is a constant. So, the 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 is multiplied by 20, giving 120a\u00b2b\u00b2. So, yes, the coefficient is 120.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is given by:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each. This occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is given by:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Setting \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) gives \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient. Let me think about this.\n\nThe entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since these are two separate binomial expressions multiplied together, the terms from each expansion will multiply term by term. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient related to \\(a^2b^2\\), the other part doesn't affect it. Wait, is that right?\n\nLet me clarify. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression multiplies each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term in the first part is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and when I multiply it by the entire second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering any \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe the \\(c\\) part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) at all. Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term will be something like \\(6a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms would be zero, right? Because all the terms would have either \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) multiplied in.\n\nWait, that seems confusing. Let me think again. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps it's just the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), contributes a factor that is multiplied by the coefficient, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the entire expansion of the second part is just a scalar multiple? No, that doesn't make sense because the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so it's not a scalar.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to find the term in the expansion where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a specific term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest is separate. But that seems too simple, so perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. That would make sense because otherwise, if we're just looking for \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), it's a bit ambiguous. So, maybe I need to consider both parts together.\n\nLet me try that approach. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That would mean I have to find terms in each expansion such that when multiplied together, the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively.\n\nSo, starting with \\((a + b)^4\\), as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nNow, looking at \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 because I want \\(c^0\\) in the final product. So, the general term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). I need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the term is \\(20c^0 = 20\\).\n\nNow, since the two parts are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, that's \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, so that would mean the coefficient is 120. Let me check if that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to think of the entire expansion, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives terms with \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(a b^3\\), and \\(b^4\\), each multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), it's only the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the question is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms from the second expansion multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\). However, if the question is just about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial, but the coefficient itself isn't a single number. So, maybe I'm overcomplicating it again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, implying a numerical value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), as I thought earlier. So, in that case, the coefficient is 120. Let me see if that's correct.\n\nSo, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nIn \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, when multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think the answer is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, for \\(c^0\\), \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. That's correct.\n\nAnd in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). The general term is given by:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. This occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The general term is given by:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. This occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\n\\]\nThe coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nSince we are looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), we multiply the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."
