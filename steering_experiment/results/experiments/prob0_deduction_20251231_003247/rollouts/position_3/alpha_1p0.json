    "text": " So for \\((a + b)^4\\), I can expand it term by term. Let me write that out.\n\nThe expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) would be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\n\\]\n\nSo the terms would be:\n\n- When \\(k = 0\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 = 1 \\cdot a^4 = a^4\\)\n- When \\(k = 1\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 = 4a^3b\\)\n- When \\(k = 2\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\)\n- When \\(k = 3\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 = 4ab^3\\)\n- When \\(k = 4\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4 = 1 \\cdot b^4 = b^4\\)\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire product.\n\nHmm, so maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is the product of two binomial expansions. So, perhaps I should first find the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by \\((a + b)^4\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe I can treat the two parts separately.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will only come from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the terms involving \\(c\\) will come from the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply them together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the entire product will have terms that are products of terms from both expansions. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the sum of all terms in the second part, because any term from the second part will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a constant term in terms of \\(c\\), maybe we need to find the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nWait, that might be it. Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 (the coefficient from the first part) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second part, because each term in the second part will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributing to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, that can't be right because the second part has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), so unless we're looking for a specific term involving \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire second part. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would involve \\(c\\) terms, which isn't a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is implicitly asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the constant term in \\(c\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the product.\n\nOkay, that makes more sense. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), I need to consider the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) from the second part. So, first, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier.\n\nNow, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, i.e., \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\):\n\n\\(6 - 2k = 0\\)\n\n\\(2k = 6\\)\n\n\\(k = 3\\)\n\nSo, the term where \\(k = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20 \\times 1 = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20.\n\nNow, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it's the product of the coefficients from each part. So, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)) gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20. When you multiply these two terms together, you get 6 * 20 * \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120 \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Is there any other term in the product that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)? For example, could a term with higher powers of \\(c\\) or lower powers somehow combine with terms from the first expansion to give \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)? Hmm, no, because each term in the first expansion only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and each term in the second expansion only involves \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are independent of the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and the \\(c^0\\) term from the second expansion. So, their product is the only contribution to \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), and thus the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, to think about it another way, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. In this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), and \\(c^0\\) is a specific term in the second polynomial, the only product that contributes is 6 * 20, as I found.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\n\\]\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion is found when \\(k = 2\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\):\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\nThe coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " So for \\((a + b)^4\\), each term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\), where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to think about how this part affects the coefficient. Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the part with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) might be independent, right? So maybe the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will just multiply the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\).\n\nWait, but hold on, actually, the entire expression is a product of two expansions. So when you multiply them together, each term from the first expansion will multiply each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to make sure that the other parts (the ones involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\)) don't affect this. Hmm, but actually, when you multiply, the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient will be multiplied by the sum of all terms in the second expansion. Wait, no, that can't be right because each term in the product will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. But we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part, because every term in the second part will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, effectively adding all their coefficients together. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because each term in the second expansion is a separate term, so when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second expansion contributes its own coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, let me make sure I'm thinking correctly. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), when expanded, has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms like \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k\\) from 0 to 6. The sum of all these terms is the entire second expansion. But when we multiply the two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will multiply each term from the second expansion. So the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me verify that. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since we're looking for a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and not \\(c\\), we need to consider that in the product, each term from the first expansion (which has \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)) is multiplied by each term from the second expansion (which has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\)). But since we're only interested in the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient will be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), and since we don't care about the \\(c\\) terms, we just add them all together.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the entire expression is the product of two independent expansions. So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because every term in the second expansion contributes to multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So that would indeed be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check this because sometimes when you have multiple variables, you have to be careful about cross terms. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, each contributing their own coefficient. So the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient from the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion.\n\nTo confirm, let's compute the sum of coefficients in the second expansion. As I said earlier, substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So the sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but hold on again. Let me think differently. Suppose I don't substitute \\(c = 1\\), but instead, I realize that each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\), so the coefficient of each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\). So when I multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by each term in the second expansion, I'm effectively summing over all \\(k\\) the product of 6 and \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\). So the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). But the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\), so again, 6 times 64 is 384.\n\nTherefore, I think the coefficient is 384. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Multiplying them together gives 384. So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is to consider that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the multiplication doesn't mix the terms. So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nYes, that makes sense. So I think 384 is the correct coefficient.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Each term in this expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives:\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

But wait, I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to consider the terms involving \\(c\\) because they won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the part with \\(c\\) can be anything because when you multiply by that, it just adds more terms, but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) remains 6. Wait, no, actually, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But in this case, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\) and the second is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But wait, no, that's not correct either because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product. But in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again: it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, in the expansion, \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by some expression involving \\(c\\), but the coefficient would be the numerical factor in front of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what's with \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient is 6 times whatever the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is. Wait, no, that's not right either. Because when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's not correct because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by 6, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion. But actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is likely asking for a numerical coefficient. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the \\(c\\) part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6, as that's the coefficient from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, and the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part is just another factor that's multiplied, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's just written as \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, but the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^4\\), etc., depending on the expansion of the second part. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient would then be a sum of coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Wait, no, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high. Wait, let me check that again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's not a number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that seems unlikely because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients would multiply.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times whatever the expansion of the second part is, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, meaning that we have to consider the product. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6, but that seems too simple.\n\nWait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, in that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, then multiply them together.\n\nAh, that makes more sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product would be the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, first, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNow, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do this, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but the problem just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it by considering \\(c\\). Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems incorrect because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a sum over all \\(c\\) terms, which is not a single number. Therefore, I think the correct approach is to interpret the problem as asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check again. If I just consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), it's 6, and since the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when I multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, but that's not correct because the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and I don't think that's what the problem is asking.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a single number. So, maybe the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, but that seems too simple.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. So, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". In the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems complicated, and I think the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that's if we're setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives the sum of all coefficients, but the problem isn't asking for that. It's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be 6 times the expansion of the second part, but that's not a single number. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think differently. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems odd because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the intended answer is 120, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\).\n\nWait, but to be thorough, let me check what happens when I expand both parts:\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nSecond, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15\\dfrac{1}{c^2} + 6\\dfrac{1}{c^4} + \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply these two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6*1 = 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 6*6 = 36, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^2\\) is 6*15 = 90, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6*20 = 120, and so on. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120.\n\nBut the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, because the second part is just a multiplier that affects the \\(c\\) terms, not the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that seems incorrect because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients do multiply.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^{10}\\) or something similar, but as it is, I have to work with \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would mean that we have to consider all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, I think the intended answer is 120, which is the coefficient when \\(c^0\\) is considered.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking.\n\nWait, but if I think about it, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you write the product, it's 6*(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient is a polynomial. But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number. Therefore, I think the correct approach is to interpret the problem as asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\). The product is \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is 6*(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6). But that seems complicated, and the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the intended answer is 120, which is the coefficient when \\(c^0\\) is considered.\n\nSo, to summarize, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's the answer the problem is expecting.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the product of the binomial coefficients from each part of the expression. Specifically, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would involve terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), etc., each multiplied by a binomial coefficient.\n\nIn this case, I specifically need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I can think about which term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) corresponds to \\(a^2b^2\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I want \\(a^2b^2\\), so that means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is equal to \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nBut wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient. Hmm, actually, when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients of their respective terms multiply together. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second part of the expression, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficients from the two parts are independent.\n\nSo, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) must be 1. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again.\n\nActually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if I have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and any term from the second part, the resulting term will be \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{(something with c)}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that we're looking for the coefficient when the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second polynomial. Because if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any other term from the second polynomial, it would have a power of \\(c\\) attached, and thus the term wouldn't just be \\(a^2b^2\\); it would have an extra factor of \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\).\n\nTherefore, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already found to be 6.\n\nSo, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying the exponents, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes here. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is indeed 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying them gives 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as the product of two separate expansions, and when multiplying, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will only be affected by the constant term from the second expansion because any other term would introduce a power of \\(c\\), which isn't present in \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, I think I'm confident that 120 is the correct coefficient.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by multiplying the binomial coefficients from each part of the expression. In \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would be the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\).

Calculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which involves only \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, their coefficients won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. That means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), right? Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply, but here, the other expression doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so it's just 1 multiplied by 6. Therefore, the coefficient should be 6. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything here. Maybe I need to consider how the entire expression is expanded. Let me think again.\n\nWait, actually, the entire expression is a product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them together, each term from the first expansion gets multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second expansion only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), any term in the second expansion that has \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term because they don't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the entire second expansion's sum. Wait, that doesn't sound right because the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since we're looking for a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe we need to find the constant term in the second expansion, because only then would multiplying by it not introduce any \\(c\\) terms, keeping the term as \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a constant term, you just get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant, contributing to the coefficient. So, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients: 6 (from the first expansion) multiplied by 20 (from the second expansion), which gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanding, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will only contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product if it's multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. Because if it's multiplied by any term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, only the constant term in the second expansion will contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the entire expression is the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficients multiply. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, so when you multiply them, you get 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Correct. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where exponent is 0 is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k=3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Correct. So, 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but another thought: does the problem consider the entire expression as a product, so when you multiply the two expansions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but only the term with \\(c^0\\) would result in a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Yes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't consider the second part, and just thought about \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient is 6. But since the second part is also being multiplied, and only the constant term affects the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations. Let me just recap: binomial coefficients for both expansions, found the right term in each, multiplied them, got 120. That seems solid.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) is given by:\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{2} a^2 b^2\n\\]\nCalculating the binomial coefficient:\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

    "text": " So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would involve terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), and so on. Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can focus on that specific term in the expansion.\n\nLet me write out the term for \\(a^2b^2\\). The general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, when \\(k = 2\\), the term becomes \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^{2}b^{2}\\). Calculating the binomial coefficient, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is equal to \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the expression also has another part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider this part as well. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). That means, regardless of the expansion of the second part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and it doesn't depend on \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient remains 6?\n\nWait, hold on. Let me think again. The entire expression is the product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. However, since we're interested only in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the entire expansion of the second part would include terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the question is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\).\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me re-examine the problem. The question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two expressions, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. However, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, that can't be. Maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the question is treating \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) as separate variables, and we're looking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is raised to some power, but the problem didn't specify any condition on \\(c\\). Hmm, but the way it's phrased, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a single number.\n\nBut the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number, not a polynomial. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not correct either because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nBut wait, no, that's not quite right. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's not a single number. So, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. That would make the coefficient just 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, let me think of it that way. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the sum from \\(k=0\\) to \\(6\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\), which simplifies to \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem didn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, if we're considering the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, which includes different powers of \\(c\\). But if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, I think it's safe to assume that they're asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is phrased such that it's considering the product as a single polynomial in variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable. But in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are typically constants. So, I think the intended interpretation is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nTherefore, after going through the binomial expansions and calculating the necessary coefficients, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). Setting \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) gives \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients:**\n   Multiply the coefficients from both expansions: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, right? Because that's the middle term.\n\nBut wait, in this problem, the expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by another expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the second part. So when I multiply these two expansions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will only come from the first part, and the terms involving \\(c\\) will come from the second part. \n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I'm only interested in the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of what happens with \\(c\\). So maybe I can treat the two parts separately. Let me think: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to consider how that affects the coefficient. But wait, does it? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, so each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, for example, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, which is \\(6a^2b^2\\), will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think that means we're considering the entire expansion, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). But wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but without considering the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, that might not make sense because the entire expression is a product of two separate expressions, so each term in the product will be a combination of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion.\n\nWait, but the problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So that would mean that we're looking for all the terms in the product where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). So the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But wait, that doesn't seem right because the second part isn't just a constant; it's an expression with \\(c\\) terms.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me clarify: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first polynomial and \\(c\\) is only in the second, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't affect the terms involving \\(c\\) in the product. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), meaning that it's the sum of all the coefficients in the product where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But if we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then perhaps we need to sum all those contributions.\n\nWait, that might be the case. Let me think: If I have \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left( \\text{something} \\right)\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in the second expansion will multiply the \\(6a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6\\) times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nBut wait, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So if I substitute \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So the answer would be 384.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Because when you have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So each term in the second expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\), and when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(6\\dbinom{6}{k}a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\). So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum over all \\(k\\) of \\(6\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), because each term contributes a coefficient to \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But if we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then we would sum all these coefficients, which is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\), so the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then we need to find the coefficient where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. In that case, we need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So I think it's more likely that they want the coefficient regardless of the power of \\(c\\), meaning that we sum over all possible exponents of \\(c\\). So that would make the coefficient \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nBut to be sure, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second part. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So perhaps I was wrong earlier, and the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1.\n\nIn that case, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So I think that's the correct interpretation. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is in the second part, the only way for \\(a^2b^2\\) to appear without any \\(c\\) terms is when it's multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, which is when \\(c^0\\). So that would be the case when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which happens when \\(k = 3\\) in the binomial expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but that was when considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product, and in the product, each term will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents and \\(c\\) exponents. So if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that would mean that we're summing over all possible \\(c\\) exponents, which would give us 384. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120.\n\nI think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so the answer would be 384. But I'm a bit confused because usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term in a product, you have to specify all variables. So perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so it's ambiguous. But in the context of such problems, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term with some variables, it's often implied that you're considering the term with those variables and any power of the other variables. But in this case, since the other variables are \\(c\\), which is separate, it's a bit tricky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the question is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when all variables are considered, but since \\(c\\) is separate, the coefficient would be the sum of all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^{10}\\) or something like that, but as it stands, it's \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but if I think about it, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product comes from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part by any term in the second part. So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nBut if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nI think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), so 120, because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial, which doesn't make sense in this context. So I'll go with 120.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me think again. The problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So when you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m = \\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). So the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\), so to get the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), we need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient from the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then we would sum over all possible \\(m\\), so the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nBut in the context of the problem, it's more likely that they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So I think that's the answer.\n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Let's compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but in this case, \\((a + b)^2\\) is \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\). So the product is \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2ab c + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product is zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But if I consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that's also zero. But if I consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's still zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Hmm, that's a bit confusing.\n\nWait, maybe my example isn't the best. Let's take a different example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1 = (a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). Expanding this gives \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^1\\) is 1, and the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^{-1}\\) is 1, and similarly for the other terms. So if I were to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\), it would be the sum of the coefficients of \\(a^1b^0c^k\\) for all \\(k\\), which would be 2, since each term \\(ac\\) and \\(a/c\\) contributes 1 each. So in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 2.\n\nSimilarly, in the original problem, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it would be the sum of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for all \\(k\\), which is 6 times 64 = 384.\n\nBut in my earlier example, the problem would be to find the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), which is 2. So in that case, it's the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^k\\) summed over all \\(k\\). So in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 384.\n\nBut then, in the example, the term \\(a^1b^0\\) exists in the product as \\(ac\\) and \\(a/c\\), so the coefficient is 2. Similarly, in the original problem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) exists as \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), etc., and the coefficients of each of these terms would be 6 times the respective binomial coefficients. So the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) is 6 times the sum of the binomial coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, so 384.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)**: Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**: The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients**: The total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer**: \\boxed{384}"

    "text": " So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would involve terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), and so on, each multiplied by their respective binomial coefficients.\n\nSo, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me find the coefficient for that term. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, when \\(k = 2\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^{2}b^{2}\\). Calculating the binomial coefficient, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm not sure if this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are different variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps I only need to consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and the rest doesn't matter because it's multiplied by something else.\n\nWait, but actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider how the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) interact with \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, but wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term from the first part, and when you multiply it by the second part, it would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the other variables, maybe I just need to consider the coefficient from the first part and then multiply it by the sum of the coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part would just add another factor.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion would just contribute a factor when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be a term in the product. But in reality, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by every possible term from the second expansion.\n\nWait, but that might not be correct. Let me clarify. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when you multiply it by the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it's being multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because each term in the second expansion is a constant coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it just adds a factor to the coefficient.\n\nWait, but actually, no. Because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then perhaps it's just 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but actually, the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we're being asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, which is a series in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but let me think again. The second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's compute that. Using the binomial theorem, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). The coefficients are all the binomial coefficients, which are positive integers. The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients from the second part), giving 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check if that's correct.\n\nWait, but actually, no. Because when you have the product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all the terms in the other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), adds a multiple of that term's coefficient to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nSo, in this case, the coefficient from the first part is 6, and the sum of the coefficients from the second part is 64, so the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the variables don't interact. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product comes only from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm by actually computing the second expansion's sum of coefficients. The second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\), which matches what I thought earlier. So, yes, the sum is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the other variables. So, in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term from the second part, which has coefficients as per their binomial expansion. Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that the variables are independent, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the other part doesn't affect it. But that can't be right because the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, so the coefficients would combine.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing something here. Let me take a step back. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when you multiply it by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because each term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), just adds a multiple to the coefficient.\n\nSo, yes, that would make the coefficient 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with a smaller example to see if this approach is correct. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1)^1\\). The expansion would be \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product is zero because the first expansion only goes up to \\(b^2\\), but the second expansion is linear in \\(c\\). Wait, but actually, in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is not present in the product because the first expansion only has up to \\(b^2\\), but when multiplied by the second, which is degree 1 in \\(c\\), the product would have terms like \\(a^2c\\), \\(a^2\\), \\(2abc\\), \\(2ab\\), \\(b^2c\\), \\(b^2\\). So, \\(a^2b^2\\) is not present, so the coefficient is zero. But according to my earlier approach, the coefficient from the first part for \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because \\((a + b)^2\\) only goes up to \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\), but not \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that would correctly give zero.\n\nAnother example: \\((a + b)^3 (c + 1)^1\\). The first expansion is \\(a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3\\). The second is \\(c + 1\\). The product would have terms like \\(a^3c\\), \\(a^3\\), \\(3a^2bc\\), \\(3a^2b\\), etc. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't appear in the product. But the coefficient from the first part for \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero, so the total coefficient is zero, which is correct.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\), which does have \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. So, when multiplied by the second expansion, which has a sum of coefficients 64, the total coefficient should be 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that this approach is correct. Another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum over all terms in the second polynomial of (coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in first * coefficient of term in second). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first polynomial, and not in the second, the coefficient is just (coefficient from first) times (sum of coefficients in second).\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with another approach. Let me consider that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first polynomial, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes its coefficient to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nSo, yes, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is more straightforward. Since the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). Wait, but that can't be right because when you multiply, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's effectively the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, but if I think of it as a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean summing over all possible \\(k\\). So, that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another approach. Let me compute the product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the final answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me just check with a concrete example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when I multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6*1=6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 6*6=36, \\(a^2b^2c^2\\) is 6*15=90, \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6*20=120, \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\) is 6*15=90, \\(a^2b^2c^{-4}\\) is 6*6=36, and \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\) is 6*1=6. So, if we sum all these coefficients, 6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6 = 384. So, that confirms that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 384, as each term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) with different powers of \\(c\\) adds up to 384.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the coefficient is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\).

So, I need to consider the entire expression. But hold on, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), right?

But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which isn't a single number. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any term from the second expansion, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term on its own, maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and when you multiply by each term in the second expansion, you get 6 times each of those terms. But that seems like it would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but maybe I'm supposed to consider that when multiplying, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, so that the resulting term is \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant. Let me check that. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out. That happens when we have an equal number of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms. So, in the expansion, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want this exponent to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), which gives 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, when we multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, giving \\(6 * 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. \n\nBut wait, is that the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\)? Because when you multiply, you're combining terms from both expansions. So, if you have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and any term from the second part, the resulting term would be \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, every term in the second expansion will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) part, it's actually the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. \n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because if you have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^k\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any consideration for \\(c\\). So, perhaps it's just 6 times the entire expansion, which would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but that can't be right because the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 would be 384. But that seems too high. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's 6 times the entire expansion, which would mean the coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384. But that feels off because I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in the second expansion, which would be 6 times 20 = 120. \n\nWait, I'm confused now. Let me clarify. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), each with their own coefficients. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, it's asking for the sum of all coefficients where the term is \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times any \\(c^k\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nBut let's check: the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 384. \n\nWait, but that seems high. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would include all the \\(c\\) terms, but the problem didn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would be the same as the coefficient from the first part, because the second part is multiplied by it. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is a separate variable. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in the second expansion, which would be 6*20=120. That makes more sense because if you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), but in the product, the only way to have \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is to multiply by the constant term from the second expansion. \n\nWait, but if you consider the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term from the second expansion, each contributing to different terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then it's the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 6*20=120. \n\nI think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term, so 120. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire expression, which includes \\(c\\) terms. So, if you look for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the sum of all terms from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. \n\nWait, but that seems too large. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the same as the coefficient in the first part, because the second part is a separate variable. But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try a different approach. Let me consider that the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, and it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times each of those terms, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nSo, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut I'm still unsure because I think the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term, which would be 6 * 20 = 120. Let me check this again. \n\nWait, if I consider the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term from the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 times the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, so 6*20=120. \n\nBut if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. \n\nI think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term, so 120. Because otherwise, it would have specified that it's considering all possible \\(c\\) terms. \n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and in the product, each term is a combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient times \\(c^k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nTherefore, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), so 6*64=384. \n\nWait, but that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term, so 6*20=120. \n\nI think I need to clarify this. Let me look up similar problems. Usually, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a specific term in a product of two expressions, it's considering the term in the product that has exactly that combination of variables. So, in this case, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's looking for the term where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\) and any combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But that's not possible because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the constant term. \n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify any \\(c\\) terms, so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be the same as the coefficient in the first part because the second part is a separate variable. But that can't be right because the second part is multiplied by the first, so each term is a product. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by each term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion has multiple terms. \n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient times \\(c^k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. \n\nBut I'm still unsure because I think the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term, which would be 6*20=120. \n\nWait, maybe I should look at the problem differently. Let me consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include all possible terms with \\(a^2b^2\\) and any powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6*64=384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 6*20=120. \n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any \\(c\\) terms, so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. \n\nBut I'm still not confident. Let me try to compute it step by step. \n\nFirst, compute \\((a + b)^4\\). The expansion is:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nNext, compute \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nThe constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so:\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\nSo, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nNow, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nIf the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. The sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nHowever, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term, then it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nGiven that the problem didn't specify any \\(c\\) terms, I think it's more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term, which is 120. \n\nWait, but let me think again. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, it's considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. \n\nBut I'm still confused because I think the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the entire product and see. Let me consider that \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of \\(c\\), is the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, which is 6*64=384. \n\nBut that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term, which is 120. \n\nI think I need to make a decision here. Given that the problem didn't specify any \\(c\\) terms, I think it's more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term, which is 120. So, I'll go with that.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would involve terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\), each multiplied by a binomial coefficient.\n\nIn this case, since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would be when \\(a\\) is raised to the 2nd power and \\(b\\) is also raised to the 2nd power. So, using the binomial theorem, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) would be the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), right?\n\nLet me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. That part seems straightforward.\n\nNow, looking at the entire expression, it's multiplied by another binomial: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait a second, but the term I'm looking for is \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). That means the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't depend on the \\(c\\) part because it's only looking for the coefficient when \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second binomial. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, maybe the coefficient is just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So perhaps I need to consider whether the \\(c\\) part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, actually, no. Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so when you multiply the two expressions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't sound right because the coefficients in the second binomial expansion might not all be 1.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\) and doesn't involve \\(c\\). So when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the other binomial, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second binomial, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but the sum of the coefficients in a binomial expansion \\((x + y)^n\\) is found by setting \\(x = 1\\) and \\(y = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me check that again. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, if I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\) which has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), and then I multiply it by \\( \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\), which has 64 as the sum of its coefficients, then the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is \\(6 * 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me think differently. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the expansion of the product, each term would be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) times \\(c^n\\) or something like that. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term, regardless of the \\(c\\) part, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second binomial, which sums to 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another thought: perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by terms involving \\(c\\), you might end up with \\(c\\) terms. But the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent. If that's the case, then yes, it would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the entire product is a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\), and I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second binomial, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me think about how the multiplication works. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, in this case, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Each of these terms is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\).\n\nTherefore, when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, you get \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2k}\\) for each \\(k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum over all \\(k\\) of \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). Because each term contributes \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{k}\\) to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we sum all these coefficients.\n\nSo, the total coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But the sum of the binomial coefficients \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}\\) is equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\), as I thought earlier. Therefore, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me confirm this by calculating the sum explicitly. The sum \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}\\) is indeed \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is more straightforward. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\) and doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it: when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in one part is multiplied by the entire other expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the entire second expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded has 64 as the sum of its coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm not overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, yes, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second binomial, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the product of the two expansions, so each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each contributing their own coefficients. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) part, the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion would be \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 times (c + 1/c), so the coefficient would be 1 * (1 + 1) = 2, since the sum of coefficients in the second binomial is 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) would be 1 * 2 = 2. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 2, which is 1 (from the first binomial) times 2 (sum of coefficients in the second binomial). So, that seems to check out.\n\nSimilarly, if I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{2}{2} = 1\\) times the sum of coefficients in the second binomial, which is \\( (1 + 1)^2 = 4\\), so 1 * 4 = 4. Alternatively, the expansion would be \\(a^2 \\times (c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2)\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0c^0\\) would be 4, which matches. So, this seems to confirm that the approach is correct.\n\nTherefore, applying this to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I'm not missing anything here. Is there any possibility that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\)? If that's the case, then the coefficient would be different because we'd have to find the specific term in the second binomial where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, and then multiply that by 6.\n\nWait, that's a good point. Let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It just says \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, does that mean we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), or specifically when \\(c^0\\) is multiplied by it?\n\nHmm, in algebra, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) in a product of polynomials, it usually means the coefficient of that term regardless of the other variables. So, in this case, the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the second binomial multiplied by 6, which is 384.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. If the problem had specified \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we would have to find the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's asking for the coefficient regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, the answer would be 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to compute it both ways to be sure.\n\nFirst, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nIf it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when the exponents from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out.\n\nIn \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nBut the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nWait, but let me check the problem statement again: it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the product. So, in the context of polynomials, when you have multiple variables, the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) would include all possible exponents of the other variables. So, the coefficient would be the sum of the coefficients of all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut to be absolutely sure, let me consider an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The expansion would be \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), so the coefficient is 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second binomial, which is 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) is also 2. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 2, which is 1 * 2.\n\nTherefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second binomial, which is 64, so 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused now because earlier I thought it might be 120 if we consider only the \\(c^0\\) term, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\). So, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the expansion as \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term from the second binomial. So, each of these terms would be \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all the coefficients from the second binomial multiplied by 6. So, that's 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 * 20 = 120. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's 384.\n\nWait, but I'm going to check with another example to be absolutely sure. Let's take \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion would be \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be \\(1 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), so the coefficient is 2, which is 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second binomial (which is 2). Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^1\\) would be \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^0b^2\\) would be \\(1 \\times 2 = 2\\). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) is 2, which is 1 times 2.\n\nTherefore, applying this to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second binomial, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I just want to make sure I'm not missing any subtlety here. Another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one part is multiplied by each term in the other polynomial, but when you're summing coefficients, you have to consider all possible contributions.\n\nWait, but in this case, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second binomial. Because each term in the second binomial contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nTherefore, I think I've convinced myself that the coefficient is 384.\n\nBut wait, let me just calculate \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) to confirm the sum of coefficients. The sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of coefficients is indeed 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

That would happen when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, plugging that in, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I think that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and since the other part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term itself doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient would just be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. Because the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product. So, actually, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), that term will just be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but that can't be, because the coefficient should be a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expanded expression, considering the multiplication by the second part. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), its coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems complicated because it's a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\).\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), its coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make much sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient when considering all variables, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's just 6, because the other part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that seems too simplistic because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients would be multiplied.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), we need to consider how the multiplication affects it. Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when we multiply it by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the result will be \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient should be a numerical value, not an expression in \\(c\\).\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't make much sense either because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients are multiplied. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, but then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not quite right either.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me approach it differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then the rest is just multiplied as is.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients would be multiplied. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, maybe I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6 to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nThat makes more sense. So, let me try that approach. First, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Then, multiply that by 6, which is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product.\n\nOkay, so how do I find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Using the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Let me compute it correctly. 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 720 / (6 \\times 6) = 720 / 36 = 20\\). Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me confirm that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. Then, when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the only term that affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the constant term in the second expansion, because any other term would introduce a power of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would make the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or similar, but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to multiply by the constant term, which is 20. Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me go through it again. In \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs at \\(k = 3\\), so the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, when multiplying the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by 20, giving a total coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. So, yes, I think that's correct.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. The key was realizing that since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), only the constant term in the second expansion affects its coefficient in the product. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Using the binomial coefficients, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), since we choose 2 \\(a\\)s and 2 \\(b\\)s. Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. Now, the expression also has \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to see if this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, actually, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so when we multiply the two expressions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't affect the terms involving \\(c\\). That means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not exactly right. Because when you multiply two polynomials together, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, if I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term is present only in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by any term from the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it will just add a factor from the second expansion. However, since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), that means we need to consider the entire coefficient when \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. Wait, no, actually, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But wait, that doesn't make sense because the entire expansion is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion, which would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is not a single number but a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests that it's a numerical coefficient, not involving \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, it's treating the entire expression as a polynomial in multiple variables, and we're just interested in the coefficient attached to \\(a^2b^2\\), irrespective of what's happening with \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some term in \\(c\\), but the way it's phrased, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms from the second expansion. But that seems a bit odd because usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term in a product of two expressions, it's considering all possible combinations. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. Let's consider that \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is another expansion. So, when you multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check that again. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\), which is the sum of all coefficients in that expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure if that's the correct approach because the problem might be expecting just the coefficient from the first part, but that seems unlikely because the entire expression is a product of two binomials. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), meaning that the coefficient is 6 times that expansion, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. However, the problem asks for the coefficient, which is typically a number, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we can treat the entire expression as a product and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient in the sense of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, but that would require that the second part contributes a term with \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, maybe I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by 6. Let me try that approach. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We set the exponent equal to zero: 6 - 2k = 0 \u21d2 k = 3. So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense because when you multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20, so the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the correct answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiply them together: 6 * 20 = 120. Yes, that seems correct.

    "text": " So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would involve terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), etc. Since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can probably find that term specifically without expanding the entire expression.\n\nSo, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) would be when the binomial coefficient is calculated for \\(k = 2\\), because the exponent on \\(b\\) is 2. The binomial coefficient for \\(k = 2\\) in \\(n = 4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. That seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder if I need to expand this as well. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all, so maybe I don't need to worry about the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Instead, perhaps I just need to consider that the entire expression is a product of two independent expansions, and since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can treat the other part as a constant multiplier.\n\nWait, let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only looking for terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\), the other variable terms (involving \\(c\\)) can be anything, right? Or do I need to consider the entire coefficient?\n\nWait, no, actually, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). It doesn't specify any particular term involving \\(c\\). So, maybe I need to consider that when I multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every possible term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem doesn't specify any particular term involving \\(c\\), perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then involve terms with \\(c\\), which aren't present in \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think that in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), setting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64.\n\nBut wait, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times 64, which is 384? That seems high, but let me check. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that we also want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so that the term is just a constant. That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would involve terms with \\(c\\), which isn't possible since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\).\n\nSo, if that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense because then the entire term would be a constant, and the coefficient would just be a number.\n\nSo, let's proceed with that approach. First, as I found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do this, I can expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem as well.\n\nThe expansion would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k - k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe are looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, since the original expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) (which is just \\(a^2b^2\\)) is the product of the coefficients we found. That is, 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which equals 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial, right? So, if I'm looking for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and \\(c^0\\) in the second part, then yes, their coefficients multiply to give the coefficient in the product. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then technically, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in that expansion. But that would result in a coefficient that is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, it's more logical that the problem is asking for the coefficient when the term is independent of \\(c\\), i.e., when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, I think my approach is correct.\n\nJust to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives 120, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, I think that's the answer.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Is there a possibility that the problem is asking for something else? For example, maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but the problem didn't specify, so I think it's safe to assume that \\(k = 0\\) because otherwise, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) wouldn't involve \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident with that answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n$\\boxed{120}$"

So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\), where k goes from 0 to 4.\n\nNow, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the term where the exponent of a is 2 and the exponent of b is also 2. That means I need to find k such that 4 - k = 2 and k = 2. So, when k = 2, the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^{2}b^{2}\\). Let me compute that binomial coefficient. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, right? Because 4! / (2! * 2!) = (24)/(2 * 2) = 24 / 4 = 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nBut wait, the problem isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by another expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think the next step is to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient we found. Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't involve a or b, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second polynomial doesn't have any a or b terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because that would make the coefficient a sum, not a single value.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of c. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when you multiply it out, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the terms where a and b are squared, the c terms can be anything. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right either because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the other expansion, but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), the other part can be any term, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But actually, no, that's not correct because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when we set c=1, but that's not necessary here.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making this more complicated than it is. Let me approach it differently. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect the exponents of a and b. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the entire expansion would be a sum of terms with different powers of c, and we're supposed to find a single coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of c's powers. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that might be the case because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the other expansion, the coefficient accumulates as 6 times the sum of the coefficients of each term in the other expansion.\n\nBut let me think again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a sum of terms like \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in that expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\), where k ranges from 0 to 6. Now, when we multiply this by \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term from \\((a + b)^4\\), the result is \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each of these terms will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a term in the other expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6 (the coefficient from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)).\n\nWait, but actually, no. Because each term in the product is \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting c=1, which gives us \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward, and I'm not sure if that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the c terms, which would mean that the coefficient is just 6, because the other part is multiplied by anything, but that doesn't seem right because the problem is written as a product, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because we're looking for a specific coefficient.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the powers of c. That is, in the entire expansion, how many times does \\(a^2b^2\\) appear, multiplied by some combination of c terms. But in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try a different approach. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this product, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^{k} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^{k}c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, we are interested in the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so that requires that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, k=2. Then, for each such term, the exponent of c is \\(6 - 2m\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the exponent of c, the coefficient will be the sum over all m from 0 to 6 of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\).\n\nBut \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\) is equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times 64 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but that seems like a lot. Let me check if that makes sense. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's not correct because the problem doesn't specify any condition on c, so the coefficient would include all possible c terms multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nBut let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, without considering c, which would mean that the coefficient is 6, because the c terms are separate. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, if the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of its coefficients is when c=1, which is 2^6=64. Therefore, 6*64=384.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " So, for each term in the expansion, the exponents of a and b will add up to 4 in this case, since it's \\((a + b)^4\\). \n\nSo, I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need the term where the exponent of a is 2 and the exponent of b is 2. Let me figure out what k is in the binomial expansion for this term. Since the exponents add up to 4, and I want a^2b^2, that would mean that in the expansion, the term is when k=2, because the exponent of b is k, right? So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2 b^2\\). \n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 4! / (2! * (4-2)!) = (24)/(2 * 2) = 24/4 = 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient I found, 6, is just part of the expansion. Now, I need to consider the entire expression. However, since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which involves c terms. \n\nBut wait, \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve c or 1/c, so when I multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part doesn't affect the a and b terms, maybe I just need to find the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion. \n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions together, the coefficients multiply. So, if I have \\( (a + b)^4 = \\text{something} \\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\text{something else}\\), then when you multiply them, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. \n\nBut since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve c or 1/c, the only way it can appear in the product is if it's multiplied by a term that is \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the term would have a c component. So, in other words, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion, which is 6. \n\nSo, now my problem reduces to finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on that. Again, I can use the binomial theorem for this expansion. \n\nThe binomial expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nI need the term where the exponent of c is 0. So, I set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for k: 6 = 2k => k = 3. So, the term when k=3 is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\). \n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 6! / (3! * 3!) = (720)/(6 * 6) = 720 / 36 = 20. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. \n\nTherefore, going back to the original problem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by 20 from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. When you multiply these two parts, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve c, it only gets multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20. So, the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think that makes sense. Let me just verify with an example. Suppose I set a=1, b=1, c=1. Then, the original expression becomes \\((1 + 1)^4 (1 + 1/1)^6 = 2^4 * 2^6 = 16 * 64 = 1024. Now, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be (1)^2*(1)^2 = 1, and the coefficient is 120, so 120 * (c^0 term) = 120*1=120. But when I plug in a=1, b=1, c=1, the entire expression is 1024, which is much larger than 120. Hmm, that doesn't seem to match. Wait, maybe my approach is wrong. \n\nWait, no, because when a=1, b=1, c=1, the value of the entire expression is 1024, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120, which means that when you expand the whole thing, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by all the c terms would give 120 times something. But when c=1, all the c terms are 1, so the entire term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 120. But in reality, when a=1, b=1, c=1, the entire expression is 1024, which includes all terms, not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that makes sense because 1024 is the sum of all coefficients, but each individual term like \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. So, that seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it another way. The expression \\((a + b)^4\\) has terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\), each with coefficients. Then, when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve c, we just need to find how many times \\(a^2b^2\\) appears when multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. \n\nSo, yes, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's correct. \n\nAnother way to think about it is that the entire expression is the product of two independent expansions. The \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are independent of the \\(c\\) terms.

Using the binomial theorem, we know that the term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is given by:\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Each term's coefficient is given by the binomial coefficient, which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\) where \\(k\\) is the exponent of \\(b\\). So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\), so when I multiply the two expressions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) will just act as coefficients when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, actually, no. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would mean we're just looking for the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is a constant term, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because if we have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), it would result in a term with \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), we need the part where the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, leaving just a coefficient.\n\nSo, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero for the term to be constant, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients we found from each part. That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). That seems correct. Then, for the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The binomial coefficient there is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), which is correct. So, multiplying those together gives 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by multiplying the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

The expansion will have terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\). The general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, when \\(k = 2\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^{2}b^{2}\\). Calculating the binomial coefficient, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\).

Wait, but \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, right? So, the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) shouldn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because they are multiplied by different variables. So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) remains the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, regardless of the other part?\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm oversimplifying. Let me think again. The entire expression is the product of two binomials: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we multiply these two, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the terms from the second binomial will just be constants (with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)) when considering the coefficient.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that's not quite right. Actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we don't need to consider how \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) affect the term. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only contribution to \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the term in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the constant term (with respect to \\(c\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, no, that's not correct either. Because if you think about it, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product will be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), each term in the second expansion is just a scalar multiple, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term is multiplied individually, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would make the coefficient a sum of terms, not a single value. Hmm, maybe I'm confusing something here.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me approach it differently. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\) and is independent of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion. Alternatively, maybe it's just 6 times the entire expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the expansion includes terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). \n\nWait, no, actually, when you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, you can consider that any term in the product that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) must come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by any term from the second part. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but that can't be right because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that seems high. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is when \\(c = 1\\). So, if the second part evaluates to 64 when \\(c = 1\\), then the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, let me confirm this. Let me consider a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{2}{0} = 1\\), and the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\) is \\((1 + 1) = 2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. But actually, expanding \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)\\), the term \\(a^2\\) would be \\(a^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial, not a constant. So, perhaps my initial approach is incorrect because the coefficients in the product are not just multiplied by the sum of coefficients but by each term individually.\n\nWait, so maybe I'm wrong in thinking that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion. Instead, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion, but that would make the coefficient a sum of terms, not a single number. Hmm, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because any other term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) term, making the product have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or similar, which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nYes, that makes more sense. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is the constant term, and then multiply it by 6.\n\nSo, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me confirm this again. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) we take the constant term, which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, to make sure, let me consider the entire expansion. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a^2b^2, and when multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which has terms like \\(c^6, 6c^4, 15c^2, 20, 15/c^2, 6/c^4, 1/c^6\\), the only term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is 20, so 6a^2b^2 * 20 = 120a^2b^2. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nI think that's the correct approach. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) is given by:\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we need to find the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is:\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\binom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe seek the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient of this term is:\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficients from each expansion:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

Well, the original expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So when we multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means we need to find all the terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) can be anything because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms.\n\nWait, but actually, when we multiply the two expansions, the terms from the first expansion are in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), while the terms from the second expansion are in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are different variables, their exponents don't interfere with each other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second.

Let me think again. The product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be the sum over all terms from the first expansion multiplied by all terms from the second. So, each term in the product is of the form \\(a^{4 - k}b^k \\times c^{6 - m} \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^m}\\) where \\(k\\) and \\(m\\) are integers from 0 to 4 and 0 to 6 respectively. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can set \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). That gives us the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion, which has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, when we multiply this by each term from the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term from the second expansion will have a coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) and a variable part of \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\) because \\(c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nBut wait, since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part (\\(6\\)) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by the corresponding term from the first expansion.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are separate variables. So, actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all distinct, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion.

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me check that again.

Hmm, that seems correct, but let me think if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and any term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

So, as I calculated before, the coefficient from the first part is 6, and the sum of all coefficients from the second part is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem statement just says \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think it's correct that the coefficient is 384, because the other variables can be anything, so all their coefficients contribute.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. Let me compute \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and find the sum of its coefficients. As I thought, substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives 2^6 = 64, so that's correct. Therefore, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial (like \\(a^2b^2\\)) is multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the other polynomial, because each term in the other polynomial will multiply the specific term from the first polynomial, contributing to the total coefficient.\n\nSo, yes, I think 384 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in this expansion can be found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n\\[\n\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\nSince the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we get:\n\\[\n6 \\times 64 = 384\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), I can write it as the sum from k=0 to 4 of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). \n\nWait, so if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that means I need the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. So, in terms of the binomial expansion, that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me check that: if \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. So, the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the expansion of that part as well. However, I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't affect the powers of \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 multiplied by whatever factor comes from the second part? Wait, no, actually, I think I might be misunderstanding. \n\nWait, no, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply them together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), I think that the coefficient will just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Wait, no, that's not possible because the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, so every term will involve both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) raised to some power and \\(c\\) raised to some power.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but the entire expression includes terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, does that mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\)? But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), or is it considering the entire term including \\(c\\)?\n\nWait, no, I think the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), meaning that in the expansion, all terms where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, each such term would be of the form \\(6a^2b^2 \\times\\) [some term from the second expansion]. So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But that doesn't seem right because the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, each of these terms is multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, so if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then it's actually \\(6 \\times\\) the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible terms, but that would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is actually the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, multiplied by 6. \n\nBut that doesn't seem right either. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by other terms. Wait, no, that's not correct because the entire expression is a product, so each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider only the constant term in the second expansion because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without any \\(c\\), so to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, I need to multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the middle term, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^3 \\times (1/c)^3 = \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but now I'm confused because earlier I thought it was 384, but now I'm thinking it's 120. Which one is correct? Let me think carefully. \n\nThe problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the entire product, any term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384. However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) (i.e., the constant term), then it would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nBut the problem statement is: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's a bit ambiguous. However, in most cases, when someone asks for the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\), they're referring to the term that is exactly \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of other variables. So, in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because coefficients are typically constants. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to have the entire expression as a product, and we're to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). \n\nIf that's the case, then I need to find the term where in the first expansion, we have \\(a^2b^2\\), and in the second expansion, we have the constant term. So, the coefficient would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), giving 120. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nLet me verify this. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has a constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when we multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, giving \\(6 * 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part. The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) yields \\(6a^2b^2\\). The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a constant term of 20. Multiplying these coefficients gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n$\\boxed{120}$"

    "text": " So, for each term in the expansion, the exponents of a and b will add up to 4 in this case because it's \\((a + b)^4\\). \n\nSo, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), the exponents of a and b are both 2. That means the term comes from the part of the expansion where the binomial coefficient is when a is squared and b is squared. So, I can find the coefficient by calculating the binomial coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). \n\nThe binomial coefficient is given by \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), because we're choosing 2 a's (or equivalently 2 b's) out of 4. So, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider that when I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). However, I notice that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve c or 1/c at all. That means, when I multiply the expansions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient from the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), right? Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by 1 (the constant term), I get \\(a^2b^2\\), and if I multiply it by any other term involving c or 1/c, it would change the term, but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), we can ignore the terms that have c in them. \n\nSo, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the constant term, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will have terms of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe want the exponent of c to be zero because that's the constant term. So, we set up the equation \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for k, we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). \n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. \n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). \n\nSo, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. \n\nWait, let me double-check that I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Then, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is when the exponent of c is zero, which is when k=3, so that's correct. The binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. That seems right. \n\nI don't think I made any errors in my calculations. So, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{120}\\)"
