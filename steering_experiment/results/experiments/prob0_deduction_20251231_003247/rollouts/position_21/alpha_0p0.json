    "text": " But in this case, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part, and \\(c\\) is in the other. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only affected by the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, and the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), would just contribute a coefficient, which when multiplied by the 6 from \\(a^2b^2\\), would give the overall coefficient. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, maybe the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and when we multiply them, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would mean that the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the \\(c\\) expansion would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing their coefficients to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, when you expand \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion would be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\), right? So, that simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as I found earlier. So, for \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the \\(c\\) part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would mean that the exponent of \\(c\\) must be zero. So, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient from the \\(c\\) part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient from the \\(c\\) part is 20. Therefore, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients from both parts, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but that seems a bit too straightforward. Let me double-check. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that contributes is when \\(m = 3\\), which gives \\(c^0\\) or 1, with coefficient 20. So, when you multiply these together, you get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. That makes sense because each term in the expansion is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficients multiply.

    "text": " But in this case, \\((a + b)^4\\) is being multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is another polynomial. However, since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can consider that term separately because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6 times whatever the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is? Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by every term in the second. But since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing to the overall coefficient. But wait, actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, effectively adding their coefficients together. So, if I can find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then I can multiply that by 6 to get the final coefficient. How do I find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)? Well, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\). So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) isn't a polynomial in the usual sense because of the \\(1/c\\) term, which introduces negative exponents. So, does the sum of coefficients still apply by plugging in \\(c = 1\\)? Let me think. When \\(c = 1\\), \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\), which would indeed give the sum of all coefficients, considering that each term in the expansion is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\) where \\(k\\) can be negative. So, yes, substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives the sum of all coefficients. Therefore, the sum is 64, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, but let me double-check this approach. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about it differently. Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other terms involve \\(c\\), which are separate variables, maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Wait, no, actually, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in the product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Alternatively, maybe I can approach it another way. Let me consider the entire expression: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6*64=384. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two expansions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), we need to consider the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in that expansion will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing their coefficients. So, again, that sum is 64, so 6*64=384. Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of two generating functions. The generating function for \\((a + b)^4\\) is giving me the coefficients for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the generating function for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is giving me coefficients for \\(c\\). But since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) coefficient and the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) part. So, yes, 6*64=384. I think that makes sense. So, I think the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm not missing something. Another way to think about it: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product will come from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nBut wait, another thought: maybe I should consider that \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has terms with positive and negative exponents of \\(c\\). So, when I multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will contribute a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64. So, 6*64=384. Therefore, I think 384 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two polynomials. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) because that's the term where the exponents cancel out. Wait, is that right? Let me check. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the term where the exponent is 0 is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k=3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would be 6*20=120. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, does that mean I need to consider all possible \\(c\\) terms, or only the constant term? Hmm, that's a good point. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), that would mean adding up all the coefficients from each term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some \\(c^k\\). So, that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Therefore, the coefficient is 6*64=384. But wait, earlier I thought the constant term was 20, so if I only consider the constant term, the coefficient would be 6*20=120. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, I think the correct approach is to consider all terms, hence 6*64=384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, yes, it's 6 times the sum of coefficients in the \\(c\\) part, which is 64, so 384. Therefore, I think the answer is 384.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure. Let me consider an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Let's compute this. \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\). Multiplying them together: \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, but according to my earlier logic, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient in \\((a + b)^2\\) times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\). The sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\) is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^2\\) is zero because the highest power is \\(a^2b^0\\) and \\(ab^1\\). Wait, so that suggests that my earlier approach might be flawed. Because in this example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero, which is correct, but according to my method, it would be 0 * 2 = 0, which is correct. Hmm, maybe it's okay. Let me try another example. Let's say \\((a + b)^3 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). \\((a + b)^3 = a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3\\). \\((c + 1/c)^2 = c^2 + 2c*(1/c) + (1/c)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). Now, the product is: \\(a^3c^2 + a^3*2 + a^3/c^2 + 3a^2b c^2 + 3a^2b*2 + 3a^2b/c^2 + 3ab^2c^2 + 3ab^2*2 + 3ab^2/c^2 + b^3c^2 + b^3*2 + b^3/c^2\\). Now, looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). In this product, the only term with \\(a^2b^2\\) would be from \\(3a^2b*2\\), which is 6a^2b, but wait, that's \\(a^2b\\), not \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product because the highest power in \\((a + b)^3\\) is \\(a^3\\), so when multiplied by the \\(c\\) terms, it's still not \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is zero. According to my method, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{3}{2} = 3\\), and the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^2\\) is \\(1 + 2 + 1 = 4\\). So, 3*4=12. But in reality, the coefficient is zero. Hmm, that's a problem. So, my method is giving the wrong answer in this case. Therefore, my approach must be incorrect. So, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, in this example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because there is no such term in the expansion. But according to my method, I'm multiplying the coefficient from \\((a + b)^n\\) times the sum of coefficients in the other polynomial, which gave me 12, but the actual coefficient is zero. Therefore, my method is flawed. So, I need to rethink this.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is not to multiply the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) by the sum of coefficients in the other polynomial, but instead, since the variables \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\) are independent, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by the constant term \\(c^0\\) from the second polynomial to give the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean we need to consider all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\)? Or only the constant term?\n\nWait, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". In the context of polynomials, when you have multiple variables, the coefficient of a specific term is the coefficient when all other variables are considered as coefficients. So, in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the product, and it can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the \\(c\\) terms multiplied by the coefficient from \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial. Wait, but in the example I did earlier, that approach gave the wrong answer. So, perhaps I need to clarify.\n\nWait, in the example, \\((a + b)^3 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be zero because there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. However, according to my method, I thought it would be 3 * 4 = 12, which is wrong. So, perhaps the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is to multiply by the constant term. So, in the example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 3 * 20 = 60, but in reality, there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term because in \\((a + b)^3\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero. Wait, no, in \\((a + b)^3\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b\\) is 3, and \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero. So, perhaps the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so to get it, you need to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial by the constant term from the second polynomial. So, in the example, \\((a + b)^3\\) has no \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient is zero, which matches the actual result. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, in this problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. But wait, in my earlier example, when I used the sum of coefficients, it gave me the wrong answer, but using the constant term gave me the correct answer. So, perhaps the correct approach is to use the constant term.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). So, that would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But in my earlier example, that approach gave me the wrong answer. So, perhaps the problem is that when you have multiple variables, the coefficient of a specific term is the coefficient when all other variables are set to their respective exponents. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial by the entire second polynomial, which would give terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). Therefore, it's the coefficient from the first polynomial times the sum of coefficients from the second polynomial. So, in the example, \\((a + b)^3\\) has no \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient is zero, regardless of the second polynomial. But in the given problem, \\((a + b)^4\\) does have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 384. But in my earlier example, when I multiplied \\((a + b)^3\\) by \\((c + 1/c)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because there is no such term, which aligns with the fact that the coefficient from the first polynomial is zero. So, perhaps my initial approach was correct, and the confusion came from the example where the coefficient was zero. So, in this problem, since the coefficient from the first polynomial is 6, and the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, because when you multiply, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is to multiply by the constant term. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so that would include all powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is the product of the coefficients from each polynomial, but since the variables are independent, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps the correct interpretation is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in the example, when I did \\((a + b)^3 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial, regardless of the second polynomial. So, the approach of multiplying the coefficients times the sum of the coefficients of the other polynomial seems to work when the term exists in the first polynomial. So, in this problem, since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) exists in the first polynomial, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 384. Therefore, I think the answer is 384.\n\nBut let me confirm with another example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\). The product is \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because there is no such term. According to my method, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^2\\) is zero for \\(a^2b^2\\), so the product is zero, which is correct. If I use the sum of coefficients approach, the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\) is 2, and the coefficient from \\((a + b)^2\\) is zero, so 0 * 2 = 0, which is correct. If I use the constant term approach, the constant term in \\((c + 1/c)\\) is 2, and the coefficient from \\((a + b)^2\\) is zero, so 0 * 2 = 0, which is correct. So, both methods give the correct answer in this case.\n\nAnother example: \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 384. Alternatively, it's 6 times the constant term, which is 20, so 120. But wait, which one is correct? Let me think. If I expand \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by the coefficient from the first polynomial. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. But if I only consider the constant term, it's 6 * 20 = 120, which would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but in the example I did earlier with \\((a + b)^3 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero, which is correct. But if I use the sum of coefficients approach, I get 3 * 4 = 12, which is wrong. So, perhaps the correct approach is to use the constant term. Because in that example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 3 * 2 = 6, but since there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term, it's zero. Wait, no, in that example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is zero, so the product is zero, regardless of the second polynomial. So, perhaps the correct approach is to take the coefficient from the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial, but since the coefficient is a number, it's the coefficient from the first polynomial times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial. Therefore, in this problem, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think I'm getting confused because the problem is about multiple variables. Let me try to think of it in terms of generating functions. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum over all \\(k\\) of (coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) in the product). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any \\(c^k\\). Therefore, it's the coefficient from the first polynomial times the sum of coefficients from the second polynomial. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial, which would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 384. Therefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). So, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The expansion is \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero. According to my method, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^1\\) is zero for \\(a^2b^2\\), so 0 * 2 = 0, which is correct. If I use the constant term approach, the constant term in \\((c + 1/c)\\) is zero, so 0 * 0 = 0, which is correct. So, both methods work in this case.\n\nAnother example: \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). \\((c + 1/c)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). The product is \\(a^2c^2 + 2a^2 + a^2/c^2 + 2ab c^2 + 4ab + 2ab/c^2 + b^2c^2 + 2b^2 + b^2/c^2\\). Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because there is no such term. According to my method, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^2\\) is zero for \\(a^2b^2\\), so 0 * 4 = 0, which is correct. If I use the constant term approach, the constant term in \\((c + 1/c)^2\\) is 2, so 0 * 2 = 0, which is correct.\n\nWait, but in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero, which is correct. So, my method works here.\n\nAnother example: \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, the constant term in the second polynomial is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. But which one is correct? Let me think. If I set \\(c = 1\\), the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 2^6 = (a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, that suggests that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Alternatively, if I set \\(c = 1\\), I get the sum of coefficients in the \\(c\\) part, which is 64, and multiplying by the coefficient from the first polynomial gives 384. Therefore, I think that is the correct approach.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) by substituting \\(c = 1\\), yielding \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these results gives the final coefficient as \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Wait, no, that's not correct because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are variables, so their expansion will produce terms with different powers of \\(c\\). However, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and any term from the second part, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way for \\(a^2b^2\\) to appear in the product is if it's multiplied by a term that's a constant, i.e., \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the term would involve \\(c\\) as well. So, actually, I think I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because that's the only term that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) would result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times a constant. So, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term with \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by 20 from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Since we're multiplying these two expressions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can only get that term when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second expression. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, if I think about expanding the entire product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part can only combine with the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) in the second part, which is 20, so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I made a mistake here. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Wait, but actually, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), does that mean that the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will just be multiplied by 1, or maybe the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out? Hmm, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we multiply these two, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can treat the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part as a single term, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that can't be right because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has multiple terms, each with different powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps I need to find the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\). Wait, but no, because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a separate term, so when you multiply by \\((a + b)^4\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that we need is the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. Because if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the result would have \\(c\\) terms, which are not part of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by the coefficient from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). That makes sense because the constant term in the second expansion would just be a number, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would give a term that's \\(a^2b^2\\) times that number, so the coefficient would be 6 times that constant term. So, let me try that approach. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we found to be 6. Next, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the constant term, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. Multiplying them gives 120. That seems correct.

But that seems a bit off because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider how that term is affected by the multiplication. Wait, actually, no.

Let's apply the binomial theorem again to this expression. \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\cdot c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\).

Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me check that again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Now, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will multiply each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second polynomial has a coefficient that, when multiplied by 6, contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\). But since the problem doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, as I thought earlier. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient being 6 times each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on \\(c\\), it's actually the entire sum. So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then I would have to find the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and multiply it by 6. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms, I think the correct approach is to consider the entire expansion of the \\(c\\) terms, hence multiplying by 64. So, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Each term in this expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\n3. **Determine the coefficient contribution:**\n   Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to multiply the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Setting \\(c = 1\\) gives:\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n5. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

So, actually, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), it remains \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me confirm that. So, if I write the product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But we're only interested in the terms where the result is \\(a^2b^2\\), which means that the \\(c\\) part must be \\(c^0\\). Therefore, I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\). So, let's find that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the constant term. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients we found from each part. So, that's 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I made any calculation errors here. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs when \\(m = 3\\), giving a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3.

But wait, that doesn't seem right either. Maybe I should think of it differently. Let me denote \\(X = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(Y = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then the product is \\(X \\times Y\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(X\\), and since \\(Y\\) doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(X\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(Y\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(Y\\). But that's not correct because we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(X\\), and when multiplied by any term in \\(Y\\), it would still be \\(a^2b^2\\) times something involving \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, that can't be. Because in the product, each term from \\(X\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(Y\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\(X\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(Y\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply that we are looking for the coefficient when the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the term in \\(Y\\) that is 1, i.e., the constant term. Because if we have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by, say, \\(c^3\\), that would be \\(a^2b^2c^3\\), which is a different term. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(X\\) multiplied by the coefficient of the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) in \\(Y\\). Because that's the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, I think I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(X\\), which is 6, and then multiply it by the coefficient of the constant term in \\(Y\\), which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\): \\(6 = 2k\\) => \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from \\(X\\) times the constant term from \\(Y\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me double-check that. So, in \\(X = (a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(Y = \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when you multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\(X\\) is multiplied by 20, giving 20a^2b^2, and all other terms in \\(Y\\) would result in terms with \\(c\\) exponents, which we don't want. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me think again: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply, but in this case, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is in one part, and the constant term is in the other.

But that seems too simple, and the problem includes the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part, so I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the product, but when multiplied by other terms, it will have other factors involving \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Oh, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But that seems a bit odd because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), so each term would have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe it's considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is raised to some power. But that would mean that the coefficient would include all the possible terms from the second part, which seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that we need to sum over all possible coefficients from the second part. Wait, that might make sense. Let me think: when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't seem right because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning that we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) times 1, and we need the coefficient of that term in the entire product. That makes more sense. So, in other words, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, that would involve finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me confirm that. If we have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the product would be the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, we need to find the term in the second expansion where \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., \\(c^k \\times c^{-k} = 1\\). So, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the answer should be 120. Let me just go through that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\) for \\(m\\) from 0 to 6. We need the exponent to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient there is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Yeah, that seems right. I think I got it.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both parts:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interfere with the terms involving \\(c\\).

Wait, but that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term is just \\(a^2b^2\\) times whatever comes from the other expansion. Wait, no, because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which has powers of \\(c\\). So, the resulting terms would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) can be various exponents. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that we're looking for all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because each term would have both \\(a\\) and \\(c\\) parts. But actually, the question is only about \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps the exponent of \\(c\\) can be anything, and we just need the sum of coefficients from all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present. Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check that again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a numerical coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Wait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the entire expression, we're looking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). So, that term would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I thought before, the sum of the coefficients is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me think again. Is that correct? Let me take a step back. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion comes with a coefficient of 6, and it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum over all \\(k\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), because each term in the second expansion contributes its own coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the result is a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum all the coefficients from the second expansion. So, that sum is indeed \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me verify this with another approach to make sure I'm not making a mistake. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Since the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), its sum of coefficients is indeed \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider specific values. Let me set \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), \\(c = 1\\), and evaluate the expression. Then, the value would be \\((1 + 1)^4 \\times (1 + 1)^6 = 2^4 \\times 2^6 = 16 \\times 64 = 1024\\). Now, if I set \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), \\(c = 1\\), then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 1, and its coefficient would contribute to the total sum. But wait, that approach might not directly give me the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the expression as a product and consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check by expanding both parts. Let's see, \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Now, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so it's \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient times \\(c^k\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, yes, 6 times 64 is 384. I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to write out the entire product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which are all the terms of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. That seems to make sense.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial. Since the first coefficient is 6 and the sum of the coefficients in the second is 64, the result is 6 * 64 = 384. That seems consistent.\n\nI think I'm confident that the coefficient is 384. So, the final answer is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem and properties of polynomial multiplication.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives:\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would mean that the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) must be the constant term, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because otherwise, the product would involve \\(c\\) terms, which we don't want. So, perhaps I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\). That sounds right. So, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.

So, the key idea is that when you multiply two expressions together, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each factor.

So, when you multiply, each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by each term in \\((a + b)^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's correct because maybe I'm misunderstanding how the multiplication works. Let me try another approach. Let's consider the entire product: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. The sum of coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient being 6 times each term in the second expansion, but that would complicate things. No, I think the first approach is correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, we consider the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives the final coefficient as \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{384}\n\\]"

Wait, no, that's not quite right.

Therefore, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Now, how do I find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)? Well, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64.

Because each term in the second part contributes a coefficient that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we can sum all those contributions. So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384. Alternatively, I can think of it as the product of the coefficients from each part, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so the coefficients multiply.

Wait, but that can't be right because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would contribute a coefficient, and when multiplied by 6, each would give a term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\).

So, actually, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that might not be correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand this product, each term will be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term in \\((a + b)^4\\), that term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). Now, when we multiply this by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each of those terms will have the form \\(C \\times c^k\\), where \\(C\\) is the coefficient from the binomial expansion. So, the product will be \\(6a^2b^2 \\times C \\times c^k\\). Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be \\(6C\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), perhaps we need to sum over all possible \\(k\\), but that seems odd. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the problem is considering the entire expression, and we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the expanded form, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing 6 times each coefficient. But that seems a bit off. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because each term would have a different power of \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by all possible \\(c\\) terms, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to compute that. The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting 1 for all variables. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in that expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems high. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it because the problem might just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which isn't a single number. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem just says \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But as I calculated earlier, that sum is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, meaning \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by 6. Let me try that approach. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 20, which is 120. That seems more reasonable. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without any \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the answer would be 120. Let me check that again. The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives \\(c^0\\) term with coefficient 20. So, when we multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120.

That seems more plausible. So, let me break it down: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the term in \\((a + b)^4\\) which is \\(6a^2b^2\\). Now, when we multiply this by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we get \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a separate term, so when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each of those, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) would be \\(6 \\times\\) the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on \\(c\\).

So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would depend on the power of \\(c\\), and the problem didn't specify. So, I think that's the right approach. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Let me double-check my calculations. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 * 20 = 120.

Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), so when we multiply it by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion.

So, yes, I think that's correct. Therefore, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term.

But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, but that's not possible unless \\(k = 0\\), meaning the term from the second expansion is a constant term. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because that's the only way the product would result in a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. That makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I've already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, multiplying this by the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, we get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives 20 for \\(c^0\\). So, when you multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, but only the term with \\(c^0\\) will result in a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms will have some power of \\(c\\), so they won't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. I think that's correct. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed when \\(k = 2\\), so \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). That seems right. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs at \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that since the two parts are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the product of the coefficients from each part, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, yeah, I think 120 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n\\[\n\\text{Coefficient of } a^2b^2 = \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\).

    "text": " But since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient from the \\(c\\) part is just 1? Wait, that might not be right. Let me think again. Wait, no. Actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) by the constant term (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term involving \\(c\\), it would result in a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is not what we want. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me figure that out. So, again, using the binomial theorem for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it can be expanded as \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, that's 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which happens at \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. Yeah, that seems correct. I don't think I made any errors in the calculations. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"
