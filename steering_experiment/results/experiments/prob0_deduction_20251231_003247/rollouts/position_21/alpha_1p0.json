    "text": " So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the only way that can happen is if the term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 1, because \\(a^2b^2\\) times 1 is still \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because that's the only term that won't introduce any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, first, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The exponent on \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the exponent to be zero for the term to be constant. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Let me think again. So, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). We are looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, when we multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\), which has coefficient 6, and then it's multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but that's not correct because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) terms, each with different exponents of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). Hmm, so maybe I need to consider all terms where the product results in \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without any \\(c\\), so the only way that can happen is if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), then we would have to consider the specific term where \\(c^k\\) is multiplied, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), the only term that contributes is the constant term. So, I think my initial thought was correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I have to consider that this term comes from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) and some term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is a scalar coefficient multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), and when you multiply it by the other expression, it's like scaling the entire expression by that coefficient. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't sound right because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a monomial, so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in that expansion, you're effectively scaling \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those coefficients. But since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) contributes a factor that's just the sum of its coefficients. Wait, but actually, no, because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a term involving powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term would be \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) (some term in \\(c\\)). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term in the \\(c\\) expansion will just scale \\(a^2b^2\\) by their respective coefficients. Therefore, the coefficient we're looking for is 6 (from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, how do I find the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Well, the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but let me double-check that. Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4 = \\sum \\text{terms}\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum \\text{terms}\\), then the product is \\(\\sum \\text{terms from first} \\times \\sum \\text{terms from second}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expression, each term contributes its coefficient to the product. So, yes, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but let me think again. Is the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) really 64? Let me expand it a bit. Alternatively, maybe I can compute the sum of the coefficients another way. The expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so yes, that's \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, that part is correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. So, when you multiply the two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expression is multiplied by every term in the second expression, each contributing their own coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the final answer should be 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by evaluating it at \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these results gives the final coefficient as \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)? Wait, no, that's not correct either. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second.

But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not the entire expression. So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply by 6, you're scaling the entire expansion. But wait, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384? Hmm, let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient, not the entire term, perhaps it's just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As I thought earlier, the sum of coefficients is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply as well. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the coefficient of any term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is just a number, so when you multiply 6 by each of those coefficients, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times any term in the other expansion is 6 times that coefficient. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the other expansion. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to treat the entire expression as a product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by \\(c^0\\) to make the term \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, that would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) for \\(c^0\\). So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), \\(6 = 2k\\) so \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but that was when I considered multiplying by the sum of all coefficients. But now, I'm getting 120, which seems more accurate because we're specifically looking for the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, I think 120 is the correct answer. Let me just double-check. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. The term \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) comes from \\(k=3\\) with coefficient 20. Multiplying them together gives 6 * 20 = 120.

Next, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which occurs when \\(k = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, so perhaps it's considering the entire expression, and \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the expansion, but it's multiplied by some terms from the \\(c\\) part. So, the coefficient would include the terms from both expansions. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to take the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion.

But that seems like it's not the case because the question is probably expecting a single numerical coefficient. Wait, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems odd because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which as I thought earlier is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But let me check that again. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, if I take 6 * 64, that's 384. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach because when you multiply two polynomials, each term multiplies each term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) is only one term, so when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient becomes 6 times the entire expansion, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a number.

But I'm not entirely confident. Let me think differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial.

But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. I'm getting confused here. Let me try another approach. Maybe I should expand both parts separately and then multiply them. So, first, \\((a + b)^4\\) expands to \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the expansion will have terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\) in steps of 2. Now, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me check that again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and then the second part is also multiplied, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to treat the entire expression as a product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it and the answer is simply 6, but that seems unlikely because the second part is also being multiplied. Wait, no, because the second part is a separate factor, so when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're just looking for the coefficient, which is a number, I think the answer is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to realize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the rest is irrelevant because the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't seem right because the product would involve \\(c\\) terms as well. Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be 6 times the expansion of the second part, but since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, perhaps it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the answer is simply 6 because the second part is a separate factor, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest is about \\(c\\). But that seems incorrect because the product would have terms involving both \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the answer is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant. But that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is the product of both parts. So, I think the correct approach is to realize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. When multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{384}"

    "text": " So, if I'm looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), that term comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\) and any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts. Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps I can think of it as the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, but no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), will contribute a factor that's multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe I can consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(\\text{something}\\right)\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because that would make the coefficient depend on \\(c\\), which it shouldn't. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) are in terms of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they would create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that we're considering the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\). That makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let's do that. First, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Therefore, when we multiply the two expressions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"

    "text": " So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term is independent of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that doesn't seem right. Because when you multiply, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from the other expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because any other term in the second expansion would bring in a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, which would make the overall term have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something, which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find two things: 1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found as 6. 2. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, I multiply these two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term: \\(c^{6 - k} \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^k} = c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\): \\(6 = 2k\\) \u21d2 \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the two coefficients I found: 6 and 20. So, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) correctly using the binomial coefficient, which is 6. Then, I considered the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and correctly identified that the term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(k = 3\\), which gives the coefficient 20. Multiplying these together gives 120, which seems correct. I don't think I missed anything here. So, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2.

    "text": " So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider that term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by every possible term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't sound quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the other polynomial. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which doesn't make sense because we're looking for a specific coefficient. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be combined with any term from the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can treat the second expansion as a constant multiplier. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, it will be multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, let me check that. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), so it becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to treat the entire second expression as a constant, but that doesn't make sense because it's a variable expression. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the part involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the rest is just multiplied in, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), so maybe it's just 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense because then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the constant term from the second expansion. So, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the constant term, I can use the binomial theorem again. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, that seems more reasonable. So, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when you multiply the two expressions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (which doesn't involve \\(c\\)) would be 6 * 20 = 120. Let me just verify that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives 6a^2b^2. \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives 20 when c is such that the term is constant. So, when you multiply 6a^2b^2 by 20, you get 120a^2b^2. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Alternatively, if I consider the entire expansion, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's the sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms multiplied by 6. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not specifying any particular \\(c\\) term, maybe it's expecting the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but earlier I thought the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6*64=384. But that's if we're considering all possible \\(c\\) terms. But if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the entire expansion, which would mean 6*(64) = 384. But that seems conflicting with my earlier conclusion of 120. Hmm, maybe I need to clarify what the problem is asking. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". So, in the entire expression, \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. But that seems too large. Alternatively, if the problem is only considering the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero), then the coefficient would be 6*20=120. But the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so I think it's expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, so 6*64=384. Wait, but that seems incorrect because when you multiply polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by each term in the other polynomial. So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. But that seems counterintuitive because the coefficient would then be a number, not a polynomial. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem didn't specify, so maybe I need to assume that it's asking for the coefficient as a polynomial, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would make the coefficient a polynomial. But that seems more plausible. Wait, but the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which is a term, so it's expecting a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. So, perhaps the only way that makes sense is that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). So, in that case, it would be 6*20=120. Hmm, I think that's more likely. Because if you consider the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be combined with any term from the second expansion, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion, which would be 6*(sum of coefficients in the second expansion) = 6*64=384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 6*20=120. Since the problem didn't specify, I'm a bit confused. Let me see if I can find similar problems online or in textbooks. Wait, I think in such problems, when they ask for the coefficient of a specific term without mentioning other variables, they usually mean the coefficient regardless of the other variables. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 6*(sum of coefficients) = 6*64=384. But that seems high, and I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when the entire expression is considered, which would involve multiplying each term from the first expansion by each term from the second. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first expansion, and the second expansion is multiplied in, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term of the second expansion, which would be 6*20=120. I think I need to clarify this. Let me think about the structure of the expression. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, if I expand this, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each of those coefficients gets multiplied by 6. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6*64=384. But that seems like a lot. Alternatively, if the problem is only interested in the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), then the coefficient would be 6*20=120. But the problem didn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so I think it's more likely that it's expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384. Wait, but let me check that again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 = A + B + C + ...\\), where A is \\(a^4\\), B is \\(a^3b\\), etc., and the second expansion is \\(D + E + F + ...\\), where D is \\(c^6\\), E is \\(c^4\\), etc., then when I multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6*(sum of coefficients in the second expansion) = 6*64=384. But that seems like the coefficient is 384, but I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, if the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6*20=120. Since the problem didn't specify, I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384. But I'm not entirely confident. Let me try to see if I can find a similar problem. Suppose we have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be... Wait, no, in that case, \\((a + b)^2\\) has \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because in \\((a + b)^2\\), the highest power is \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\), but there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, maybe that's a bad example. Let me think of another one. Suppose we have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because the first expansion only has \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) to the first power. So, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and when multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. So, 6*64=384. But I'm still not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, making the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem didn't specify any particular \\(c\\) term, so maybe it's expecting the coefficient as a polynomial. But the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which suggests a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only interested in the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), so 6*20=120. I think I need to decide which interpretation is correct. Since the problem didn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should look at the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". It doesn't mention anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's expecting the coefficient as a polynomial, meaning that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient when \\(c\\) is such that the term is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), but without any specific condition, I think the intended answer is 120, considering only the constant term. Therefore, I think the correct answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all possible ways that \\(a^2b^2\\) can come from the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, so when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) would be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a single term, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that can't be right because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a number, not a polynomial. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that means I'm looking for all the terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). Wait, but that's not possible because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every possible term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because then the coefficient would include terms with \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, it's treating \\(c\\) as a variable separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which usually refers to the numerical coefficient, treating all other variables as constants. Wait, but in this case, since \\(c\\) is involved, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But the way the problem is phrased, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Hmm, that's possible. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, and the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part is just a constant factor. But that doesn't seem right because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) does expand into multiple terms. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), meaning the coefficient would be the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too straightforward, and the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider the entire expansion and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but that would mean treating \\(c\\) as a variable and the coefficient would be a polynomial. But perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning the coefficient is a constant, and the \\(c\\) terms are to be considered as part of the coefficient. Hmm, maybe I need to think differently. Let me try to approach this by considering that \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) are separate, so when you multiply them, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are independent of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question, and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all variables, but that would require knowing the specific power of \\(c\\) as well, which isn't specified. Wait, maybe the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), but since the problem doesn't specify a particular power of \\(c\\), perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so that would be \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Hmm, that seems plausible. Let me check that reasoning again. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), which is the sum of all coefficients in that expansion. Therefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by 64, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) becomes \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then considering that it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the overall coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient, not the coefficient times some expression, perhaps the answer is just 6. But that doesn't seem right because the entire expression includes the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part, so the coefficient would be 6 times that expansion. Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would involve considering all possible terms. Wait, but \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems odd because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is just 6, and the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a separate factor. But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from one is multiplied by each term from the other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial, not a single number. Hmm, I'm confused. Maybe I should approach this differently. Let's think about the entire expression: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I expand this, I'll have terms like \\(a^4b^0c^6\\), \\(a^3b^1c^5\\), etc., but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the same as the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not a numerical value, so maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the part \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is just a separate factor that doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term from one polynomial is multiplied by each term from the other. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient, and not expanding further, maybe the answer is 6. Wait, but that seems too simplistic. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would require considering the product. Wait, but without specific powers of \\(c\\), it's impossible to determine a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is just a separate factor. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, the coefficients multiply as well. Wait, no, actually, the coefficients multiply when you multiply terms. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient, perhaps it's expecting the numerical coefficient, which would require evaluating \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) at a specific value of \\(c\\). But the problem doesn't specify, so maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is just a multiplier, so the overall coefficient is 6 times that expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient, maybe it's just 6. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a misprint, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^{10}\\) or something similar, but that's just my assumption. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to recognize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the rest is just additional terms, so the coefficient remains 6. But that seems incorrect because when you multiply by another polynomial, the coefficients get scaled. So, for example, if you have \\( (a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6 \\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\((c + 1/c)^6\\). So, the coefficient is not a single number but a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting me to recognize that and write the coefficient as \\(6(c + 1/c)^6\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to compute the sum of all coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), which would be \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), and then multiply by 6 to get 384. That would make sense if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, i.e., treating \\(c\\) as 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\((c + 1/c)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Let me verify that reasoning. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). That seems correct. Alternatively, if I don't set \\(c = 1\\), then the coefficient is \\(6(c + 1/c)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient, and not specifying a particular power of \\(c\\), perhaps it's expecting 384 as the answer. So, I think the correct approach is to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiply it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, giving 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. To find the overall coefficient when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we note that the sum of the coefficients in the second expression is 64 (when \\(c = 1\\)). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

But wait, that would mean the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which isn't correct because we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not any \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, if I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). Each of these terms is then multiplied by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term comes only from the \\(6a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\). The other terms in \\((a + b)^4\\) when multiplied by anything in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would give terms with higher powers of \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), which we don't want. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just 6 times the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that doesn't make sense because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a term with some power of \\(c\\), but when we multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the expansion. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), I think that means we need to consider all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), and sum their coefficients. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that's not correct because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which would give \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems too high. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me check again.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. But in this case, since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part is in terms of \\(c\\), the exponents of \\(c\\) don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) will give a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each of those terms contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut wait, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384. But let me verify this because I'm a bit unsure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. But since \\((a + b)^4\\) contributes \\(6a^2b^2\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) contributes all its terms, then when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that each term in the product is a combination of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The only term from \\((a + b)^4\\) that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\). Then, when multiplied by each term in the other expansion, which is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\), the coefficient for each of these terms is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\). So, when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the expansion, you get terms like \\(6\\dbinom{6}{k}a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum over all \\(k\\) from 0 to 6 of \\(6\\dbinom{6}{k}\\). Because each term contributes \\(6\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum all these coefficients. So, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k}\\).\n\nBut wait, \\(\\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k}\\) is equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\), because the sum of the binomial coefficients for a given \\(n\\) is \\(2^n\\). So, that means the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have multiple variables, the coefficients can interfere, but in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), their coefficients don't interfere. So, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but only the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Another approach is to consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of the terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the exponents of \\(c\\) in the second polynomial don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about it as follows: The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can treat \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as a single term, say \\(K\\), and then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, so the coefficient in the product would be 6 times \\(K\\). But \\(K\\) is the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the same as substituting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(64\\). So, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if that's the correct approach. If I have two expressions, \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in their product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), each term contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), we sum all those contributions.\n\nSo, I think that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me consider a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). The expansion of \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\). So, the product is \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, that's a different case because in this case, the product would have terms like \\(a^2c\\), \\(a^2(1/c)\\), \\(2ab c\\), etc., but no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, in this case, the coefficient is zero. Hmm, that contradicts my earlier approach because in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero, but according to my earlier logic, it would be 1 (the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in \\((a + b)^2\\)) times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\), which is 2, giving 2, which is not correct. So, my earlier approach must be wrong.\n\nWait, so in this simpler example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because there's no term where both \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) are present in the product. So, that means my initial approach is incorrect. So, perhaps I need a different method.\n\nLet me rethink this. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, perhaps I should consider that when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. But in this case, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those of \\(c\\). So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), you need to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by any term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a scalar (it doesn't involve \\(c\\)), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a scalar. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be a scalar. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But in my earlier example, that approach didn't work because it gave the wrong result. So, perhaps the issue is that in the example, the product doesn't have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, but in the original problem, it does.\n\nWait, in the original problem, \\((a + b)^4\\) does have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be present in the product, but multiplied by each term in the other expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but in my earlier example, the product didn't have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term because \\((a + b)^2\\) only goes up to \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\), and the other term didn't contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps in that case, the coefficient is zero, but in the original problem, it's 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. In the original problem, \\((a + b)^4\\) has an \\(a^2b^2\\) term with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has terms with coefficients \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for \\(k\\) from 0 to 6. So, when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me consider another example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) here is zero because there's no such term. But according to my approach, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^1\\) is zero, so the total coefficient is zero, which is correct. So, in that case, it works.\n\nAnother example: \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). The expansion of \\((a + b)^2\\) is \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). The expansion of \\((c + 1/c)^2\\) is \\(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). The product is \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. According to my approach, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^2\\) is zero, so the total coefficient is zero, which is correct.\n\nWait, but if I take \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^0 = (a + b)^4 \\times 1\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, which matches my approach because the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^0\\) is 1, so 6 * 1 = 6.\n\nSo, perhaps my approach is correct, and in the original problem, the coefficient is indeed 384.\n\nWait, but let me check the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of its coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nSo, after all that, I think the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, since every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) contributes to the coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), we find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) by setting \\(c = 1\\), yielding \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these results gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Wait, but actually, no. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, no, the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, when you expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the product will be a combination of terms from both expansions. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not correct because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of those terms contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. But actually, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a single term, and when multiplied by each term in the other expansion, the result is a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). So, the only way to get a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\) (without any \\(c\\) terms) is if the \\(c\\) part is multiplied by a term that has \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me work on that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and it's multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But we're only interested in the terms where the product results in \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, that means we're looking for the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that is a constant, which is 20. Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, if I think about the entire expansion, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by all terms from the second part, but only the constant term in the second part will result in a term that is \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms.

But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term will come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term (if any) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because otherwise, if you multiply by a term involving \\(c\\), you'd end up with something like \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), which aren't just \\(a^2b^2\\).

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when I multiply those two, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. So, the coefficient is 120. I think that's correct. Let me see if there's another way to approach this.

But that doesn't seem right because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would imply that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second part. Wait, but that's not correct because each term in the second part would have different powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of those would be a separate term. So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that seems odd because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Wait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any mention of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\), and we're to find the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is whatever. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because each term in the second expansion has a different power of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each would be a separate term. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider only the constant term in the second expansion, meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, perhaps I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, and then multiply that by 6. Let me try that approach. So, first, find the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, this would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the term where \\(k = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me confirm that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and then it's multiplied by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20, so indeed, 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that would also be 120. But since it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that's the correct approach because we're considering the term where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) have exponents 2 each, and \\(c\\) is whatever, but in this case, the constant term is the only one that would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, but actually, when you multiply, every term in the second expansion would create a term in the product with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's the sum over all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are numerical. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Let me double-check that. So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when you multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, giving \\(20a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 20 * 6 = 120. Wait, no, actually, I think I made a mistake in the multiplication. Wait, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives a constant term 20. So, when you multiply the two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. Yes, that's correct. Alternatively, if I consider that each term in the product is \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{term from the second expansion}\\), then the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that's not possible because the coefficient is a single number.

Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term in the second expansion that has \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), then the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), which would not be just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the only way to get a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, first, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in the second part is 20. Therefore, when we multiply these two, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, does that make sense? Let me double-check. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and to get a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), we need to multiply it by the constant term from the second part. So, yes, 6 times 20 is 120. I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I should consider whether the second part could contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in any other way, but since the second part is only in terms of \\(c\\), and the first part is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the cross terms wouldn't affect each other. So, the coefficient should indeed be 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is 6, and the second part has 20 as the constant term. So, when you multiply them, you get 6 * 20 = 120, and that's the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, yes, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the binomial coefficients. So, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is indeed 6, because 4 choose 2 is 6. And \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20, because 6 choose 3 is 20. So, 6 * 20 is 120. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire product being \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all variables, the terms are independent. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second part that are constants. Wait, but in this case, the second part only has one constant term, which is 20. So, yes, the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: If I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c), then the product P(a, b) * Q(c) would have terms where each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P is 6, and in Q, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have multiple variables, the cross terms can affect each other, but in this case, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all separate variables, their exponents don't interfere. So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and the constant term from the second polynomial.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using binomial theorem: coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using binomial theorem: find the constant term, which is when exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which happens at \\(m = 3\\), giving coefficient 20.\n3. Multiply these two coefficients: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which happens when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\).

But wait, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by all the terms from the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that seems possible. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But let me check that. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables, and \\(c\\) is another variable, so when expanding the product, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems odd because the problem is probably expecting a numerical value. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because in the product, each term would have a specific power of \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because otherwise, if it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, that would imply that the \\(c\\) terms have canceled out, but that's not necessarily the case. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as separate variables, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have any power of \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is actually a typo and meant to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) or something like that. But assuming that the problem is correct as stated, let me try to proceed. So, if I consider the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then each term in the expansion would be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents for \\(c\\), we get \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we set \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, this coefficient would be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems to suggest that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that \\(c\\) is another variable, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the entire expansion in terms of \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a number. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you'd have \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term from the second expansion, each multiplied by their respective coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me check that. The sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, that seems plausible. Let me make sure. So, the idea is that in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part (which is 64). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient being 6 multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient when considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, but that seems odd. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, but only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that's not possible because the product would have terms with various powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. That makes more sense. So, let me adjust my approach. I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, to do this, I can consider the product of the two expansions. From the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as we found earlier. From the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), because we want the total exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero. So, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, that makes sense. So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but considering the entire expression, including the \\(c\\) terms. So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to multiply the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part with the term \\(c^0\\) from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Let me double-check. From \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). From \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120. I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64, and 6 * 64 = 384. But that was under the assumption that the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which seems unlikely. The more logical interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. So, I think the correct answer is 120.\n\nBut to make sure, let me think again. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, without any restriction on \\(c\\), then the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient. Therefore, it's more reasonable to assume that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, that seems plausible. Let me check again.

So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, and when multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all terms in that expansion. But wait, that can't be right because that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a lot. But maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Wait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, the \\(c\\) part is separate, and the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would just be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not quite right because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, if I have 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like it's not possible because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering the \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't make much sense because the product includes \\(c\\) terms. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) would still be considered as part of \\(a^2b^2\\). But that's not standard. Typically, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term, you need to consider all variables. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), and sum them up? That seems a bit unclear. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the question is considering the entire expression as a product, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a number. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something here. Let me think differently. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) could be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), and the coefficient would be the sum of all those terms. But that seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't seem likely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number. Wait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me check that. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, is that correct? Let me think again. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = 64\\), so the product \\((a + b)^4 * 64\\) would have coefficients multiplied by 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. That seems plausible. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6, but that seems too simple. Wait, but the problem includes both \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the entire product would involve terms with \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some specific power of \\(c\\), but it's not specified. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. That seems reasonable. Let me check that approach. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), so the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the constant term in \\(c\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, let's try that approach. To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by the constant term from the second part. So, first, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that using the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. So, that's 120. Alternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems less likely because usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term, you consider all variables. So, perhaps the intended answer is 120, considering the constant term in \\(c\\). Let me think again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all \\(k\\) of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{k}\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^{-k}\\) in the second expansion. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, each term in the product is of the form \\(a^ib^j c^k\\), so to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), we would sum over all possible \\(k\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in \\(c\\). That would make the coefficient 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), but that would again result in a polynomial, which doesn't make sense for a coefficient. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), so the constant term in \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that. If I have \\((a + b)^4 = 6a^2b^2 + \\text{other terms}\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = 20 + \\text{other terms}\\), then when I multiply them, the term \\(6a^2b^2 * 20\\) would give \\(120a^2b^2\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120. Alternatively, if I consider all possible powers of \\(c\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6*(64) = 384, but that would be if I'm summing over all \\(c\\) terms. But since the problem didn't specify, I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem is written as: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the entire product, each term is of the form \\(a^ib^jc^k\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each possible \\(c^k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is miswritten, or I'm misinterpreting it. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial. But the problem says \"the coefficient,\" which usually refers to a number. So, perhaps the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that would mean the coefficient is 384, which is a number, but it's multiplied by all the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 384, but that seems incorrect because the coefficient should account for the \\(c\\) terms as well.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think about it differently. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, as I calculated earlier, that would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be 6*(64) = 384. But that seems too large, and it's not a standard interpretation.\n\nWait, let me check an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it's \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, that's a bad example. Let me think of a better one. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it's \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, in that case, the coefficient is zero. Similarly, in the given problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, but if the problem is asking for a single number, then perhaps it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients, which is 6*64=384. But that seems inconsistent with standard interpretations.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial. But the problem says \"the coefficient,\" which implies a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in \\(c\\). So, that would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6*(64) = 384. But that seems more like a generating function approach.\n\nWait, but let me think about it again. If I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c), then the product P(a, b) * Q(c) would have terms where each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be P's coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by Q's entire expansion. So, that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it's a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is miswritten, or I'm misinterpreting it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, ignoring the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in Q(c). So, that would be 6*64=384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, perhaps I can look for similar problems online to see how they're interpreted. For example, if I have \\((a + b)^n (c + d)^m\\), and I'm asked for the coefficient of \\(a^kb^l\\), it would typically mean the coefficient of \\(a^kb^l\\) times any power of \\(c\\) and \\(d\\), but in this case, since it's \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64=384.\n\nBut I'm still not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, let me check another approach. Let me expand both parts separately and then see how the coefficients multiply.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\) has terms:\n\n- \\(a^4\\)\n- \\(4a^3b\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2\\)\n- \\(4ab^3\\)\n- \\(b^4\\)\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has terms:\n\n- \\(c^6\\)\n- \\(6c^4\\)\n- \\(15c^2\\)\n- \\(20\\) (constant term)\n- \\(15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., up to \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6*(64) = 384. But that's if we're considering the coefficient as a polynomial. However, if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the constant term in \\(c\\), then it's 6*20=120.\n\nBut the problem didn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384. Alternatively, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about what the problem is asking. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6*(64) = 384. But that's a polynomial, not a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64=384. So, that's a possible interpretation.\n\nBut I think the standard interpretation is that when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term in a product of two expressions, you're supposed to consider the term in the product where the variables match. So, if you're asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), you need to consider all possible powers of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a number, I think the intended interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nTherefore, after all this thinking, I believe the correct answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Wait, so \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the product, but the product also includes terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\).

So, would the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) be 6 * 64 = 384? But that seems too high. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(a^{4 - k}b^k \\times c^m\\), where \\(m\\) can range from -6 to 6 in steps of 2, I think. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from \\(k = 2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), the term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which can't be the case because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each and the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would involve \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero. So, let me proceed under that assumption.\n\nSo, first, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the term in this expansion where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because when I multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), I want the total exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero. So, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is 20.\n\nNow, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the problem might be asking for just \\(a^2b^2\\), without considering \\(c\\), but now I'm assuming it's \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). I think that's the correct interpretation because otherwise, the coefficient would involve \\(c\\) terms, which doesn't make sense in this context. So, I think the answer is 120.\n\nLet me double-check my steps:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That happens when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. Multiply the two coefficients together: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120.\n\nBut wait, the original problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without mentioning \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.

But that would result in a coefficient that's a function of \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are numerical.

    "text": " So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would mean that the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering any specific \\(c\\) terms. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), perhaps the answer is simply 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Oh, wait a second. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the product, and it's multiplied by some term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you'd have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that might mean that we're treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, which is 6, and not considering the \\(c\\) terms because they are separate variables. But that doesn't seem right either because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from one polynomial multiplies each term from the other. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\). Let me check that. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, is that correct? Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would have coefficients from each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, as I calculated earlier, giving 384. But that seems high. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the \\(c\\) terms are separate, so the coefficient is 6. But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply polynomials, each term from one affects the coefficients of the other. I'm getting confused here. Let me try another approach. Let me write out the product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, as established. Now, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But as I calculated before, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. But wait, is that accurate? Because in reality, each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from -6 to 6 in steps of 2, I think. So, when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get terms like \\(6 \\times \\text{coefficient} \\times a^2b^2c^k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check with a smaller example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding \\((a + b)^2\\) gives \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). The expansion of \\((c + 1/c)\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\). Now, the product is \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be 1 * (c + 1/c), so 1*(c + 1/c) = c + 1/c. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2*(c + 1/c), and the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) would be 1*(c + 1/c). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), not just 1. So, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6*(c + 1/c)^6, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is 6*(sum of coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)), which is 6*64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{384}\n\\]"

    "text": " So, if I'm looking for a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would mean that the \\(c\\) terms have to cancel out. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) is if the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel each other out. So, perhaps I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me find that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero. That is, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the constant term from the other part. So, that would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times 20 (the constant term), which is 120. Wait, is that right? Let me double-check. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) has \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a constant term of 20. So, when you multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I should think about it as the product of two independent expansions. So, any term in the product would be a term from the first expansion times a term from the second expansion. So, since I'm only interested in terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, that would come from the first part, and the \\(c\\) terms would have to be the constant term, as any other term would introduce \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which aren't present in \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yeah, I think 120 is the correct coefficient. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is indeed 6, because 4!/(2!2!) = 24/(2*2) = 24/4 = 6. And for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20, because 6!/(3!3!) = 720/(6*6) = 720/36 = 20. So, 6 * 20 is 120. That seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) and identifying the term with \\(a^2b^2\\), which has a coefficient of 6. Then, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found to be 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would mean that any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has a non-zero power of \\(c\\) would result in a term that includes \\(c\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, to get a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\) times a constant (without any \\(c\\) terms), we need the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That way, when I multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), I just get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient, without any \\(c\\) terms. So, let's find that term. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the constant term. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part, and it's being multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but the only term that contributes to a constant (no \\(c\\)) is the term with coefficient 20. So, the total coefficient would be the product of the two coefficients: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times 20 (from the constant term in the \\(c\\) expansion). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) has \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), has a constant term when \\(c^0\\), which is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient there is 20. So, when you multiply the two, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by 20, giving 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes here.
