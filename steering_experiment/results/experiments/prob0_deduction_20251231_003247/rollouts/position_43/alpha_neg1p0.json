    "text": " So, when you multiply these two polynomials together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0\\), which is \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1\\), so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire product being \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so each term in the product is a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) times a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that seems correct. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Another way to think about it is that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, and when you multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial and the constant term in the second polynomial. Any other term in the second polynomial would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) term, which would make the product term have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which isn't what we want. So, yes, it's correct to take the product of the coefficients from each part.

The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). We're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first polynomial, and \\(c\\) is in the second, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial by the \\(c^0\\) term from the second polynomial.
