Hmm, that seems right. But let me think again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Another way to approach this is to consider the entire expression: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can treat the entire \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) as a single term when considering the multiplication. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not correct because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. However, since we're only interested in the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), and no \\(c\\) terms, it must come from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial and the \\(c^0\\) term in the second polynomial.

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. I think that's correct. Let me just make sure I didn't miss anything. The key idea is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial, provided that the variables don't interfere. In this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and the constant term from the second polynomial.
