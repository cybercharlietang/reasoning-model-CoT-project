When you multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\) and not any \\(c\\) terms, we only take the constant term from the second expansion. So, yes, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, but let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). However, since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider all the ways that \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by terms from the second polynomial to still result in a term with \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second polynomial, the result will be \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the only way to get a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\) (without any \\(c\\) terms) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term (c^0) from the second polynomial. So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the answer. But just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me go through it again. First part: \\((a + b)^4\\).
