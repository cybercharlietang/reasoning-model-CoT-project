    "text": " But wait, does this account for all the terms? Let me double-check. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. When you multiply these two terms together, you get \\(6 \\times 20 \\times a^2b^2c^0\\), which is \\(120a^2b^2\\). So, that means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but does the multiplication affect the exponents? Let me see: \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives \\(c^0\\), so when you multiply them, the exponents add up, but since \\(c^0\\) is 1, it doesn't change the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, yes, the coefficient is 120. But wait, is there any other term that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. If I take a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that isn't \\(c^0\\), say \\(c^k\\), and multiply it by \\(a^2b^2\\), then the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\), so it doesn't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, only the \\(c^0\\) term contributes, so the coefficient is indeed 120. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two polynomials, and when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to \\(a^2b^2\\). But since the second polynomial doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiply it by the constant term from the second polynomial. So, that's 6 times 20, which is 120. So, I think that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. So, first, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), that's correct. Then, for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent is 0 is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), that's correct too. Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120, which seems right.\n\nSo, I think I've considered all the steps and possible contributions. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.

So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. When I multiply these two polynomials together, the only way to get an \\(a^2b^2\\) term is by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial by the \\(c^0\\) term from the second polynomial. Any other term from the second polynomial would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) term, which would make the product have a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which we're not interested in. So, yes, only the \\(c^0\\) term contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. Therefore, the coefficient should indeed be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, and the term \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20.

That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as the product of two polynomials, and when you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), you can consider the entire expansion. But since the second polynomial only has terms in \\(c\\), the product would have terms that are products of terms from each polynomial. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial and the constant term in the second polynomial, as any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, which isn't present in \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm not missing something. Maybe I should consider that the second polynomial could have terms that, when multiplied by the first, could somehow result in \\(a^2b^2\\) without involving \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because \\(c\\) and \\(a\\), \\(b\\) are independent variables. So, any term involving \\(c\\) would have to be multiplied by a term without \\(c\\) to get a term without \\(c\\), but since the first polynomial only has \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by the constant term in the second polynomial. So, yes, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me consider an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). And \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). Now, when I multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, \\(6a^2b^2 \\times c^6 = 6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 6c^4 = 36a^2b^2c^4\\), and so on. But the only term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is when it's multiplied by the constant term 20. So, \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 120a^2b^2\\). All other terms would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, so they don't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm interpreting the problem correctly. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering any \\(c\\) terms. So, yes, only the term where the \\(c\\) exponent is zero contributes. So, I think my reasoning is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials and then look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get it is by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial by the constant term from the second polynomial. So, that's 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but maybe I should consider that the second polynomial could have terms that, when multiplied by the first, could somehow result in \\(a^2b^2\\) without involving \\(c\\). But that's impossible because the second polynomial only has terms in \\(c\\), so any term from it would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, except for the constant term. Therefore, only the constant term can contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term when multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, correct. And \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20, correct. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Yes, that seems right.\n\nSo, I think the final answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

For instance, does the term \\(a^2b^2\\) interact with any other terms in the second polynomial? But since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, and any other term in the second polynomial would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) term, which would make the product have a \\(c\\) term, but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), those terms don't contribute.

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility that when I expand both polynomials, some terms might combine in a way that affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? For example, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and, say, \\(c^3\\) from the second part, would that affect the coefficient? No, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^3\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^3\\), which is a different term. Since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is by multiplying it with the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient remains 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, and when you multiply them, the coefficients of the resulting terms are the products of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, for \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient comes from taking the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, as any other term in the second part would introduce a \\(c\\) term, which we don't want in the final product. Therefore, the total coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me check if I made a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. That's correct. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when the exponent is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. So, 6 * 20 is 120. That seems right.\n\nWait, but another thought: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, if I have two terms, one from each polynomial, their product contributes to the coefficient of the term that's the product of their variables. But in this case, since one polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other is in \\(c\\), the variables are separate. So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term in the second polynomial, you get a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), where \\(k\\) is some exponent. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would only occur when the second term is \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, you'd have an extra \\(c\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed the product of the two coefficients, 6 and 20, which gives 120.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term in the second part, because any other term in the second part would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) term, which would make the product have a \\(c\\) term, but we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient is the product of the coefficients of these two terms, which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but in reality, when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would actually be multiplied by all terms in the second polynomial, leading to \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would require \\(k = 0\\), so only the constant term. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should think in terms of generating functions. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum over all possible ways to get \\(a^2b^2\\) by multiplying terms from each polynomial. But since the first polynomial has \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first and \\(c^0\\) from the second. Therefore, the coefficient is the product of the two coefficients, which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem specifically says \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms, so \\(k = 0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me think about the variables. The original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from -6 to 6 in steps of 2. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, no. Wait, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which in the context of the entire expression would include any power of \\(c\\). Wait, but that can't be, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the constant term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, in the entire expression, which includes \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients where the product term has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But actually, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a monomial in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and in the product, each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial by \\(c^0\\) from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about the entire expansion and see if there's another way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear, but I don't think so because the second polynomial doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the first polynomial, and it has to be multiplied by a term from the second polynomial that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), which is only the constant term. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me consider an alternative approach. Suppose I treat the entire expression as a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But since the second polynomial is in \\(c\\), it doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Wait, no, that's not correct because the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has terms with different powers of \\(c\\). But when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term in the second polynomial will create a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), where \\(k\\) is the exponent from the second polynomial. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, i.e., the constant term. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think of it this way: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms in each polynomial that multiply together to give that specific term. In this case, the specific term is \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the first polynomial, \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6. In the second polynomial, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term that would allow \\(a^2b^2\\) to remain as \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is the constant term, which has a coefficient of 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and when you expand it, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by the constant term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me check with specific examples. Let's say I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). And \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). Now, when I multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will multiply each term in the second polynomial, giving \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(4a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(20a^2b^2\\), and so on. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 20 times \\(a^2b^2\\), because that's the only term that doesn't have any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) terms. So, the coefficient is 20 * 6 = 120.\n\nWait, but in the expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. So, when you multiply these two terms together, you get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the answer is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about the problem as two separate expansions and then combining the coefficients. Since the variables are independent, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients from each expansion that contribute to that term. So, from the first expansion, it's 6, and from the second, it's 20, so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing any other contributions. For example, could there be a term in the second polynomial that, when multiplied by a term in the first polynomial, gives \\(a^2b^2\\) without involving \\(c\\)? But the second polynomial only has \\(c\\) terms, so the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) is to multiply by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. Therefore, the only contribution is from the constant term in the second polynomial, which is 20. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the contributions from each part of the product.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\).

Let's consider the entire expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) as 6\\(a^2b^2\\).

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the constant term of the second expansion, which is 20, so 6*20=120.

No, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all, so any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has a non-zero exponent of \\(c\\) would result in a term that has \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which wouldn't be part of \\(a^2b^2\\).

So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as we found earlier, and the exponent on \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the exponent on \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, that's consistent with what I thought earlier.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused. Is the second polynomial being multiplied, so does that mean that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms? So, in other words, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term of the second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would require that the term from the second polynomial is 1 (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), as any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), making the product term have \\(c\\) in it, which we don't want. So, yes, only the constant term from the second polynomial contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). When I multiply them, the resulting polynomial will have terms like P's terms multiplied by Q's terms. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) will be multiplied by each term in Q(c), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where k is the exponent from Q(c). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms, that would actually be the sum of all coefficients in Q(c) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply P(a, b) by Q(c), each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) is multiplied by each term in Q(c), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q(c). Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So, perhaps I was wrong before. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, actually, if you have P(a, b) * Q(c), and you want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then you're looking for all terms in the product where the exponents of a and b are 2, regardless of the exponent of c. So, that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q(c). Because each term in Q(c) is a coefficient times a power of c, so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in Q(c), you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient times \\(c^k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q(c). Wait, but that's not correct because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible terms where the exponents of a and b are 2, regardless of the exponent of c. But in reality, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in Q(c), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q(c). But wait, that would be if you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c, but in the problem, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any c terms. So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) and the constant term in Q(c), because any other term would have a c or 1/c, making it \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is not \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in Q(c). So, that would be 6 * 20 = 120, as I thought earlier. So, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure by considering a simpler example. Suppose I have (a + b)^1 * (c + 1/c)^1. The expansion would be (a + b)(c + 1/c) = ac + a/c + bc + b/c. So, the coefficient of a in this product is c + 1/c, but if I'm looking for the coefficient of a, ignoring c terms, that would be the coefficient of a times the coefficient of c^0 in the second polynomial. But in this case, the coefficient of a is 1, and the coefficient of c^0 in (c + 1/c) is 0, because there's no constant term. Wait, but in this case, the product doesn't have a term with a alone, because all terms have either c or 1/c. So, the coefficient of a would be 0. But if I were to compute it as coefficient of a in first poly times coefficient of c^0 in second poly, that would be 1 * 0 = 0, which is correct. So, that seems to check out.\n\nAnother example: Let's take (a + b)^2 * (c + 1/c)^2. Expanding (a + b)^2 gives a^2 + 2ab + b^2. Expanding (c + 1/c)^2 gives c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2. Now, multiplying these together, the term 2ab * 2 = 4ab. So, the coefficient of ab is 4. Alternatively, coefficient of ab in first poly is 2, and coefficient of c^0 in second poly is 2. So, 2 * 2 = 4, which matches. So, that seems correct.\n\nSo, applying that logic back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me consider if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe using multinomial coefficients or generating functions. But I think the approach I took is correct. Alternatively, I could think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all possible products of coefficients from each polynomial that result in \\(a^2b^2\\). But since the second polynomial doesn't involve a or b, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiplying it by the constant term from the second polynomial. So, that gives the same result: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me check one more thing. The second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when does 6 - 2m = 0? When m = 3, as before. So, the constant term is indeed \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's the answer. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning now.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."
