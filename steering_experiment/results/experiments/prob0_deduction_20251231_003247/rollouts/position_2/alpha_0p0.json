    "text": " The same goes for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the question is specifically asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I might not need to fully expand both parts, just focus on the parts that contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nLet me start by looking at the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider how this multiplication affects the term \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the second part is raised to the 6th power, it's a separate expansion. However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). That means that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient remains 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that's not correct either. Let me think again.\n\nActually, when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each factor. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, so it's just the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient will be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, but the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), and when you multiply by it, each term in the first part gets multiplied by each term in the second part. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way that term can appear is if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nThat makes more sense. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from both parts, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiplying them together gives 120. That seems correct. I don't think I made a mistake here. Yeah, I think that's the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For the term \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs when \\(m = 3\\), giving the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Similarly, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can also be expanded using the binomial theorem. But wait, the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I don't need to expand the entire expression, just focus on the parts that contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nLet me break it down. The entire expression is a product of two binomials raised to powers: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since multiplication distributes over addition, when I expand both, I'll get terms that are products of terms from each expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider the parts of each expansion that contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) and ignore the other terms, right?\n\nSo, first, let's look at \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). I'm interested in the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\).\n\nNow, looking at the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, the expansion is the sum from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nWait a second, but in the problem, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since this second part only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), and the first part is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), when we multiply the two expansions together, the variables involved in each part are independent. That means the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, each contributing some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), I think we just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but actually, no, because the entire expression is a product. So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, each of which has a coefficient and some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's just the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part will contribute a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. Because if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, it's actually the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes its own coefficient, and since we're just interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) term, we can sum all the coefficients from the second expansion and multiply by the coefficient from the first part.\n\nWait, but actually, no, because each term in the second expansion is a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term becomes \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) (coefficient from second part) \\(\\times c^{6 - 2m}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because each coefficient from the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so when you collect like terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the first part's coefficient and the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nBut wait, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is just the value of the expression when \\(c = 1\\), because substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), perhaps I just need to consider that when multiplying the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, each of which has a coefficient. Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all terms would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part.\n\nBut wait, that would be correct if we're considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the product, each term will have the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^{6 - 2m}\\), but we're only interested in the terms where \\(k = 2\\) and \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). But the exponent of \\(c\\) can be anything, so the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, as I thought earlier, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\( (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the problem is looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because otherwise, the term would have some power of \\(c\\), but the problem just says \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, that's a good point. Maybe I misread the problem. Let me check: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but let me think differently. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make more sense, because otherwise, the term would have some power of \\(c\\), and the problem might be implying that we're looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all specified. But the problem as written only specifies \\(a^2b^2\\), not involving \\(c\\). Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes a coefficient. So, the total coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nBut let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would be a specific term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, in that case, we would need to find the term in the second expansion where \\(c^{6 - 2m} = c^0\\), which implies \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Then, the coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient from the second part is 20. Then, the coefficient from the first part is 6, so the total coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but now I'm confused because depending on how I interpret the problem, the answer could be either 384 or 120. Let me try to clarify. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" The phrase \"in\" here could mean that we're looking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384, or it could mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nI think it's more likely that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because otherwise, if it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the product of the first part's coefficient and the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems a bit large, and perhaps the problem expects a more specific term.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so it's possible that it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, that seems high. Let me think of another approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), so that the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, making it a constant term. That would make the problem more interesting, and the answer would be 120.\n\nLet me try to verify this. If I consider the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then from the first part, the coefficient is 6, and from the second part, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), so the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), so the answer would be 120. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to see if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAnother way is to consider that when you multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, each of which has a coefficient and some power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second part multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. So, that would be 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting us to consider that \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, and so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, making the coefficient 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in reality, when you have two separate variables, \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which is a different power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all terms would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384, because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so I think it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, that seems high, and I'm a bit unsure. Let me think about it differently. Suppose I expand both expressions:\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\) has terms up to \\(a^4b^0\\) and \\(a^0b^4\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) has coefficient 6.\n\nSecond, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\), with various coefficients.\n\nWhen I multiply these two expansions, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, each of which has a coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient from the first part (6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part.\n\nThe sum of all coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit confused because I initially thought it might be 120, but now I'm more confident that it's 384. Let me confirm with an example.\n\nSuppose I have a simpler case: \\((a + b)^2 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^1\\) in the first part is \\(\\dbinom{2}{1} = 2\\). The sum of coefficients in the second part is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^1\\) in the product would be \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\). Alternatively, if we were to look for \\(a^1b^1c^0\\), the coefficient would be 2 * 1 = 2, since the term with \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 1.\n\nWait, in this example, if I compute the product:\n\n\\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\)\n\n\\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1 = c + 1/c\\)\n\nMultiplying them together:\n\n\\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\)\n\nNow, looking for the coefficient of \\(ab\\) (which is \\(a^1b^1\\)), regardless of \\(c\\), we have terms \\(2abc\\) and \\(2ab/c\\). Each of these has a coefficient of 2, so the total coefficient would be 2 + 2 = 4, which is indeed \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\), where 2 is from the first part and 2 is the sum of coefficients in the second part.\n\nAlternatively, if we were looking for \\(a^1b^1c^0\\), then we would only have the term \\(2ab\\), but in this case, the product doesn't have such a term because the second part doesn't contribute a \\(c^0\\) term. Wait, actually, in this example, the second part is degree 1 in \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(ab\\), it's either \\(ab c\\) or \\(ab c^{-1}\\). So, there is no \\(ab c^0\\) term, hence the coefficient would be zero. But that contradicts my earlier thought.\n\nWait, perhaps in this example, the coefficient of \\(ab c^0\\) is zero because there's no such term. So, that suggests that in the original problem, if we're looking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then the coefficient would be 120, but if we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's 384.\n\nBut in the example, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) regardless of \\(c\\) is 4, which is the sum of coefficients from the second part (2) multiplied by the coefficient from the first part (2). So, in the original problem, the same logic applies: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients from the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but in my example, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) regardless of \\(c\\) is 4, which is correct because in the product, the terms are \\(2abc\\) and \\(2ab/c\\), each with coefficient 2, so total coefficient is 4. So, that supports the idea that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) is 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then in my example, since there's no such term, the coefficient would be zero, but in the original problem, there is a term where \\(c^0\\), so the coefficient would be 120.\n\nBut the problem as stated is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without mentioning \\(c\\), so I think it's safe to assume that it's asking for the coefficient regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. In the original problem, the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the product will be of the form \\(a^{k}b^{4 - k} \\times c^{m}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from -6 to 6. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present in the product with various powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all coefficients from the second part multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. So, that's 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think the answer is 384.\n\nBut wait, another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, I think the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check once more. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\), which is the sum of all coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and when multiplied by 64, gives 384. So, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it might be 120, but that was under the assumption that we're looking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). But the problem doesn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I think 384 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me think of another example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(ab\\) in the first part is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 2. So, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Indeed, expanding, we get \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The terms with \\(ab\\) are none, but wait, no, that's not correct because the first part is \\((a + b)\\), so the product is \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\), and there are no \\(ab\\) terms. Wait, that contradicts my earlier logic.\n\nWait, so in this case, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be zero because there's no \\(ab\\) term in the product. So, my earlier logic that the coefficient is the product of the coefficients from each part is only valid when the term exists in both parts. Hmm, so perhaps my initial approach is flawed.\n\nWait, that's a problem. In this example, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), there are no \\(ab\\) terms because the first part only has \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) to the first power, and the second part only has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply, you get terms like \\(ac\\), \\(a/c\\), \\(bc\\), \\(b/c\\), but no \\(ab\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is zero, not 1 * 2 = 2.\n\nSo, that suggests that my earlier approach is incorrect. Therefore, I need to rethink this.\n\nWait, so in this case, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is zero, which means that the coefficient of \\(a^kb^{4 - k}\\) in the product is not simply the product of the coefficients from each part, but rather, it's the product of the coefficients only when the exponents align in a way that the variables multiply to give the desired term.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the first part, and when multiplied by any term from the second part, it will result in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^m\\), where \\(m\\) is some exponent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of all coefficients from the second part multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. But in the example I just considered, that approach failed because there were no \\(ab\\) terms, but in that case, the first part didn't have an \\(ab\\) term to begin with.\n\nWait, no, in the example, the first part was \\((a + b)\\), which does have an \\(a\\) and a \\(b\\), but no \\(ab\\) term. So, when multiplied by the second part, which has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), you still don't get an \\(ab\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is zero.\n\nBut in the original problem, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\), which does have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term with coefficient 6. The second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has terms with various powers of \\(c\\). So, when we multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^m\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in the example, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) was zero because the first part didn't have an \\(ab\\) term. But in the original problem, the first part does have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient should be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in the example, if I had \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), then the first part has \\(a^2\\), \\(2ab\\), and \\(b^2\\). The second part has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply, the term \\(ab\\) from the first part is multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), giving \\(abc\\) and \\(ab/c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) in the product is 2 * (1 + 1) = 4, which matches the earlier calculation.\n\nWait, so in that case, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 4, which is indeed the product of the coefficient from the first part (2) and the sum of coefficients from the second part (2). So, in that example, it worked.\n\nBut in the earlier example where the first part was \\((a + b)\\) and the second part was \\((c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(ab\\) was zero because the first part didn't have an \\(ab\\) term. So, the approach works when the term exists in the first part.\n\nTherefore, in the original problem, since the first part has an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, the coefficient in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nSo, I think that's the correct answer. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4-k} b^k\n   \\]\n   We are interested in the term where \\(a^2b^2\\). This occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6-2m}\n   \\]\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives:\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results**:\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of all coefficients from the second part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " The same goes for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to expand the entire expression. Let me think.\n\nSo, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from expanding \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me recall the binomial theorem. The expansion of \\((a + b)^n\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^k\\). So, for \\(n = 4\\), the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) would be when \\(n - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). That means the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider this part as well. But wait, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), does the other part affect it? Hmm, actually, no, because the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) involve \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables. So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion will be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), I think I can treat these two parts separately. That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're just looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient remains 6, and the rest of the expression is multiplied by that. Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again.\n\nActually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when we set \\(c = 1\\), right? So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me check. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that each term in the product will be of the form \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k \\times (1/c)^{6 - k}\\), which simplifies to \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{2k - 6}\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then indeed, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the expansion is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so the coefficient would actually be 6 times each term in the expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's just 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the other expansion.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the product will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As I thought earlier, the sum of the coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm. Let's consider a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 1 (from \\(a^2\\)) times 0 because there's no \\(b^2\\) in the first part, but wait, actually, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't exist because the first polynomial only goes up to \\(b^2\\), but the second is only in \\(c\\). Wait, no, in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) would require multiplying \\(a^2\\) by \\(b^2\\), but the second polynomial doesn't have \\(b\\), so actually, there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. Hmm, so maybe my earlier approach is wrong.\n\nWait, that's confusing. Let me think again. In the original problem, \\((a + b)^4\\) has terms up to \\(a^4\\) and \\(b^4\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has terms up to \\(c^6\\) and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when multiplying, the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all separate. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the product of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the term \\(1\\) (the constant term) from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because any term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will have some power of \\(c\\), but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to consider all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second polynomial.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct either. Because when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which are \\(c^k\\) and \\(c^{-(6 - k)}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should think of it differently. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all products where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first polynomial, and the second polynomial is in \\(c\\), the variables are separate. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nBecause when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me verify this with a smaller exponent to see if it makes sense. Suppose we have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 1 (from \\((a + b)^2\\)) times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\), which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, the coefficient would be 1 * 2 = 2. But let's expand it: \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from \\(a^2 \\times b^2\\), but wait, in this case, the first polynomial is only up to \\(b^2\\), but the second polynomial doesn't have \\(b\\), so actually, there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Hmm, so my earlier reasoning must be flawed.\n\nWait, that's a problem. So, in the smaller case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) should be zero because there's no \\(b^2\\) in the second polynomial. But according to my earlier logic, it would be 1 * 2 = 2, which is incorrect. So, my approach is wrong.\n\nLet me try to understand where I went wrong. The issue is that \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product comes from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) in the second polynomial. Because if you have \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\), that's \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is a different term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is only the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial.\n\nAh, that makes more sense. So, in the smaller example, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 1 (from the first polynomial) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, which is 2 (since \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\), and the constant term is 1, not 2). Wait, no, the constant term is 1, because when you expand \\((c + 1/c)^1\\), you have \\(c + 1/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 0. Wait, that's not right either.\n\nWait, no, \\((c + 1/c)^1\\) is just \\(c + 1/c\\), so there is no constant term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is zero because there's no constant term in the second polynomial. That makes sense because, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would have to be multiplied by 1 to remain \\(a^2b^2\\), but since the second polynomial doesn't have a constant term, the coefficient is zero.\n\nSo, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial. That is, 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's compute that. Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 * 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but that was wrong because I misunderstood how the terms combine. So, the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20, giving 120.\n\nLet me double-check this with the smaller example to make sure. If I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 1 (from the first polynomial) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial. The expansion of \\((c + 1/c)^2\\) is \\(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 2. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 1 * 2 = 2. Let's expand the product: \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2)\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(a^2b^2 * 2\\), so the coefficient is indeed 2. That checks out.\n\nAnother check: If I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 0, because the first polynomial only goes up to \\(ab\\), and the second polynomial has no \\(b\\) terms. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by multiplying the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) (which is 6) by the coefficient of the constant term \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) (which is 20). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

That term is specifically from the first part of the product, \\((a + b)^4\\), right? Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second part, which involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, maybe I don't need to worry about the second part affecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nLet me confirm that. If I multiply two expressions together, the coefficients of the terms in each expression multiply, and the variables combine. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by something else, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will just be multiplied by whatever constant term is in the second part. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nAlright, that makes sense. So, let's tackle each part separately.\n\nFirst, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^n\\) is given by:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^{k}\n\\]\n\nIn this case, \\(n = 4\\), and we want the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, that would be when \\(n - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me check: if \\(n = 4\\), then \\(k = 2\\) because \\(4 - 2 = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the constant term in this expansion because when I multiply it by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, the constant term will just multiply the coefficient, while the other terms will involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables.\n\nSo, how do I find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Again, using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nI need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\):\n\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\\\\n2k = 6 \\\\\nk = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), and the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, is that right? Let me check: 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720 divided by (6 times 6) is 720/36, which is indeed 20. So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the constant term from the second part. So, that's 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)).\n\nCalculating that, 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and I considered only the constant term in the second part. Is there a possibility that other terms could affect \\(a^2b^2\\)? No, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply them, the variables don't interfere. So, any term involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) won't combine with \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) to form another \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, only the constant term in the second part will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nLet me also double-check my calculations. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which happens at \\(k = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120.

    "text": " The same goes for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, I'm only asked about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms at all, right? Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So maybe I can just focus on expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) and find the coefficient there, and then multiply it by whatever comes from the other part, but since I don't need the \\(c\\) terms, maybe the other part just contributes a constant? Hmm, not sure. Let me think.\n\nFirst, let me recall the binomial theorem. It states that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^k\\). So, applying this to \\((a + b)^4\\), each term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so \\(a^2b^2\\). That means \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, what about the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), does this mean that the entire expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will just contribute a scalar multiple when multiplied by \\((a + b)^4\\)? So, perhaps I need to find the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is when I set \\(c = 1\\). Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) into the expression will give me the sum of all coefficients, since each term becomes just its coefficient times \\(1\\) raised to some power, which is 1.\n\nLet me test that idea. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be 6 multiplied by 64, right? Because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since I'm only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and it gets multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the other expression, which is 64.\n\nSo, calculating that, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because when I multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply term by term. But in this case, I'm not just multiplying two polynomials; one of them has variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other has variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with those involving \\(c\\). So, when I look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since I don't care about the \\(c\\) terms, I can just consider the coefficient from the first part and multiply it by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is indeed 64. So, 6 times 64 is 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about it as distributing the multiplication. So, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, the corresponding term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be any term, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient will be the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the other expansion. So, that would again be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, another way to think about it is that when you have two separate polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the other polynomial. So, if I have \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c, 1/c)\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c, 1/c)\\). And the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c, 1/c)\\) is indeed found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives 64.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident that 384 is the correct coefficient.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe I can think about expanding both expressions and see what happens. Let's see, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier.\n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the terms are:\n\n- \\(k=0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0} c^6 = 1 \\times c^6\\)\n- \\(k=1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1} c^4 = 6c^4\\)\n- \\(k=2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2} c^2 = 15c^2\\)\n- \\(k=3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\\)\n- \\(k=4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4} c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(k=5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5} c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(k=6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6} c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the sum of all coefficients is \\(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64\\), which matches what I found earlier by substituting \\(c = 1\\).\n\nTherefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, which is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and it's multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient becomes \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nI think that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\).

I need to expand this as well, but I'm not sure if I need the entire expansion or just specific terms. Wait, since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only comes from the first part, maybe the second part just multiplies the entire expansion by that term. Hmm, but actually, no, because the two parts are multiplied together. So the overall expression is the product of two expansions: one in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). \n\nBut since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\).

But wait, does the second expansion have a constant term?\n\nLet me check. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).

So each term is \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nI need to find the constant term, which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, when I multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part. So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in the first expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in the second expansion, the constant term is 20. Since the two are multiplied together, the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I missed anything because the variables are independent, so the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is to multiply by the constant term from the second expansion.\n\nSo, I think the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can handle each part separately using the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\).

The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^{k}\\). In this case, \\(n = 4\\), so the expansion will be from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(k = 4\\).

I need to expand this as well, but I'm not sure if I need to find a specific term here. Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, does that mean I just need to multiply the coefficient from the first part by the entire expansion of the second part? Or is there something else I need to consider?\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) must be 1, right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so it's like multiplying by 1 in terms of \\(c\\). Hmm, but that doesn't seem right because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a sum of terms involving different powers of \\(c\\).\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand both, we get a product of two sums. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and when we multiply it by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by each term in the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way that happens is if the second part contributes a constant term, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.\n\nSo, to clarify, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when I multiply that by \\(a^2b^2\\), it will result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient, hence contributing to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression.\n\nOkay, so let's work on that. Let me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, it becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, each term has an exponent of \\(c\\) equal to \\(6 - 2m\\). I need the term where the exponent is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term when \\(m = 3\\) is the constant term.\n\nThe coefficient of that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients from both expansions. That is, 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20. So, when we multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, making the coefficient 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nIs there any other term that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product? Let me think. When you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the only way it can come up is by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion by the constant term from the second expansion. So, yes, I think that's the only contribution.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations. For the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me consider if there's any other way \\(a^2b^2\\) could be formed. Suppose I take a term with \\(a^k b^{4 - k}\\) from the first expansion and a term with \\(c^m\\) from the second expansion, then when multiplied together, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) would remain the same, but the exponents of \\(c\\) would change. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way that can happen is if the second term is a constant term, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, yes, my initial reasoning holds.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\):\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n\\[\n\\text{Coefficient} = \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which corresponds to \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) or \\(m = 3\\):\n\\[\n\\text{Coefficient} = \\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from both expansions:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nBut wait, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does this mean that each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) terms. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would include all the \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't make much sense because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that seems too straightforward, and the problem includes both parts, so maybe I'm supposed to consider the entire expression.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when the entire expression is expanded, but since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. So, maybe the problem is actually just asking for the coefficient in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the second part is a distraction. But that doesn't seem right because the problem explicitly includes both parts.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only present in the first factor, and \\(c\\) is only in the second, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\). Therefore, when you multiply the two expansions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that right?\n\nWait, no. Because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second part, which are terms involving \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would mean that the coefficient is the same as in the first part, because each \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then it's just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, including all possible \\(c\\) terms, then it would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial, not a single number.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make much sense because the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", implying a single numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Therefore, I think the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, the answer is 6.\n\nBut I'm not entirely confident. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) or something like that, but it's not specified. So, if that's the case, then we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.\n\nWait, no. Because when you expand \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which are of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each of these, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems like a lot. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficient is just 6, because the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe the answer is 6.\n\nWait, but in the expansion, each term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. So, if we consider the entire expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient in the first part, which is 6.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. But that's not specified in the problem. The problem just says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think it's referring to the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial, but that's not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient from the first part, which is 6.\n\nWait, but that seems too simple, and the problem includes both parts. Maybe I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the same as the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the answer is 6.\n\nBut I'm still unsure. Let me try a different approach. Let's consider the entire expression:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\left(\\sum_{i=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{i}a^{4 - i}b^i\\right) \\times \\left(\\sum_{j=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{j}c^{6 - j}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^j\\right)\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the second sum:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{j=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{j}c^{6 - 2j}\n\\]\n\nNow, when we multiply these two sums together, each term in the first sum is multiplied by each term in the second sum. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(i = 2\\) in the first sum, which has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, this term is multiplied by each term in the second sum, which are \\(\\dbinom{6}{j}c^{6 - 2j}\\) for \\(j = 0\\) to \\(6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the sum over all \\(j\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{j}\\), which is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{j=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{j}\\).\n\nBut \\(\\sum_{j=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{j} = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, so that's different from my earlier thought. So, actually, the coefficient is 384 because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, and we need to sum all those coefficients.\n\nBut now I'm confused because earlier I thought it might just be 6. Let me verify this. So, in the expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes all powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is indeed the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Since the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, that seems correct because each term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by the first part. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nBut let me think again. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), which is the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Therefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by 64, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) becomes 6 * 64 = 384. So, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't consider the \\(c\\) terms, and just looked at the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), it's 6, but when considering the entire expression, each of those 6 terms is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which has 64 terms (when summed). So, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{i=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{i} a^{4 - i}b^i\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(i = 2\\), so its coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{j=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{j} c^{6 - j}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^j = \\sum_{j=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{j} c^{6 - 2j}\n   \\]\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\).\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   Each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from the first part (6) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from the second part (64), resulting in \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " The binomial theorem says that each term in the expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{n}{k}a^{n - k}b^k\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to \\(n\\).\n\nSo, applying that to \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion will have terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\). I'm specifically looking for the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me write that down. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I want the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so that means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!}\\). Let me compute that: 4 factorial is 24, and 2 factorial is 2, so 24 divided by (2 times 2) is 24 divided by 4, which is 6. So the coefficient from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part is 6.\n\nNow, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider this part as well because the entire expression is the product of these two expansions. But wait, I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, does this mean I need to multiply by something from the second part? Or does the second part not affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms?\n\nWait, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So when I multiply the two expansions together, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are only coming from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms are from the second part. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Therefore, the coefficient from the second part is just 1, because I'm not selecting any terms from it\u2014so it's like multiplying by the constant term.\n\nWait, let me think again. Actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, if I have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, it will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means I'm only interested in the terms in the second expansion that have \\(c^0\\), because \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0\\) will be \\(a^2b^2\\), and any other power of \\(c\\) would change the term. So, actually, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by the coefficient from the first part.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, I need to find the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by that term, it will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression.\n\nSo, let me focus on finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nI need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so I set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), I get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0}\\). Calculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), that's \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!}\\). Calculating that: 6! is 720, and 3! is 6, so 720 divided by (6 times 6) is 720 divided by 36, which is 20. So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient from the second part is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients from both parts. That is, 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 times 20 is 120.\n\nWait, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then I found the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20, because that's the only term that won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) part when multiplying. So, when I multiply these two coefficients together, 6 times 20, I get 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any calculation errors. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), gives a coefficient of 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), gives a coefficient of 20 for \\(c^0\\). Multiplying these together, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\). We need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), which occurs when \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). We need the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). Setting the exponent of \\(c\\) to 0, we solve \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) to get \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from both parts:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " The same goes for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to expand the entire thing. Let me think.\n\nSo, the expression is a product of two binomials raised to different powers. The first part is \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient for the term \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, right? The second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are separate variables. So, does that mean that the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\)?\n\nLet me confirm that. If I expand both parts separately, the terms from \\((a + b)^4\\) will only involve powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will involve powers of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So when I multiply them together, each term will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second part, and \\(c\\) doesn't appear in the first part, the variables are all distinct. That means the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but wait, no. Actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since the variables are different, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the term from the first expansion and multiply it by any term from the second expansion, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), maybe the coefficient is just the coefficient from the first part, and the second part's expansion doesn't affect it? Wait, that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since the variables are different, the product terms will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) parts. So, if I'm looking for a term that has only \\(a^2b^2\\), that means I need to consider the term in the first expansion that is \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the term in the second expansion that is \\(1\\), because if I multiply by any term in the second expansion, it would add \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) terms, which I don't want. So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because \\(c^0\\) is 1, so that would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times 1, which is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\).\n\nWait, but that seems a bit confusing. Let me try to structure it better. Let me denote the first part as \\(A = (a + b)^4\\) and the second part as \\(B = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I multiply A and B, each term in A is multiplied by each term in B. So, if I'm looking for a term in the product that has \\(a^2b^2\\), it must come from taking the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from A and multiplying it by a term from B that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Since B only has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the only term in B that doesn't add any new variables is the constant term, which is \\(c^0 = 1\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\(A \\times B\\) is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in A multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in B.\n\nSo, now I need to compute two things: first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), and second, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, I'll multiply those two coefficients together to get the final answer.\n\nStarting with the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{k} b^{4 - k}\\). So, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), because then we have \\(a^2b^{4 - 2} = a^2b^2\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, this expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{6 - m}\\). Simplifying the exponents, we get \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{m - (6 - m)} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{2m - 6}\\).\n\nWe need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, we set \\(2m - 6 = 0\\), which gives \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20.\n\nNow, since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6 and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives a constant term with coefficient 20. So, when I multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire product being a multiplication of two polynomials, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only formed by taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiplying it by the constant term from the second part. So, yes, that would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nLet me just verify the binomial coefficients again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is indeed 6. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent is 0 is when \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right.\n\nI think that's the correct approach. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem to expand each part separately and then consider the relevant terms.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{k} b^{4 - k}\n\\]\nThe term with \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), giving the coefficient:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{6 - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{2m - 6}\n\\]\nWe need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which occurs when \\(2m - 6 = 0\\), giving \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " The same goes for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I might not need to fully expand both parts. Instead, maybe I can focus on the parts that contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) and see how they interact with the other part.\n\nLet me start by considering just the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will have terms like \\(\\binom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4. I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so that's when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me compute that coefficient.\n\nSo, \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. That means in \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\).\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to figure out how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), so when I multiply, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't be affected by the terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not any specific term involving \\(c\\), maybe I just need to consider that the coefficient from the first part is 6, and then when multiplied by the entire second part, which is a sum, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, no, that might not be right because I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing to the coefficient.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of the two expansions. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression multiplies each term in the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part because each term in the second part contributes to the coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. So, perhaps I should calculate the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all the variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me check my reasoning again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and the second part is multiplied as a whole, so the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would then be 6 times the entire expansion, but that doesn't make sense because coefficients are numerical values, not expressions. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, no, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which includes both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms as well as \\(c\\) terms. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're looking for the coefficient, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so each term in the second expansion will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but let me think differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but no, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient would be the same as 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes a term like \\(6 \\times \\text{(coefficient from second part)} \\times a^2b^2c^k\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be the sum of all those coefficients multiplied by 6. Therefore, the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me try a different approach. Let's consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term would come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial and the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) in the second polynomial, because only then will the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, leaving just a constant multiplier for \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and, say, \\(c^k\\) from the second part, then the term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but the problem is just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second part where \\(c^k\\) is such that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it just gives \\(a^2b^2\\) times a coefficient. But actually, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first polynomial, and the second polynomial is a separate expansion, so when you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial would be multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nBut wait, that's the same as before. So, if the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of its coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the product of the coefficients from each part. But that can't be right because the second part isn't just a constant; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second polynomial, which means the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. Let's take a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part, which is \\(\\binom{2}{2}=1\\), and then multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is \\((1 + 1) = 2\\), so the coefficient would be 1*2=2. Let me expand it to check: \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\). Multiplying them gives \\(a^2c + 2abc + b^2c + a^2/c + 2ab/c + b^2/c\\). Now, looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), but wait, there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term here because in this case, the second polynomial is only degree 1, so when multiplied by \\(a^2\\), it's \\(a^2c\\) and \\(a^2/c\\), but not \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, so maybe my earlier approach is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I misunderstood the problem. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\). So, when I multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by each term in the second part. So, each term in the second part is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in my earlier simpler example, when I took \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no \\(b\\) in the second polynomial. Wait, no, in that case, \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present because the first polynomial only goes up to \\(b^2\\), but when multiplied by the second polynomial, which is in \\(c\\), there's no \\(b\\) involved, so \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't actually present. So, perhaps my initial approach is incorrect because in the given problem, the second polynomial doesn't contain \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each power of \\(c\\), making the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it and the correct approach is to recognize that since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's simply the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms in the first polynomial that multiply together to give that specific term. So, in this case, the specific term is \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first polynomial, and any term from the second polynomial, regardless of \\(c\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is 6, and the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but let me check this with another example to make sure. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because the first polynomial only has \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) to the first power. But according to my method, the coefficient from the first part is zero because \\(\\binom{1}{2}\\) is zero, so 0 * 64=0, which is correct.\n\nAnother example: \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is \\(\\binom{2}{2}=1\\). The sum of coefficients in the second part is \\((1 + 1)^2=4\\). So, the coefficient would be 1*4=4. Let's expand it: \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). Multiplying them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from \\(a^2 \\times b^2 \\times 1\\) (from the constant term in the second polynomial). Wait, but in the product, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, \\(a^2\\) from the first is multiplied by \\(c^2\\), 2, and \\(1/c^2\\), giving \\(a^2c^2\\), \\(2a^2\\), and \\(a^2/c^2\\). Similarly, \\(b^2\\) from the first is multiplied by \\(c^2\\), 2, and \\(1/c^2\\), giving \\(b^2c^2\\), \\(2b^2\\), and \\(b^2/c^2\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from the product of \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term 2, right? So, \\(a^2 \\times 2 \\times b^2 = 2a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 2, but according to my earlier method, it would be 1 * 4 = 4, which is incorrect. So, my method is wrong.\n\nWait, so in this example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 2, not 4. That means my approach of multiplying the coefficient from the first part by the sum of coefficients in the second part is incorrect. So, where did I go wrong?\n\nLet me analyze this example again. The first polynomial is \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). The second polynomial is \\((c + 1/c)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). When I multiply them, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by multiplying \\(a^2\\) from the first polynomial with \\(b^2\\), but in reality, the first polynomial doesn't have a \\(b^2\\) term that's separate from \\(a^2\\). Wait, actually, the first polynomial has \\(a^2\\), \\(2ab\\), and \\(b^2\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, you get \\(a^2c^2\\), \\(2a^2\\), and \\(a^2/c^2\\). Similarly, multiplying \\(b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial gives \\(b^2c^2\\), \\(2b^2\\), and \\(b^2/c^2\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from the product of \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\), but since they are separate terms, you can't directly multiply them. Wait, actually, no, because in the product, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), you'd need to multiply \\(a^2\\) from the first with \\(b^2\\) from the first, but that's not how polynomial multiplication works. Each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, \\(a^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^2\\), 2, and \\(1/c^2\\), and \\(b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^2\\), 2, and \\(1/c^2\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't appear in the product because there's no term that combines \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) from the first polynomial with anything from the second. Wait, but that's not correct because in the first polynomial, \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) are separate terms, so when multiplied by the second polynomial, they produce separate terms involving \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\), but not \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, so in this example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually zero because there's no way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. But when I thought earlier, I thought that \\(a^2 \\times 2 \\times b^2\\) would give \\(2a^2b^2\\), but that's not how polynomial multiplication works. Each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second, so \\(a^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second, and \\(b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second, but \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from a term that has both \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) in the first polynomial, which doesn't exist because the first polynomial is \\((a + b)^2\\), which has \\(a^2\\), \\(2ab\\), and \\(b^2\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would require multiplying \\(a^2\\) from the first with \\(b^2\\) from the first, but that's not how it works because each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, not within the first.\n\nTherefore, in the example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because you can't get \\(a^2b^2\\) from the product of the two polynomials. But when I thought earlier, I thought that \\(a^2 \\times 2 \\times b^2\\) would give \\(2a^2b^2\\), but that's incorrect because \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) are separate terms in the first polynomial. So, my initial approach was wrong because I thought that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each part, but that's not the case.\n\nSo, going back to the original problem, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, 6, because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) remains 6, and the \\(c\\) terms just tag along, making the entire term \\(6 \\times \\text{(second polynomial)} \\times a^2b^2\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient, which should be a numerical value, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6*64=384. But in my earlier example, that approach gave me the wrong answer, so I must be missing something.\n\nWait, in my earlier example, the first polynomial was \\((a + b)^2\\) and the second was \\((c + 1/c)^2\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product should be zero because you can't get \\(a^2b^2\\) from the product. But according to my method, it would be 1 * 4 = 4, which is wrong. So, my method is flawed.\n\nWait, so maybe the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first part, 6, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that can't be right because when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384. But in my example, that approach failed because it gave me 4 instead of zero.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that in my example, the first polynomial doesn't have a term that can combine to give \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the original problem, since the first polynomial has \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second polynomial has terms in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nBut in my example, the first polynomial was \\((a + b)^2\\), which has terms \\(a^2\\), \\(2ab\\), and \\(b^2\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present in the first polynomial, so when multiplied by the second polynomial, it remains absent. So, in that case, the coefficient is zero, which is correct. Therefore, in the original problem, since the first polynomial has \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient in the product would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but in my example, the first polynomial didn't have \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient was zero. In the original problem, the first polynomial does have \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^3 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is \\(\\binom{3}{2}=3\\). The sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is \\((1 + 1)^1=2\\). So, according to my method, the coefficient would be 3*2=6. Let's see if that's correct.\n\nExpanding the first polynomial: \\((a + b)^3 = a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3\\). The second polynomial: \\(c + 1/c\\). Multiplying them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from \\(3a^2b \\times 1/c\\) and \\(3ab^2 \\times c\\), but no, actually, no, because \\(a^2b\\) times \\(1/c\\) is \\(a^2b/c\\), and \\(ab^2\\) times \\(c\\) is \\(ab^2c\\), neither of which is \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually zero, which contradicts my method.\n\nWait, so in this case, my method would give 3*2=6, but the actual coefficient is zero. So, my method is incorrect.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. So, my initial approach seems to work in some cases but not others. Maybe the correct approach is to realize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, but only if the first polynomial contains the term \\(a^2b^2\\). However, in the example where the first polynomial is \\((a + b)^3\\), it doesn't have a \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient is zero. But in the original problem, the first polynomial does have a \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 384.\n\nWait, but in the \\((a + b)^3 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\) example, the first polynomial doesn't have a \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient is zero, which matches the actual expansion. So, perhaps in the original problem, since the first polynomial does have a \\(a^2b^2\\) term, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 384.\n\nWait, but in my earlier \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\) example, the first polynomial doesn't have a \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient is zero, which is correct. So, in the original problem, since the first polynomial does have a \\(a^2b^2\\) term, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 384.\n\nWait, but in the \\((a + b)^3 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\) example, the first polynomial doesn't have a \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient is zero, which is correct. So, perhaps the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, but only if the first polynomial contains the term \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, in the original problem, since the first polynomial does contain \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient is 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but let me check this with another example where the first polynomial does have the term. Let's take \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is 6, and the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is 2. So, according to my method, the coefficient would be 6*2=12. Let's expand it: \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The second polynomial is \\(c + 1/c\\). Multiplying them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), giving \\(6a^2b^2c\\) and \\(6a^2b^2/c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6*(1 + 1)=12, which matches my method. So, in this case, it works.\n\nSimilarly, in the original problem, the first polynomial has \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and the second polynomial has sum of coefficients 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6*64=384.\n\nTherefore, after going through these examples and correcting my approach, I can conclude that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4-k} b^k\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which occurs when \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient for this term is:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n   Thus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Considering the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   The sum of the coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n   This sum represents the total of all coefficients in the expansion of the second polynomial.\n\n3. **Combining the results**:\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of the coefficients from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " The binomial theorem states that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLet me start by looking at the first part of the expression, \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this should expand to a sum where each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\), right? So, for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\), the terms would be:\n\n- When \\(k = 0\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} a^4 b^0 = 1 \\cdot a^4 = a^4\\)\n- When \\(k = 1\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} a^3 b^1 = 4 \\cdot a^3 b\\)\n- When \\(k = 2\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2 b^2 = 6 \\cdot a^2 b^2\\)\n- When \\(k = 3\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} a^1 b^3 = 4 \\cdot a b^3\\)\n- When \\(k = 4\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} a^0 b^4 = 1 \\cdot b^4\\)\n\nSo, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. Okay, so that part is straightforward.\n\nNow, the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider the expansion of both parts and then multiply them together. But wait, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, right? Because the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), involves variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when I multiply the two expansions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\).\n\nBut since the question is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that means we need to find all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some combination from the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, the variables in each part are different, so actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but wait, that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, resulting in multiple terms in the product. But the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the products where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term with only \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second expansion has only \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the product terms will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by terms like \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\). But since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are different variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if it's multiplied by a constant term in the second expansion, i.e., a term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because if it's multiplied by \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\) where \\(k \\neq 0\\), the resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\).\n\nWait, that makes sense because the constant term in the second expansion will be the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, let me try to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). I need the term where the exponent is zero, so I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), I get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20 \\cdot 1 = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives terms involving \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, 1, 1/c^2, 1/c^4, 1/c^6\\). When I multiply these two expansions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the only way that happens is when \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) in the second expansion. So, the constant term is 20, as I found earlier, so 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire product expression being the product of two polynomials, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the constant term in the second polynomial. That also makes sense because when you multiply two terms, one from each polynomial, the variables multiply. So, to get a term with only \\(a^2b^2\\), the other part must be a constant, so it doesn't contribute any \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), correct. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs at \\(m = 3\\), so the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), correct. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Yep, that seems right.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: when you have two separate variables, the coefficients multiply when you take the product. So, if I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\) and \\( (c + 1/c)^6 \\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that's not exactly right. Because the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a Laurent polynomial, but when considering the product, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part? Wait, no, that can't be right because the second part has terms with \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by those terms, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which aren't \\(a^2b^2\\) alone. So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is if it's multiplied by the constant term in the second part, which is 20. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120, as before.\n\nWait, but actually, the entire product is a polynomial in \\(a, b, c, 1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would appear only if it's multiplied by a term in the second polynomial that has \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me consider expanding both expressions and see what happens. The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is as I did before, and the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is:\n\n- \\(c^6\\) term: \\(\\dbinom{6}{0} = 1\\)\n- \\(c^4\\) term: \\(\\dbinom{6}{1} = 6\\)\n- \\(c^2\\) term: \\(\\dbinom{6}{2} = 15\\)\n- \\(c^0\\) term: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\)\n- \\(c^{-2}\\) term: \\(\\dbinom{6}{4} = 15\\)\n- \\(c^{-4}\\) term: \\(\\dbinom{6}{5} = 6\\)\n- \\(c^{-6}\\) term: \\(\\dbinom{6}{6} = 1\\)\n\nSo, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by each of these terms, the only time \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear as a standalone term is when it's multiplied by the constant term (20). So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Or do I?\n\nWait, no, actually, the entire expression is a product of two binomials, so when I expand both parts, I'll have terms from each expansion multiplied together. But since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can focus on the part of the expansion that gives me \\(a^2b^2\\) and then see how it interacts with the other part.\n\nLet me start by expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem states that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^k\\). So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), each term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4.\n\nI need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, substituting \\(k = 2\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2} b^{2}\\). Calculating the binomial coefficient, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to expand this as well. Again, using the binomial theorem, each term will be \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\), where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6.\n\nSimplifying each term, \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWait, but since I'm multiplying \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the entire expression is the product of two expansions. So, when I multiply them, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion.\n\nBut since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first expansion, I can consider that term and see how it interacts with the second expansion. However, the second expansion involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables. So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, I'll get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) and \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^m}\\), but since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate, the only way for the term to remain as \\(a^2b^2\\) is if the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because if the exponent is non-zero, the term would have a \\(c\\) part, which isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, in the product, to get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\), the part from the second expansion must be \\(c^0\\), which is 1. Therefore, I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\). \n\nSo, from the second expansion, the term where the exponent is zero is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} \\times 1 = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, when I multiply the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion by 20 from the second expansion, I get \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2 = 120a^2b^2\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 120.

Let me list them:\n\n- When \\(m=0\\), exponent is 6.\n- \\(m=1\\), exponent is 4.\n- \\(m=2\\), exponent is 2.\n- \\(m=3\\), exponent is 0.\n- \\(m=4\\), exponent is -2.\n- \\(m=5\\), exponent is -4.\n- \\(m=6\\), exponent is -6.\n\nSo, there is a term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which is when \\(m=3\\). That term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\\). So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But specifically, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each part. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but without any \\(c\\) terms. So, that would only happen if the \\(c\\) term is \\(c^0\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, from earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by each term in the second part. But since we're looking for the term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, we need the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the 0 power, which is the constant term. So, yes, that would be 20. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the constant term of the second expansion, which is 20, so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). And \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). So, when I multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first will be multiplied by each term in the second. But the only way to get a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is if it's multiplied by the constant term, which is 20. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the product, each term will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have to be multiplied by a term that is \\(c^0\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), that would be different, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), it's only the term where \\(c\\) is raised to 0. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the binomial coefficients. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) because \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) implies \\(m = 3\\). So, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), which is correct.\n\nAnd for \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), which is correct.\n\nSo, multiplying these together, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think if there's another way to approach this. Suppose I consider the entire product as a product of two independent expansions. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the coefficients would multiply when the terms are multiplied. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is exactly what I did.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nThe term with \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each expansion:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

But since the question is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think I can focus on the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and maybe the second part might not affect that term. Wait, let me think.\n\nSo, the entire expression is a product of two binomials raised to powers: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since these are multiplied together, the expansion will involve terms from both expansions multiplied together. But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, right? Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first binomial, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the second. So, when I multiply them, the variables from the first part and the second part will be separate. That means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply it by any term from the second expansion, it will just add another factor, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term with no \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), it must be multiplied by the term in the second expansion that is \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, I need to find two things: first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), and second, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, I multiply those two coefficients together to get the final answer.\n\nLet me start with the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), because \\(4 - k = 2\\) implies \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. Using the binomial theorem again, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, since the two parts are multiplied together, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 and 20. So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120.\n\nWait, let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 because \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 times 20 is 120. That seems correct.\n\nI don't think I missed anything here. The key was recognizing that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so it's only affected by the constant term in the second expansion. If the problem had asked for a term that includes \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), then I would have had to consider cross terms, but in this case, it's straightforward.\n\nSo, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\).

But since the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think I can handle each part separately and then multiply the coefficients together if needed. Wait, but actually, since the two parts are multiplied together, the terms from each expansion will multiply each other. So maybe I should find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and then see how it combines with the second part. Hmm, but wait, the second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so maybe those terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms directly. Let me think.\n\nOkay, so let's start with the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\). So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So that coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand this as well using the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). That means that when I multiply the two expansions together, I need to find terms where the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So I think I need to find the terms in the second expansion where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because \\(c^0 = 1\\), which doesn't affect the term.\n\nSo, in the second part, I need to find the term where \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Let's solve for \\(m\\): \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) \u21d2 \\(2m = 6\\) \u21d2 \\(m = 3\\). So the coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nWait, but hold on a second. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of the two expansions. So actually, when I multiply the two expansions, each term from the first part will multiply each term from the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to make sure that the term from the second expansion doesn't have any \\(c\\) in it. So, as I found earlier, the term with \\(c^0\\) is the one where \\(m = 3\\), and its coefficient is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from the first expansion) multiplied by 20 (from the second expansion). So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Because in the first part, we have \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and in the second part, we have a term with coefficient 20 that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So when we multiply them together, the term becomes \\(6 \\times 20 \\times a^2b^2 \\times 1\\), which is \\(120a^2b^2\\). So the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nHmm, but wait another thought: When we multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, in this case, the first polynomial has terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), etc., and the second polynomial has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So when we multiply, for example, \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part by \\(20\\) from the second part, we get \\(120a^2b^2\\). But also, if there are other terms in the second expansion that, when multiplied by some terms from the first expansion, might give \\(a^2b^2\\), but since the second expansion's terms involve \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), unless they multiply by a term that cancels out the \\(c\\), it won't contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, only the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) in the second expansion will contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion. So, I think my initial conclusion is correct.\n\nWait, but wait again. Let me think more carefully. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The entire expression is a product of two independent expansions. So, when you multiply them, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, to get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to multiply a term from the first expansion that's \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term from the second expansion that's \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. Because if we multiply by any other term from the second expansion, say \\(c^1\\) or \\(c^{-1}\\), the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), which are not \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the constant term from the second expansion will contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is indeed the product of the coefficients: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times 20 (from the constant term) equals 120. So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. That's correct. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is when \\(m = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. That's also correct. So 6 * 20 is indeed 120.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me write out the expansions more explicitly.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\):\n- \\(a^4\\)\n- \\(4a^3b\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2\\)\n- \\(4ab^3\\)\n- \\(b^4\\)\n\nSecond, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\):\n- \\(c^6\\)\n- \\(6c^4\\)\n- \\(15c^2\\)\n- \\(20\\) (which is \\(c^0\\))\n- \\(15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(c^{-6}\\)\n\nNow, when we multiply these two polynomials together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, for example, \\(a^4 \\times c^6 = a^4c^6\\), \\(a^4 \\times 6c^4 = 6a^4c^4\\), and so on. But the only way to get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by \\(20\\), which gives \\(120a^2b^2\\). All other terms from the second expansion would introduce a power of \\(c\\), which we don't want. So, yeah, 120 is the correct coefficient.\n\nI think I'm confident now that 120 is the right answer. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break it down into two parts and use the binomial theorem for each.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   The general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\). For \\(a^2b^2\\), we set \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), giving the coefficient as \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). To find the term independent of \\(c\\), set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), giving \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients:**\n   Multiply the coefficients from each expansion: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, does that mean we need to sum all the coefficients from \\(Q(c)\\) and multiply by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\)?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion, but since the second expansion doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, that might make sense. Let me verify. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. Then, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.\n\nWait, maybe not. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by each term in the other polynomial, but in this case, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But I'm not entirely confident.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is just extra. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes the second part. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me check. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when expanded, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it gets multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part contributes a coefficient, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), it's like adding up all those contributions.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, the answer should be 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let's think about how the expansion works. Each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\), and each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when you multiply these together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(k = 2\\) in the first expansion, which gives \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). Then, this term is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times each \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\) term is \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\) is the sum from \\(m=0\\) to \\(6\\) of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), which is \\(6 \\times 2^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So yes, that confirms it.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would have needed to consider only the terms where \\(6 - 2m = k\\), but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), we sum over all \\(m\\), which gives us 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient in the first part times the entire second part evaluated at \\(c = 1\\), because that gives the sum of all coefficients. So, that also leads to 6 times 64, which is 384. So, I think that's correct.\n\nSo, to summarize, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64, so the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(64\\). Multiplying these together gives the total coefficient as \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " Similarly, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can also be expanded using the binomial theorem. But wait, the problem is asking specifically about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I don't need to expand the entire expression, just focus on the parts that contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nLet me break it down. The entire expression is the product of two binomials raised to powers: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since these are multiplied together, the terms from each expansion will multiply each other. But I'm only interested in the terms where the product results in \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then consider how it interacts with the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but actually, since the two parts are multiplied together, any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will be multiplied by a term from \\((a + b)^4\\). However, since \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\) are separate variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) won't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nHold on, perhaps I need to consider that when I multiply the two expansions, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will multiply each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will only come from the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that doesn't seem right either because the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), so maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But no, because when you multiply, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a specific term, not a product of terms.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all separate variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will only come from the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, that seems like it would make the coefficient much larger, but maybe that's correct.\n\nWait, let's test this with smaller exponents to see if this approach makes sense. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 (from \\((a + b)^1\\)) multiplied by the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\), which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be 2. But wait, actually, when you expand \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), you get \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). So the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is not a constant but a term involving \\(c\\). Hmm, that's different. So maybe my initial approach is wrong.\n\nWait, so in that small example, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is not a constant but a term involving \\(c\\). So perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would also be a term involving \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient, which might be a numerical coefficient if we treat \\(c\\) as a variable, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), so it's the sum of all coefficients from the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part multiplied by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\).\n\nWait, but in the small example, when I expand \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a term, not a number. So if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), then perhaps the coefficient is zero because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), and all the terms from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) involve \\(c\\) to some power. Wait, but that can't be right because when you multiply, the terms can combine. For example, if you have \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{-k}\\), but that would still leave \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0 = 1\\), so that term would be \\(a^2b^2\\). So perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nAh, that makes sense. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term involving \\(c^k\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but if \\(k=0\\), then it's just \\(a^2b^2\\). So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That seems correct.\n\nSo, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n\\]\n\nWe need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so we set \\(4 - k = 2\\) which gives \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNext, we need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so:\n\n\\[\n6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nNow, multiply the two coefficients together: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) at \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiplying them gives 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, to ensure I didn't make a mistake, let me consider the general term in the product. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from selecting 2 a's and 2 b's from the first binomial, and any term from the second binomial that doesn't affect the a and b terms. But since the second binomial only involves c, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any c terms is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term (c^0) from the second expansion. So yes, that makes sense.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, applying the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will have terms like \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\). The term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs is when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), right? So that would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2} b^{2}\\). Let me compute that coefficient: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so that means I have to consider the product of the two expansions. But wait, the first part is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So when I multiply them together, the variables involved are different, right? So the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are separate from the \\(c\\) terms.

Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So when you multiply them out, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since the variables are different, the only way to get an \\(a^2b^2\\) term is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by some term from the second part. But the second part has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term like \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), you still have \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), but that's a different term. So in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, because any term from the second part would introduce \\(c\\) terms, which aren't present in \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check if I'm missing something. So, the first part gives me 6 as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\), and when I multiply by any term from the second part, it's going to multiply by some coefficient times \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. But wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the product is a separate term. So actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, but that's not right because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by each term in the first expansion.\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, regardless of the second part. Because when you multiply, the variables are separate, so \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the first part, and it's multiplied by the entire second expansion. But wait, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion. But that can't be because the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\), so it's not contributing to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, because the second expansion doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms.\n\nWait, but that seems too simple. Let me think again. Let's consider the product:\n\n\\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\left(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\right) \\times \\left(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m}\\right)\\).\n\nWait, actually, the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which can be written as \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo when I multiply the two expansions together, each term from the first sum is multiplied by each term from the second sum. So the general term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\), which gives the coefficient from the first part as \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, since the second part is multiplied by this term, the entire coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, that would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) evaluated at \\(c = 1\\), which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that seems too high.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all terms in the other polynomial. So if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's actually the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the variables are different.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials. The first polynomial has variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the second has variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So when you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial.\n\nBut when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiply it by the constant term (the term where \\(c^0\\)) from the second polynomial. Because any other term in the second polynomial would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, which would make the term in the product have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or similar, but not just \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nAh, that makes sense. So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part.\n\nSo, let's compute that. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, as I found earlier. Now, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let's find that.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Now, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it's the product of the coefficients from each part. So that's 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the first part gives me 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives me 20 for \\(c^0\\). So when I multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought that maybe I needed to consider the entire second expansion, but now I see that only the constant term affects the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, that makes sense because any other term in the second expansion would introduce a \\(c\\) term, which isn't present in \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations. The binomial coefficient for the first part, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), is indeed 6. For the second part, the coefficient where \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. So 6 * 20 is 120. Yep, that seems right.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2} b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) or \\(m = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Similarly, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can also be expanded using the binomial theorem. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think I should focus on the part with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) first because that's where the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes from. The part with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) might affect the overall coefficient, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe I can handle those parts separately. Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is the product of both binomials, so I might need to consider how the coefficients from each part combine. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, let's handle \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, which states that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^k\\), I can expand this. So for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion will be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means I need the term where the power of \\(a\\) is 2 and the power of \\(b\\) is 2. So in the binomial expansion, that corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), because \\(4 - k = 2\\) when \\(k = 2\\). So the coefficient here is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So the coefficient from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part is 6.\n\nNow, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Similarly, I can expand this using the binomial theorem: \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, since the original problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think I need to find the term in this expansion where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because \\(c^0 = 1\\), which is a constant term, and that won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term when we multiply the two expansions together. So I need to find the value of \\(m\\) such that \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Let me solve for \\(m\\): \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) \u2192 \\(2m = 6\\) \u2192 \\(m = 3\\). So the term where \\(m = 3\\) will give me \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. The coefficient here is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6*6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So the coefficient from the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part is 20.\n\nNow, since the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, but we also have to consider the constant term from the second part because when we multiply, the terms will combine. So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in the second expansion). So 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), gives me \\(a^2b^2\\) with a coefficient of 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), gives me a constant term (c^0) with a coefficient of 20. When I multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, giving \\(20a^2b^2\\). So the coefficient is indeed 20 * 6 = 120. Hmm, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about the entire expansion as a product and see if there's another way to approach it, but I think this method is correct. Another way could be to consider that the entire expression is the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficients multiply when the variables don't interfere. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), and the constant term in the second expansion is just a number, their product will give the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So yeah, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the binomial coefficients to make sure I didn't compute them wrong. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6, that's correct. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(c^{6 - 2m} = c^0\\) is when \\(m = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20, that's correct too. So 6 * 20 is indeed 120.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by expanding each part separately using the binomial theorem, then multiplying the relevant coefficients.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   - The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\) in the binomial expansion.\n   - Coefficient: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   - The constant term (c^0) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) \u2192 \\(m = 3\\).\n   - Coefficient: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   - \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."
