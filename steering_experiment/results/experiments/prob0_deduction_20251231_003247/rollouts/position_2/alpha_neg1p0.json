    "text": " Similarly, the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can also be expanded using the binomial theorem. But wait, the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so maybe the other part with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) doesn't affect it? Or does it? Hmm, maybe not, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). So perhaps I can just focus on the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) there, and then the other part doesn't matter? Let me think about that.\n\nWait, no, because the entire expression is the product of two expansions. So maybe I need to consider both parts together. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the other, when I multiply them out, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I can treat the two parts separately. That is, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient in the product, so perhaps I need to consider the entire expansion. But actually, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, it will still be \\(a^2b^2\\) times something, but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe I need to sum all the possible coefficients from the second expansion. Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will only come from the product of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if I take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by, say, \\(c^k\\) from the second part, then the resulting term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So the only way to get a term that is exactly \\(a^2b^2\\) is if the second part contributes a term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense because then the product would give me a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by 1 (since \\(c^0 = 1\\)), so the coefficient would just be the product of the two coefficients. So, I should calculate both coefficients separately and then multiply them.\n\nFirst, let me find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^4 \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs is when \\(4 - k = 2\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\binom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\binom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I multiply the two coefficients I found: 6 (from the first part) and 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes here. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) indeed has a coefficient of 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when m=3, and \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\) is indeed 20. So, multiplying them together gives 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the entire expression is a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficients multiply when you take terms from each. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. So, the final answer should be 120. I think that's right.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^4 \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{6}{3} = \\frac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both parts:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " So, maybe I can start by expanding each part separately and then see how they combine.\n\nFirst, let's look at \\((a + b)^4\\). I remember the binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, for \\(n = 4\\), this becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, right? Because the problem is asking for \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let me find that term.\n\nIn the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the general term is \\(\\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). So, when \\(k = 2\\), we get the term where \\(a\\) is raised to the power of \\(2\\) and \\(b\\) is also raised to the power of \\(2\\). So, plugging in \\(k = 2\\), the term is \\(\\binom{4}{2} a^{2} b^{2}\\). Calculating the binomial coefficient, \\(\\binom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the expansion of this as well, but I'm not sure if I need all the terms or just specific ones. Wait, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to consider the other variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), so their coefficients won't be affected by the terms involving \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I can just consider the coefficient from the first part and that's it? Wait, no, because the entire expression is the product of two expansions, so maybe the coefficients multiply? Let me think.\n\nWait, no, actually, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) will be multiplied by the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second part is multiplied by the first part, so each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), then the terms from the second expansion that are constants (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. Because when you multiply the two expansions, the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out (i.e., \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms) will contribute to the constant term, which then gets multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.\n\nSo, to clarify, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense because when you multiply the two expansions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, but only the constant term (where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out) will result in a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), which is what we're interested in. So, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nLet me work on that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be done using the binomial theorem as well. The general term is \\(\\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the term where \\(k = 3\\) is \\(\\binom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\binom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, correct. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20, correct. So when we multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But only the term with \\(c^0\\) will give a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there another way to approach this? Maybe by considering the entire expansion and looking for terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, but I think the method I used is correct. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in each part, but since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the second part is zero unless we're considering the constant term, which is 20. Wait, no, that's not quite accurate because the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, but only the constant term in the second part contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. So, yes, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   - Using the binomial theorem, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\binom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\).\n   - Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   - We need the constant term (exponent of \\(c^0\\)).\n   - The general term is \\(\\binom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). Setting \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) gives \\(k = 3\\).\n   - Coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients**:\n   - The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm not sure if I need to expand this part as well, but since the problem is only asking about \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6 times whatever the expansion of the second part is, but wait, no, because when you multiply the two expansions together, each term from the first expansion gets multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't affect the terms involving \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part isn't a scalar; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). Wait, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) part at all because it's separate. Let me think.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right. Because when you multiply the two expressions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me verify. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), when I expand the entire expression, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product of both expansions. So, when I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), etc. Similarly, expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives terms involving different powers of \\(c\\). So, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first will multiply each term from the second. But the problem is only interested in the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing to the overall coefficient.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, as I thought earlier, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about it differently. Let me try to compute the product without considering the \\(c\\) terms. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is independent of the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion (which is 6) multiplied by the entire second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient, not the variable part, perhaps we need to consider that each term in the product will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some term in \\(c\\). But the problem doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. \n\nWait, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought earlier. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I should consider that the two expansions are multiplied together, and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any term in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is indeed 64. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the first polynomial is multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial to get the coefficient of that term in the product.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me think about another approach. Suppose I consider the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I'm only interested in the terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\), then I can take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion, which is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and multiply it by every term in the second expansion. So, each term in the second expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, I get \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, the total coefficient would be the sum over all \\(k\\) of \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). Which is 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\), which is 6 * 2^6 = 6 * 64 = 384. So, that confirms it.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^m\\) for some specific \\(m\\), then I would have to compute a specific term, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient is 384.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Multiplying them gives 384. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\).

That term is part of the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), right? So maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think about that. \n\nWhen you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will come from the first part, and the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) will come from the second part. \n\nBut since the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I might not need to consider the \\(c\\) terms at all, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is the product of both expansions, so maybe the \\(c\\) terms will contribute a constant factor, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term from the first expansion gets multiplied by each term from the second. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to break it down. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from expanding \\((a + b)^4\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in that expansion is given by the binomial coefficient. So, using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). \n\nSo, the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2 would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, since the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when we multiply these out, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem just wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we might need to consider that the coefficient is actually 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. \n\nAh, that makes sense. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, first, we already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, this becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, let me just double-check that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the other expansion is 20, so when you multiply them together, you get 120. That seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, if I think about the entire expression, when you multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only consider the part where the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, i.e., the constant term in the second expansion. \n\nSo, yes, 6 multiplied by 20 is indeed 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by multiplying the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) (which is 6) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) (which is 20). Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

So maybe I don't need to worry about the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Let me think.\n\nFirst, let me focus on expanding \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, which states that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^{k}\\), I can expand this. So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), each term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4.\n\nI need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I should find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That means I need \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), which implies \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nWait, but the original expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that mean I need to consider the entire product? But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, maybe the coefficient remains the same? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again.\n\nNo, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that result in a constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), because multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by a constant will still result in a term with \\(a^2b^2\\). If we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term with \\(c^k\\), that would result in a term with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't what we're looking for. So, we need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me make sure. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the first factor, and when we multiply it by the entire second factor, each term in the second factor will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, we have to consider all the ways \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by terms in the second factor that result in \\(a^2b^2\\). But since the second factor only has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are separate variables, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) remains as \\(a^2b^2\\) is if it's multiplied by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second factor. So, yes, I think I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part.\n\nSo, let's compute the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term: \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\): \\(6 = 2m\\) => \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first part (6) and the constant term from the second part (20). So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The first part gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives 20 for the constant term. So when we multiply these two, we get 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of the two expansions. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and to get the coefficient in the entire product, we multiply it by each term in the second expansion. But only the constant term in the second expansion will contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product, because any other term would introduce \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would make the term have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) instead of just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts.\n\nFirst, we focus on expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. Using the binomial theorem, this term is given by:\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{2} a^2 b^2\n\\]\nCalculating the binomial coefficient:\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). We need the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) because multiplying by this term will not introduce any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factors, thus keeping the term \\(a^2b^2\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term in the expansion is:\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we solve:\n\\[\n6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n\\]\nThe constant term is:\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{3} = \\frac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nFinally, we multiply the coefficient from the first part by the constant term from the second part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

I know that the binomial expansion of \\((a + b)^n\\) is the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(n\\) of \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\).

So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to figure out if I need to consider any terms from this expansion when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so when I multiply them, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. Wait, but in this case, the first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are entirely separate variables. So, when I multiply them, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't affect the terms involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that can't be right because the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a constant, but actually, no, each term in the expansion is a term with a power of \\(c\\). So, when I multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which seems too large. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), it's only present in \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it will result in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Wait, no, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, so actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that can't be right because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But that's not correct because each term in the second part is a separate term with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) be 6 * 64 = 384? Hmm, that seems plausible, but let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the question is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all variables. But that doesn't make much sense because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). So, maybe the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, for example, if I have (P(a,b) * Q(c)), then the coefficient of a^2b^2 in P(a,b) is 6, and when multiplied by Q(c), the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the product would be 6 * Q(c). But that's not a single number; it's a polynomial in c. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all terms, but I think that's not possible because the variables are separate. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, so the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That would make more sense because then we're looking for a specific term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, meaning the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out. That would make more sense.\n\nLet me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power, meaning it's just a constant term. That would make sense because then we're looking for a specific term in the entire expansion.\n\nSo, to clarify, I think the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't typically what such problems ask for.\n\nSo, let me proceed under that assumption. Therefore, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power.\n\nTo do this, I can first find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already determined is 6. Then, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Once I have both coefficients, I can multiply them together to get the final coefficient for the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\).\n\nSo, let's first confirm the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). As I did earlier, using the binomial theorem:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n\\]\n\nWe need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so \\(4 - k = 2\\) implies \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Got that.\n\nNow, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\):\n\n\\[\n6 - 2m = 0 \\implies 2m = 6 \\implies m = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the constant term. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 * 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\n\\]\n\nWait, let me check that calculation again. 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720 divided by (6 * 6) is 720 / 36, which is indeed 20. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, since the two parts are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found. So, that's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. When I multiply the two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\) (which is just 20) from the second part. Therefore, the combined coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me consider another approach. Suppose I consider the entire expansion as the product of two separate expansions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I multiply these two terms together, I get \\(a^2b^2 * c^0 = a^2b^2\\), which is the term we're interested in. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to expand both parts and multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the first part with coefficient 6, and it would be multiplied by every term in the second part. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to consider the part of the second expansion that doesn't involve \\(c\\), which is just the constant term.

    "text": " Similarly, the term \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can also be expanded using the binomial theorem. But wait, the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That makes me think that maybe I don't need to expand the entire expression, just focus on the parts that contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nLet me break it down. The expression is a product of two binomials raised to powers: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since these are multiplied together, the terms from each expansion will multiply term by term. But I'm only interested in the terms where the product results in \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), right? So, the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) at all. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but wait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that's not quite right either because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the terms that multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, any term from the second part will just multiply the entire first part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that correct?\n\nLet me think again. Let's denote the first part as \\(P = (a + b)^4\\) and the second part as \\(Q = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply them together, the product is \\(P \\times Q\\). Now, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) is a term in \\(P\\), and when multiplied by any term in \\(Q\\), it will produce terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{something}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Wait, that's impossible because \\(Q\\) involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so any term in the product will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms and \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\), but since \\(Q\\) is a separate variable, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(Q\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\). So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but let me confirm that. If I have \\(P \\times Q\\), and I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), then that would mean that I need to find all the terms in \\(P \\times Q\\) where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) in it, which we don't want. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(Q\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term (the term where \\(c^0\\)) in \\(Q\\), that's the only way to get a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\) times a constant. So, I think I was wrong earlier; the coefficient isn't the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\), but rather the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(Q\\).\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\), then the term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\) alone, I need to multiply it by the term in \\(Q\\) that has \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, first, let me find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs is when \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6.\n\nNext, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is the sum from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying, this becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20.\n\nNow, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, we multiply the two coefficients we just found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 times 20 is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Is the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) indeed 20? Let me expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) to make sure. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), \\(m = 3\\), and the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20 \\times 1 = 20\\). That's correct.\n\nAnd the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is indeed 6 because \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). So, multiplying them gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other term in the product that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by the constant term from the second part. There's no other way because any other term in the second part would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would make the term have those variables as well. So, yes, 120 is the correct coefficient.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of the entire product as a product of two polynomials and consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be formed by taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and the constant term from the second. Since the second polynomial's constant term is 20, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break it down into two parts:\n\n1. **Finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4-k} b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6-2m}\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficients found above:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So maybe I don't need to worry about the second part when looking for \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, let me think.\n\nWait, no, actually, the entire expression is the product of two binomial expansions. So when I multiply them together, each term from the first expansion will multiply each term from the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, maybe the second part just contributes a constant factor? Or does it? Let me make sure.\n\nLet me break it down. First, I'll handle the \\((a + b)^4\\) part. Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). Now, I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2 b^2\\). Calculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), that's 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that as well. Using the binomial theorem again, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the expansion is the sum from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWait, but when I multiply the two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. However, since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), I need to find the part of the second expansion that is a constant term (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero). Because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a constant, it remains \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant. But if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term involving \\(c\\), it would become \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something, which isn't the term we're looking for. So, I only need the constant term from the second expansion.\n\nSo, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\), as I wrote before. The exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). To find the constant term, I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(2m = 6\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20. So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first expansion (which is 6) and the constant term from the second expansion (which is 20). So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. The first part gives me 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives me 20 as the constant term. So, when I multiply these two parts together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term gets multiplied by 20, making the coefficient 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of the entire expression as the product of two polynomials. The first polynomial contributes \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and the second polynomial contributes 20 as a constant. So, when you multiply them, the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but is there another way to approach this? Maybe by considering the entire expansion and looking for cross terms? Let me see. If I were to expand both expressions and multiply them term by term, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiplying it by the constant term from the second part. Any other combination would introduce \\(c\\) terms, which we don't want. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nI think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   The general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\).

    "text": " So, maybe I can start by expanding each part separately and then see how they combine.\n\nFirst, let's look at \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, which says that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^{k}\\), I can expand this. Here, \\(x = a\\), \\(y = b\\), and \\(n = 4\\). So, each term in the expansion will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\).\n\nI'm specifically looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so that's \\(a^2b^2\\). That would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) because \\(4 - k = 2\\) implies \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, that part is clear; the coefficient is 6.\n\nNow, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to expand this as well. Again, using the binomial theorem, each term will be \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) because \\(\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = c^{-m}\\), so when you multiply \\(c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m}\\), you add the exponents: \\(6 - m - m = 6 - 2m\\).\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). That makes me think that the term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by the term that's a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) in the second part. Because if the second part has a term with \\(c\\) raised to some power, then when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would become \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't what we're looking for. So, to get just \\(a^2b^2\\), we need the constant term from the second expansion.\n\nSo, I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That is, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Let me solve for \\(m\\): \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) implies \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) will be the constant term.\n\nCalculating the coefficient for that term: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient is 20, and the term is \\(20c^{0} = 20\\).\n\nNow, putting it all together: the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). We've found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the constant term in the second part is 20. So, when we multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, giving a coefficient of \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when we multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider how many times \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term. Actually, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second, but since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), the only way that happens is if the term from the second polynomial is a constant, because otherwise, the \\(c\\) terms would introduce \\(c\\) into the product, making it \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the only contribution to \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term 20. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait another thing, maybe I should think about it differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{2}b^{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider all terms where the exponent of \\(a\\) is 2 and \\(b\\) is 2, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, that's not correct because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that the term should have \\(a^2b^2\\) and no \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion by the constant term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. Suppose I consider the entire expansion: \\((a + b)^4\\) gives me terms up to \\(a^4\\) and \\(b^4\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives me terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\). When I multiply these together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part can be multiplied by any term from the second part, but only the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) will result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). Any other term would have \\(c^k\\) attached, which isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, only the constant term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, putting it all together: the coefficient is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which equals 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me think about the entire expansion. The first part is \\((a + b)^4\\), which has terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\).\n\nWhen I multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first will be multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first will be multiplied by each term in the second. The only one that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is when it's multiplied by 20, the constant term. So, that gives \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2 = 120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.

    "text": " So maybe I can start by expanding each part separately and then see how they combine.\n\nFirst, let me consider \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this expansion would be the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). So the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so I need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me check: if \\(k = 2\\), then \\(4 - 2 = 2\\), so yes, that's the term. The coefficient here is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, the expansion is the sum from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nWait a minute, but I'm trying to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The second part of the expression involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply the two parts together, I'm looking for terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out, so that the resulting term doesn't have any \\(c\\) in it. Because if I have a term with \\(c\\) and another term with \\(1/c\\), their product could potentially have \\(c^0\\), which is 1, so that term would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the overall expression.\n\nWait, but actually, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider whether the second part contributes a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), or whether it's multiplied by a term that doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts.\n\nWait, actually, no. Because when you multiply the two expansions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, I need to consider all the terms where the product results in \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a term that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), but only \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that's not quite right because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient and a power of \\(c\\). But since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), I need to find the term in the second expansion that is a constant term, i.e., where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because only then, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nSo, in the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. As I derived earlier, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So setting the exponent equal to zero: \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the constant term. The coefficient here is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of the constant term in the second part is 20. Therefore, when we multiply these two expansions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So when we multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, resulting in \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I don't need to consider any other terms from the second expansion because they would involve powers of \\(c\\), which aren't present in \\(a^2b^2\\). So only the constant term from the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we start by expanding each part separately.\n\nFirst, consider \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. This occurs when \\(k = 2\\), giving the term:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2 b^2 = 6 a^2 b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\nNext, consider \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero). Setting the exponent equal to zero:\n\\[\n6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n\\]\nThe term when \\(m = 3\\) is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of the constant term in this part is 20.\n\nMultiplying the coefficients from both parts, we get:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So for \\(n = 4\\), the expansion would be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\n\\]\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} = 1\\), so the first term is \\(a^4\\).\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} = 4\\), so the second term is \\(4a^3b\\).\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), so the third term is \\(6a^2b^2\\).\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} = 4\\), so the fourth term is \\(4ab^3\\).\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} = 1\\), so the last term is \\(b^4\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Got that part.\n\nNow, the expression also has \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand this part as well. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).

Now, since the original problem is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when we multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first expansion will multiply each term in the second expansion.\n\nBut wait, I only care about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to find all the terms in the product where the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts are \\(a^2b^2\\), and the \\(c\\) parts can be anything because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. However, since the problem just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms? Wait, no, that's not right. Because when we multiply the two expressions, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion will be multiplied by all the terms in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Wait, actually, no, because in the product, each term is a combination of an \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) term and a \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) term. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) term, I might need to sum over all the possible \\(c\\) terms. But the problem is, the problem statement is a bit ambiguous. Let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that's not possible because the coefficient is a scalar, but here, it's multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. Because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense. So, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, that would be the constant term in terms of \\(c\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product.\n\nAlright, that makes more sense. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\). So, let's approach it that way.\n\nSo, from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Now, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 because when we multiply, we want the exponents of \\(c\\) to cancel out, so that the overall exponent is 0. So, let's find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0.\n\nFrom earlier, we have each term as \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so solving for \\(m\\):\n\n\\(6 - 2m = 0\\)\n\n\\(2m = 6\\)\n\n\\(m = 3\\)\n\nSo, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20 \\times 1 = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, since we're multiplying the two expansions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is the product of the coefficients from each expansion. So, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient is 6, and from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient is 20. So, multiplying them together:\n\n\\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\)\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6, and in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when we multiply the two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 will contribute to the \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) term. So, that's why we take the coefficient 6 from the first expansion and multiply it by 20 from the second expansion, giving 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem and find the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   Setting the exponent equal to 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both expansions:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Now, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would correspond to the case where \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me check that: if \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6.

So, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion.\n\nBut the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means we don't care about the \\(c\\) terms at all, right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, regardless of what happens with the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient from the constant term (if any) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't have a constant term, does it?\n\nLet me check that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that's \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The original expression is the product of two binomial expansions. When we multiply them, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. However, only the constant term in the second part (which is 20) will result in a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). All other terms will have some power of \\(c\\), so they won't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because that term doesn't involve \\(c\\). Therefore, only the 20 from the constant term contributes, so the coefficient is indeed \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being a product, so the coefficient is the product of the coefficients from each part that contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) and the constant term. So, yes, that seems right.\n\nWait another thought: is there any possibility that when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) with other terms from the second expansion, I might get another term that's \\(a^2b^2\\) times something else? But no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that only has \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so when multiplied by any term from the second expansion, which has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). But since the question is only about \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms, the only way that can happen is if the second part contributes a constant term, which is 20. So, yes, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I should write out the expansions more explicitly. Let me try that.\n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\):\n\n- The expansion is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6.\n\nNext, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\n- The expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15\\dfrac{1}{c^2} + 6\\dfrac{1}{c^4} + \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\). So, the constant term is 20, as I found earlier.\n\nNow, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, when I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I only care about the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term (which is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2) and the constant term from the second expansion (which is 20). So, multiplying them gives 6 * 20 = 120, so the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's any other term in the second expansion that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by a term from the first expansion. For example, if I have a term like \\(c^2\\) from the second expansion, then when multiplied by a term from the first expansion, say \\(a^2b^2\\), it would give \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\), so it doesn't contribute. Similarly, any term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) won't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). Therefore, only the constant term in the second expansion contributes, so 20 is the only term that matters, leading to 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait another thought: perhaps I should consider whether the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire expansion, but maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, that would be 6 * 20 = 120, as I thought before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum over all possible products where the exponents add up correctly. But in this case, since the second polynomial only contributes a constant term when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient is just 6 * 20.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use generating functions or multinomial coefficients, but I think the approach I've taken is correct. Let me just confirm by another method.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and since I'm only interested in terms that don't involve \\(c\\), I can set \\(c = 1\\) because any term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) would become 1, but wait, no, that's not correct because setting \\(c = 1\\) would make all terms in the second expansion equal to 1, so the entire second expansion would be \\(2^6 = 64\\). But wait, that might not help because I'm specifically looking for the constant term. Alternatively, maybe I can evaluate the coefficient by substituting \\(c = 1\\) and then seeing the value, but that might not give me just the constant term. Hmm, perhaps that's overcomplicating.\n\nWait, another approach: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first factor and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second factor, since any other term in the second factor would introduce a \\(c\\) term, which we don't want. So, that would be 6 * 20 = 120, as before.\n\nI think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120. So, the final answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\):\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\n\\]\n\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nWe need the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Solving \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) gives \\(m = 3\\). The constant term is:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Similarly, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which I can also expand using the binomial theorem. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is part of the first expansion. So, maybe I don't need to worry about the second part when finding the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think.\n\nFirst, let's focus on expanding \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, each term in the expansion is given by \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4. So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). Now, I'm interested in the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would mean \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nLet me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, maybe not directly because the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are in the first part, and the \\(c\\) terms are in the second part. So, when we multiply the two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient remains the same as in the first part. Wait, that doesn't sound right. Because when you multiply, the coefficient might get multiplied by something from the second expansion.\n\nWait, no, actually, no. Let me clarify. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first expansion, right? So, when we multiply by the second expansion, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so when we multiply it by terms from the second expansion, it will result in terms that have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot 1/c^k\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only come from the case where we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by 1 in the second expansion. Wait, is that possible?\n\nWait, no. Because the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded will have terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), \\(1/c^6\\). So, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) (which is a term from the first expansion) by each term in the second expansion, the only way to get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) is if we multiply it by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the constant term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term in the second part), which is 120.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the first part gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and the second part has a constant term 20. So, when we multiply these together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. But wait, is that correct? Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, and the coefficients add up if the variables match. But in this case, since the first part is \\(a^2b^2\\) and the second part is a constant, the product will indeed have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6*20=120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm considering all possibilities. Could there be any other terms in the second expansion that, when multiplied by terms from the first expansion, result in \\(a^2b^2\\)? For example, if the second expansion had a term with \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term, but also, if the first expansion had a term that when multiplied by \\(c^k\\) would result in \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, no, because \\(c^k\\) can't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion by the constant term from the second expansion. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the entire expression is the product of two expansions, and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so it's possible that it's considering the term without any \\(c\\) terms, meaning the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, but that's not the case here because \\(a^2b^2\\) is separate from the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, no, actually, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would include all possible terms with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But wait, that's not right because the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so when you expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{-m}\\), etc. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only be the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, i.e., the constant term. So, that means the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this. If the problem had been asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 120. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which might imply that it's considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that can't be, because in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, leading to terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by 6. But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps I was correct the first time that it's 120, because that's the coefficient when \\(c^0\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that it's considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) exponents. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * (sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)). But the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that each term in the first expansion, specifically \\(a^2b^2\\), is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But the sum of coefficients in the second part is when \\(c = 1\\), so that's \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. But that contradicts my earlier thought where I considered only the constant term. Hmm, now I'm confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible exponents of \\(c\\). But that would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times each term in the second expansion, but that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) as 6 * coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply that it's considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) exponents. But that doesn't make sense because in the product, each term is a combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) exponents. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. That would make the coefficient 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, each multiplied by the corresponding \\(c\\) term. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would require considering all possible \\(c\\) exponents, but that seems unlikely because the problem is phrased as a single coefficient. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, but that's not a standard way to phrase it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and not considering the second part at all. But that can't be right because the problem includes both parts.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanded, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^{-m}\\), etc. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the product as \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^m\\) for various \\(m\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all such terms. But that's not possible because each term would have different exponents of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems too large. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the product would be the sum of all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion, but that's not how coefficients work. Each term in the product is a combination, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 * coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply that it's considering all possible \\(k\\), which isn't standard. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, that doesn't seem right because in the product, each term is a combination, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384, which is a very large number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and not considering the second part. But that can't be because the problem includes both parts.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But in the product, each term is a combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) terms. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only appear once, multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the only term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is the constant term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that it's considering all possible \\(c\\) exponents, but that's not standard. Therefore, I think the correct answer is 120.\n\nLet me recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\).\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^3 \\cdot (1/c)^3 = 20c^0 = 20\\).\n\n3. When multiplying the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. The only term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is the constant term 20.\n\n4. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   The constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^3 \\cdot \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^3 = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the relevant terms:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nHmm, let me think. Since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, and the other part involves \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), which don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), does that mean that when I multiply, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?

But since the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think that the coefficient will be the product of the coefficients from each part, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first part, the coefficient from the second part will just be the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that might not be correct.\n\nLet me clarify. When you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part contributes a factor that gets multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), and since we're only interested in the coefficient, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we can sum all the coefficients from the second part.\n\nWait, but actually, no. Because each term in the second part has a different power of \\(c\\), but in the product, each term will have a different power of \\(c\\), but we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nBut is that correct? Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that is multiplied by 6 (the coefficient from \\(a^2b^2\\)). Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first part, and the second part is just being multiplied as a whole, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part.

So, that means we can treat the second expansion as a single term, but actually, no, because each term in the second expansion is separate.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me approach it differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). We can expand both parts separately and then multiply them together. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, so in the product, it will be multiplied by every term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part contributes a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it adds to the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nSo, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is indeed found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I'm not missing something. Is there a possibility that \\(a^2b^2\\) could also be formed by terms from both expansions? For example, could there be a term in the second expansion that, when multiplied by a term in the first expansion, gives \\(a^2b^2\\)? But no, because the second expansion only involves \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), which don't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Therefore, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the first expansion, and it gets multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let's consider that when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). Each of these has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times each power of \\(c\\). But the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^6\\) is 6 * 1 = 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^4\\) is 6 * 6 = 36, and so on, up to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^{-6}\\) is 6 * 1 = 6.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean we need to sum all these coefficients? Because in the product, each term \\(a^2b^2c^{2k - 6}\\) has a coefficient of 6 times the coefficient from the second expansion. Therefore, the total coefficient for all terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) is the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, yes, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the question was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) (i.e., \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\)), then we would need to find the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, which would require a different approach. But in this case, the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\).

The coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first polynomial is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is 2 (when \\(c = 1\\)), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2, which is correct because the product would have terms like \\(ac\\), \\(ad\\), \\(bc\\), \\(bd\\), and the coefficient of \\(a\\) (i.e., \\(ac + ad\\)) is indeed 2.

But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term is part of the first expansion, \\((a + b)^4\\), right? So maybe I don't need to worry about the second part when looking for \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, but wait, the entire expression is a product of two expansions. So actually, when I multiply them together, the terms from the first expansion will be multiplied by terms from the second expansion. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second part, which only has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't be affected by the second expansion. So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\)? Let me think.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, does that mean I need to consider how \\(a^2b^2\\) interacts with all the terms in the second expansion? Or is it just the coefficient from the first expansion because the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\)? Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.\n\nLet me try to clarify. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by \\(c^6\\), \\(c^5 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c}\\), \\(c^4 \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^2\\), and so on, all the way to \\(\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But when we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we're only interested in the terms where the power of \\(a\\) is 2 and the power of \\(b\\) is 2. However, since the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), all those terms will just be multiplied by constants, but they won't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part? That doesn't seem right because the second expansion has multiple terms, but since they don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), they just act as scalars when multiplied by the first expansion.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those will contribute to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), and then multiply that by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, no, that can't be correct either. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients combine in a specific way. But in this case, since the second polynomial only has \\(c\\) terms, and the first has \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first will be multiplied by each term in the second, but each of those products will have different powers of \\(c\\). However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\n\nWait, let me think differently. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the total coefficient would be the product of the two coefficients.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm wrong, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), because the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, maybe the coefficient remains the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\). But that seems too simplistic, given that the problem includes the second expansion. So, perhaps I need to consider both parts.\n\nWait, let me try to compute this more carefully. Let's first find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^4 \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). So, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs is when \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNow, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand this. Using the binomial theorem, it's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) (which is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, which are \\(\\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) for m from 0 to 6.\n\nSo, the product will have terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) for each m. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that means we need to collect all the terms where the power of \\(a\\) is 2 and the power of \\(b\\) is 2, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, each of these terms will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a different power of \\(c\\), but since the problem just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to sum all the coefficients from the second expansion and multiply by the coefficient from the first expansion.\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me clarify. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, resulting in multiple terms with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). But when the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's considering all possible terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first expansion.\n\nWait, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, setting \\(c = 1\\), the sum of coefficients is \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, when we expand the entire product, any term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from the first expansion (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion (which is 64), giving 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, that doesn't seem right because in the product, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which contributes a coefficient, so the total coefficient is 6 times (sum of coefficients in second expansion).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) being 6, and then the entire second expansion is a scalar multiple, so the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, let me think differently. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient in the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that's not exactly right because the second expansion is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the coefficient is just 6, because the second expansion doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, no, that can't be right because when you multiply by the second expansion, you're effectively scaling the first expansion by the entire second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check this with an example. Suppose the second expansion was just 1, then the coefficient would be 6. If the second expansion was 2, then the coefficient would be 12. So, in general, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient in the first expansion times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion. So, in this case, sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each contributing their own coefficient. Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible \\(c\\) terms is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let's compute the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think of the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are \\(\\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) for m from 0 to 6. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion (which is 6) times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire second expansion, because the second expansion doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a scalar. So, perhaps that's not the right way to think about it.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to compute the product more directly. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) has a coefficient of 6. Then, when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each of those terms, resulting in terms like \\(6 \\times \\binom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm wrong and the coefficient is just 6, because the second expansion doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that can't be right because the second expansion is being multiplied, so it scales the entire first expansion. So, the coefficients in the first expansion are multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, let me try to think of it as a product of two polynomials. The first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the coefficients of the terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are scaled by the entire second polynomial. But when the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nSo, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with a simpler example. Suppose we have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion would be \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 2, so 1 * 2 = 2. But if I expand it, the terms are \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) in this product is the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first expansion (which is 1) times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion (which is 2), so 1 * 2 = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would be 1 * 2 = 2. So, that seems to check out.\n\nSimilarly, if I take \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be \\(\\binom{2}{2} = 1\\) times 2, so 2. Expanding, we get \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2ab c + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 1 * 2 = 2, which matches. So, this seems to confirm that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given problem is indeed 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the sum of coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Let me compute the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and see what the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is. Since the second expansion has terms involving \\(c\\), when I multiply, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are \\(\\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) for m from 0 to 6. Therefore, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\) is 6 * \\(\\binom{6}{m}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that means we need to sum all the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2 c^{k}\\) for all k. So, that would be 6 * \\(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\binom{6}{m}\\). But \\(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\binom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think about it as the coefficient being 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but another way to see it is that the product of two polynomials is the sum over all possible products of terms from each polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum over all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. Since the second expansion doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, each such multiplication just scales the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by the coefficient from the second expansion. Therefore, the total coefficient is the coefficient from the first expansion times the sum of coefficients from the second expansion.\n\nSo, yes, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion is given by \\(\\binom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\).

Since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, I need to consider how the second part affects it. But wait, the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when I multiply the two expansions together, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms will multiply each term from the second expansion.

Wait, no, that's not quite right.\n\nWait, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will multiply all terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient will be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so plugging \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) be 6 * 64 = 384? Hmm, but that seems too large. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct because the second expansion isn't just a scalar multiplier; each term in the second expansion is multiplied by each term in the first expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second expansion doesn't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 multiplied by the entire second expansion's value, but that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is a polynomial, not a scalar. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, the rest of the variables (involving \\(c\\)) don't affect those exponents. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will contribute to the overall coefficient, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nTo find the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, we can set \\(c = 1\\), which gives:\n\n\\[\n\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.

Another way to think about it is that the second polynomial \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded, and each term will have some power of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When we multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term will be \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k \\times c^{-m}\\) or something like that. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient will indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial because each term in the second polynomial contributes a factor that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, yes, the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try another approach. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and its coefficient is 6, as calculated earlier. The \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part, when expanded, has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). Each of these terms, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will give a term like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) or anything with \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because the question is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) terms. So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second expansion. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term with a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), you'd get a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is not 6 times the sum of all coefficients, but rather 6 times the coefficient of the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because only the constant term in the second expansion (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms in the second expansion will introduce a \\(c\\) term, which would make the overall term have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is not what we're looking for. So, I think I made a mistake earlier by considering the sum of all coefficients. Instead, I should only consider the coefficient of the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nSo, let's correct that. The second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's find the coefficient of the constant term, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so:\n\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of the constant term in the second expansion is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from the first expansion (which is 6) multiplied by the coefficient of the constant term in the second expansion (which is 20). So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, earlier I thought it was 384, but that was incorrect because I was considering all coefficients, but actually, only the constant term contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term without any \\(c\\) terms. So, the correct coefficient is 120.\n\nLet me verify this again. The first part gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second part, when expanded, has a constant term (i.e., term without \\(c\\)) with coefficient 20. So, when you multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, giving a total coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. All other terms from the second expansion would introduce a \\(c\\) term, so they don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the final product.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"

But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), right? Because the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables. So maybe I don't need to worry about the second part when looking for \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nLet me think. So, if I focus on \\((a + b)^4\\), I can expand this using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem states that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^{k}\\). So, in this case, \\(n = 4\\), and I'm looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\). That would be when \\(k = 2\\), because \\(a^{4 - 2}b^{2} = a^2b^2\\). The coefficient for this term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nWait, but the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, I'm not sure. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), when we multiply out the entire expression, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can consider that term separately. \n\nWait, no, actually, when we multiply the two expressions together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, actually, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those terms will have a coefficient, and when you add them all together, you're effectively multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion. \n\nWait, let me check that. Suppose I have two expressions: \\(E = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(F = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, the product \\(E \\times F\\) would have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^mc^{6 - m}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. But we're interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(F\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(E\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(F\\). \n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because each term in \\(E\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(F\\), but when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we're only interested in terms where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if it's multiplied by a term that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). But actually, in the product \\(E \\times F\\), each term is a product of a term from \\(E\\) and a term from \\(F\\). So, for \\(a^2b^2\\) to appear, it must come from a term in \\(E\\) that is \\(a^2b^2\\) times a term in \\(F\\) that is a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) in it, which would make it not just \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but that's not correct either. Because if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which includes all terms, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\). So, actually, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if it's multiplied by a term in \\(F\\) that is \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(E\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(F\\). \n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I found earlier, and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, let's calculate the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me double-check this. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(k = 3\\), giving a coefficient of 20. So, when we multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, resulting in a total coefficient of 120. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility that other terms in the second expansion could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by other terms in the first expansion? For example, if we have a term in the first expansion that's \\(a^kb^{4 - k}\\) and a term in the second expansion that's \\(c^m\\), but \\(c^m\\) doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if it's multiplied by a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), which is the constant term. Therefore, my initial conclusion seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem differently. Let me consider the entire expansion. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not correct because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). But that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384, which contradicts my earlier result. So, I must be making a mistake here. \n\nWait, no, that approach is incorrect because when you set \\(c = 1\\), you get the sum of all coefficients in \\(F\\), but in reality, the product \\(E \\times F\\) would have terms where each term in \\(E\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(F\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(E\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(F\\), because each term in \\(F\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But that would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every possible term in \\(F\\), which would include terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But in reality, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if it's multiplied by the constant term in \\(F\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nBut wait, when I set \\(c = 1\\), I get the sum of all coefficients in \\(F\\), which is 64. So, if I were to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\(E \\times F\\), treating \\(c\\) as 1, then the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that's not the same as the coefficient when considering only the constant term in \\(F\\). So, I'm confused now. \n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify the problem. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in reality, each term in the product will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) raised to some power and \\(c\\) raised to some other power. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(E\\) by a term in \\(F\\) that is a constant, i.e., \\(c^0\\). Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term with \\(c^m\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^m\\), which is a different term. So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is if it's multiplied by \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I expand both expressions fully. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(E\\) is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2. Then, when multiplied by each term in \\(F\\), which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\(F\\) is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when I multiply 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 by each term in \\(F\\), I get terms like 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all coefficients from \\(F\\) multiplied by 6. But wait, no, because each term in \\(F\\) has a different power of \\(c\\), so the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is when \\(k = 3\\), which gives \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, if I were to collect all terms with \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then I would have to sum over all \\(k\\) the coefficients \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), but that's not correct because each term in \\(F\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient would be 6 * sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k} = 6 * 2^6 = 6 * 64 = 384. But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384, which contradicts the earlier result. \n\nWait, but that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term without any \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient when \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in \\(F\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be combined with any power of \\(c\\). But in reality, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), so when you multiply it by terms in \\(F\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2c^m\\) for some \\(m\\). Therefore, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear as a standalone term is if it's multiplied by the constant term in \\(F\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384, which would be the coefficient if we're considering all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term without any \\(c\\). Therefore, the correct approach is to consider only the constant term in \\(F\\), giving 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of it as two separate expansions. The first expansion is \\((a + b)^4\\), which gives terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which gives terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When we multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^m\\), where \\(m\\) is the exponent from the second expansion. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) dependence. Therefore, the only way this can happen is if \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. \n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me confirm this by considering a specific example. Suppose I expand both expressions fully. The first expansion would have terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). The second expansion would have terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). Now, when I multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 6c^4 = 36a^2b^2c^4\\), and so on, down to \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 120a^2b^2\\). Similarly, \\(a^2b^2\\) is also multiplied by terms like \\(15a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), etc. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Therefore, the only term that contributes to this is \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120. \n\nWait, but in my earlier consideration, I thought that setting \\(c = 1\\) would give the sum of all coefficients in \\(F\\), which is 64, and then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that's not correct because when \\(c = 1\\), the entire product becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384. But that's when considering all terms, including those with \\(c\\). However, the problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\). Therefore, the correct approach is to consider only the constant term in \\(F\\), leading to 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nSo, to summarize, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(F\\). The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is given by \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). That seems correct. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning now.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

So, when we expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^kb^{4 - k}\\) multiplied by \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^m \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{6 - m}\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{2m - 6}\\).\n\nBut since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we can treat the second part as a constant when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, that's not correct because when we multiply, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire sum of the second part, but that's not quite right either because the second part is an expansion with multiple terms.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion, but that would make the coefficient a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), which is not a constant. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering the coefficient in the product, which would be 6 multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial in \\(c\\).\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all terms in the second expansion. But that would make the coefficient a sum involving \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are numerical.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to treat the entire second part as a single term, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but that would still be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a number. So, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that the second part is a separate expansion, and when multiplied by the first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all terms in the second expansion. But that doesn't seem right because the sum of all terms in the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I expand both parts separately, I get:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k} a^k b^{4 - k}\n\\]\nand\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{6 - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{2m - 6}\n\\]\n\nSo, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^k b^{4 - k} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{2m - 6}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^k b^{4 - k} c^{2m - 6}\\).\n\nNow, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will come from the terms where \\(k = 2\\) and \\(4 - k = 2\\), which is consistent. So, for \\(k = 2\\), the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, this term will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{2m - 6}\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for all \\(m\\), but that's not correct because each term in the second expansion has a different power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for all \\(m\\), but that would be 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), which is 384. But that can't be right because each term in the second expansion has a different power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually 6 times the entire second expansion, which is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused here. Let me try a different approach. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the coefficient is 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate, but that seems unlikely because the entire expression is a product.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's assuming that the \\(c\\) terms are also to be considered, but only the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the product of the coefficient from the first part and the coefficient from the second part where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.\n\nLet me check that. So, in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(2m - 6\\), as I wrote earlier. So, to get \\(c^0\\), we set \\(2m - 6 = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient from the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I'm overcomplicating again. If the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because coefficients are numerical.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that's still a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120, as I calculated earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating the entire second part as a single term, which would mean the coefficient is 6 times the expansion of the second part, but that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical answer.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look back at the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't mention \\(c\\), so maybe it's expecting me to treat the entire second part as a constant factor when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of the second part, but that would still be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a number.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the second part, but that seems odd because the second part is part of the product.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the second part is just a separate factor that doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to have the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) all in the same expression, and we're supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number, so that can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering all possible \\(k\\), and the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.\n\nWait, but when you set \\(c = 1\\), you get the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, if I multiply that by 6, I get 384. But is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\)? I'm not sure, but maybe that's the intended answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to treat the second part as a separate factor and only consider the coefficient from the first part, which is 6. But that seems too simple, and I don't think that's correct because the entire expression is a product.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but not specifying any power, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that's a polynomial, not a number.\n\nI'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think differently. Maybe I should consider that the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term in the second expansion. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), as I calculated earlier. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nBut the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I'm overcomplicating again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the rest of the terms involving \\(c\\) are separate, so the answer is 6. But that seems too simple, and I think the problem is expecting me to consider the entire product.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that's a polynomial, not a number. So, maybe the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120, as I thought earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the second part is just a separate factor that doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion, but that would still be a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting me to evaluate the second part at a specific value, but that's not indicated.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for similar problems or think about how coefficients work in products of polynomials. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms from each polynomial that multiply together to give that specific term. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. The sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is found by evaluating it at \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that might be the case, but I wasn't sure. Let me verify this approach. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, when multiplying, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times 64, which is 384. That seems correct because each term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of the product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion, but since we're only interested in the numerical coefficient, it's 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit confused because the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), and the problem is only asking about \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe the answer is 6, but I think the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the second part is a separate factor, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, but I think that's not correct because when you multiply, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, let me try to think of a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the first part is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is \\(2^1 = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the product would be 1 times 2, which is 2. That makes sense because expanding \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1)\\) gives \\(a^2(c + 1) + 2ab(c + 1) + b^2(c + 1)\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is indeed 2.\n\nSimilarly, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, so the coefficient in the product is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought of another approach where I considered the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which gave me 120. So, which one is correct? Let me clarify.\n\nIf the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 384. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. But since the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, it's written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's possible that the problem is considering the entire expression as a product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number, which doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the rest is separate, but that seems too simple.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're asked for the coefficient, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nYes, I think that's the correct approach. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit unsure because the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the second part is just a separate factor that doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But that doesn't seem correct because when you multiply, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to treat the second part as a constant, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6. But that seems too simplistic, and I think the correct approach is to consider the entire product, leading to 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the rest is separate, but I think that's not correct.\n\nWait, let me try to think differently. Maybe I should expand both parts and see what the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is.\n\nSo, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), as I did before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{2m - 6}\\). So, when I multiply these two expansions, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{2m - 6}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all terms in the second expansion, which is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number, so that can't be right.\n\nWait, so perhaps the problem is expecting me to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power. As I calculated earlier, that would be 6 times \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nBut the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so maybe I'm overcomplicating again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the rest is separate, but that seems too simple.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look back at the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a number, so perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the rest is separate, but that seems too simplistic. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120.\n\nI think the confusion arises from whether the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\) or specifically when \\(c\\) is raised to a certain power. Since the problem didn't specify, I think the most reasonable interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if the problem is expecting me to consider the entire product, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial, but that doesn't make sense because coefficients are numerical.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the rest is separate, but that seems too simple.\n\nWait, let me think of another approach. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is written incorrectly, and it should be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^{10}\\) or something similar, but as it is, it's \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the rest is separate, but that seems too simplistic. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the rest is separate, so the answer is 6. But that doesn't seem correct because when you multiply, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that's a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting me to evaluate the coefficient at a specific value of \\(c\\), but that's not indicated.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that's a polynomial, so the answer would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the coefficient is 6, and the rest is separate, but that seems too simple.\n\nI'm stuck between two interpretations: either the coefficient is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, giving 384, or it's 6 times the constant term in the second part, giving 120. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is 6, but that seems too simplistic.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for similar problems or think about how coefficients work in products of polynomials. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms from each polynomial that multiply together to give that specific term. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the answer should be 384.\n\nBut earlier I thought of another approach where I considered the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which gave me 120. But I think that's when the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is different from just \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSince the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion is found by first determining the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, we consider the entire second expansion \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the sum of its coefficients by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{384}"

Maybe I should handle each part separately first.\n\nStarting with \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I'm looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), which means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient here is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, the expansion is the sum from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nWait, but since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), does that mean I can ignore the second part? Or does it mean I need to multiply the coefficients from both expansions? Hmm, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think I need to consider how the second part affects it.\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, right? Because the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), so when you multiply them together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the same as the coefficient in the first part times the entire second expansion, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, you're combining all the terms.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that means I need to find all the terms in the product where the power of \\(a\\) is 2, the power of \\(b\\) is 2, and the power of \\(c\\) can be anything. But wait, no, because in the product, each term will have a certain power of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but since the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), I think that's not the case. Maybe I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is a product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of the products of the coefficients from each part where the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by any term from the second part.\n\nWait, that seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because then it would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so that the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems more complex, and perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, 6, because the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Hmm, but that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second.\n\nWait, no, actually, in this case, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that would mean that we take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, because each term in the first part's expansion is multiplied by each term in the second part's expansion. But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product equal to 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a numerical value, so maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible terms, but perhaps the problem is only considering terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., where the power of \\(c\\) is zero. That is, perhaps it's looking for the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part. Let me check that.\n\nSo, if I consider that, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\cdot c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but is that the correct interpretation? The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\), unless specified otherwise. But perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient when considering all terms, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), but that seems odd.\n\nWait, let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the expansion of the first part is multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\right)\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be this entire polynomial. However, that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that seems too complex for a problem that's likely intended to be simpler.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, which would be the same as the coefficient in the first part, because the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term in the second expansion. That would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times the constant term of the second expansion, which is 20, so 6*20=120. That seems more plausible because it gives a numerical coefficient.\n\nSo, to recap, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the constant term from the second part, 20, giving 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and to get the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it's multiplied by the constant term from the second part. Because any other term from the second part would introduce a power of \\(c\\), so if we're only interested in the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), then the coefficient would be 6*20=120. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient when considering only the constant term in \\(c\\), so 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant. But that seems unlikely because the second part is part of the product.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all terms. But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), but that's probably not what the problem is asking for. So, I think the intended interpretation is that we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering only the terms where the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nSo, to summarize, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Similarly, the other part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can also be expanded using the binomial theorem. But wait, the question is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). Let me think about that.\n\nSo, the expression is a product of two binomials: one involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part and \\(c\\) is in the second part, maybe the coefficients for \\(a^2b^2\\) won't be affected by the \\(c\\) terms. That is, when I multiply the two expansions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will multiply with terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, maybe the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients from each part where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are such that they cancel out, leaving a constant term. Wait, but actually, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps I can treat the two parts separately and then multiply their coefficients.\n\nWait, but actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials together, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would come from the product of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if I take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by, say, \\(c^k\\) from the second part, then the resulting term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only occur if the \\(c\\) terms multiply to 1, so that \\(c^k \\cdot (1/c)^m = c^{k - m}\\), and if \\(k = m\\), then that's \\(c^0 = 1\\). So I need to find the constant term in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part and \\(c\\) is in another, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, no, because the variables are separate, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that can't be because the variables are separate, so when you multiply, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second part. So, yes, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^n\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^k\\). So, for \\(n = 4\\), the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(n - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6 and the constant term in the second part is 20, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and is multiplied by the constant term from the other part. So yes, 6 times 20 is 120. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two coefficients, so 6 from the first part and 20 from the second part, giving 120. Yeah, that makes sense. So, I think the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."
