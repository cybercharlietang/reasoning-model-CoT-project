The coefficients for these terms are 6 and 20, respectively, so their product is 120. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations. The binomial coefficients seem correct: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\) and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them gives 120, so I'm confident that's the correct coefficient.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Therefore, the coefficient should indeed be 120. Wait, let me think again. Is there any possibility that other terms in the expansion could result in \\(a^2b^2\\) without involving \\(c\\)? For example, if I take a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) that's not \\(a^2b^2\\) and multiply it by a term from the other polynomial that's not \\(c^0\\), could that somehow result in \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\)? No, because if you take a different term from \\((a + b)^4\\), say \\(a^3b\\), and multiply it by a term from the other polynomial that's \\(c^1\\), you'd get \\(a^3b \\times c^1\\), which is \\(a^3bc\\), which is not \\(a^2b^2\\). Similarly, taking \\(ab^3\\) and multiplying by \\(1/c\\) would give \\(ab^3 \\times 1/c\\), which is \\(ab^3/c\\), which also doesn't contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, only the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial multiplied by the \\(c^0\\) term from the second polynomial will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, my calculation of 6 times 20 equals 120 should be correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both expansions:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."
