Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120. Wait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the entire expression is a product of two polynomials. Each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is of the form \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\) with coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\), and each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is of the form \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\) with coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). So, when we multiply them, each term in the product is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). We are interested in the terms where \\(a^{4 - k}b^k = a^2b^2\\). That implies \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and the corresponding coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for the \\(c\\) part, we need \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\) to be \\(c^0\\), so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) which gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the term we're interested in is \\(6 \\times 20 \\times a^2b^2c^0 = 120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 120. I think that makes sense. So, I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.

Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120. Let me see if there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the entire expression is a product of two independent polynomials, so the coefficients multiply when taking the product. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product would be 6 * 20 = 120, and since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but wait, no, actually, we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps the \\(c\\) terms are irrelevant as long as they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But in this case, since the \\(c\\) terms are multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), but we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would appear in the product as \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first polynomial, and when multiplied by the second polynomial, it would create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., depending on the term from the second polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only occur if the second polynomial contributes a \\(c^0\\) term. Because if you have \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would only exist if \\(k = 0\\). So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is by multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) with the constant term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's solid. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\nWait, just to be thorough, let me consider another approach. Suppose I expand both parts separately and then look for the coefficient. Let's see:\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that:\n\nUsing the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} (1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, the terms are:\n\n- \\(m = 0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1 \\times c^6\\)\n- \\(m = 1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^{4} = 6c^4\\)\n- \\(m = 2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^{2} = 15c^2\\)\n- \\(m = 3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\)\n- \\(m = 4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(m = 5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(m = 6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first will be multiplied by each term in the second, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), etc. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, that's the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term 20. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, you need to consider all possible ways to get \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, the second polynomial doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms; it only has \\(c\\) terms. So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term in the second polynomial, you'll get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1/c^k\\), but not just \\(a^2b^2\\) unless \\(k = 0\\). So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is by multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part with the constant term (c^0) from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. So, I think that's the correct answer. Just to recap: - Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. - Coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. - Multiply them together: 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by multiplying the coefficients from each part of the expression. \n\n1. From \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. From \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nMultiplying these coefficients gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " So, the only contribution comes from the constant term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only present in the first polynomial, and when multiplied by the constant term from the second, it remains as \\(a^2b^2\\). Any other term from the second polynomial would add a power of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would make the product have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or similar, but not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, only the constant term from the second polynomial would contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120.
