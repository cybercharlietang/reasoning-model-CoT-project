So, the first part gives 6, the second part gives 20, and multiplying them gives 120. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe I should think about it another way. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply for the corresponding terms. So, in this case, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can treat the second polynomial as a scalar when considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But actually, it's not a scalar; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\), but we only care about the constant term in that polynomial because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which we don't want in our final term \\(a^2b^2\\). So, it's correct that we need the constant term from the second polynomial, which is 20, and then multiply it by the coefficient from the first polynomial, which is 6, giving 120. I think that's correct. Let me just check my calculations again. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), that's correct. For the second part, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), that's also correct.

    "text": " Let me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(c\\) equal to \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, because we're looking for \\(c^0\\). So, we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the one with \\(c^0\\). The coefficient for this term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found. So, that would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Let me just double-check that I didn't make any mistakes. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 because \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120.
