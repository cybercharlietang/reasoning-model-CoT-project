But since we're only interested in the term where the \\(c\\) exponent is 0, that means we're only considering the term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) where \\(c^0\\), which is 20. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by 20, giving 6*20=120. Yeah, that seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by multiplying the binomial coefficients from each part. \n\n1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

The binomial expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(c\\) equal to \\(6 - 2k\\). I need to find the value of \\(k\\) such that \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), because that will give me the term with \\(c^0\\). Solving for \\(k\\): \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) \u2192 \\(2k = 6\\) \u2192 \\(k = 3\\). So, the term where \\(k = 3\\) is the one with \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) and 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, multiplying them together: 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120. Wait a second, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, I found that in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, correct. Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20, correct. So, when I multiply these two, it's 6 * 20, which is 120. Yeah, that seems right. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that the entire expression is the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) gives the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, yeah, I think that's correct. So, the answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by considering the product of the coefficients from each part of the expression. \n\n1.

The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m}\\) because \\(\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = c^{-m}\\). So, combining the exponents, it's \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\).
