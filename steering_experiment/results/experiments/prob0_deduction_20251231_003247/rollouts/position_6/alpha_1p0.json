    "text": " The binomial coefficients for \\(n = 4\\) are 1, 4, 6, 4, 1. So, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) here is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how that multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, but wait, the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), right? So, when I multiply out the entire expression, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), I think that term will only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term (if any) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so when I multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the other expansion, but only the constant term will result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) terms. So, first, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6a\u00b2b\u00b2. Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(k=3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when I multiply 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 by 20, I get 120a\u00b2b\u00b2. So, the coefficient is 120. That seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes here. Yeah, I think that's the right answer.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The constant term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

But wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression is the product of these two expansions. Therefore, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider how the terms from \\((a + b)^4\\) interact with the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait a second, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, its coefficient in the final product will be the coefficient from the first expansion times the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's possible that the question is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, when you multiply out the entire expression, how many times does \\(a^2b^2\\) appear, considering all possible terms from the second expansion. But actually, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), when you multiply it by any term from the second expansion, it will just carry the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit odd because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient, not something involving \\(c\\).\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), and the entire expression is a product of two separate expansions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are numerical, not expressions involving variables. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That would make more sense because then we're looking for a specific term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1.\n\nSo, to clarify, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense because it's looking for a specific term that involves both \\(a^2b^2\\) and \\(c^0\\). Therefore, I need to find the term in the product where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second expansion.\n\nFirst, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already determined is 6. Next, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Once we have both coefficients, we can multiply them together to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression.\n\nSo, let's focus on \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, we can expand this as:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set the exponent equal to 0:\n\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies 2k = 6 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the term where \\(k = 3\\) is the constant term. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\n\\]\n\nWait, let me check that calculation again because 6! is 720, and 3! is 6, so 6!/(3!3!) = 720/(6*6) = 720/36 = 20. Yes, that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Since these two terms are multiplied together in the product, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". If it's only considering \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then technically, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would result in a polynomial where each term has a coefficient of 6 times the corresponding binomial coefficient. But that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't a single number but a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, that doesn't make sense because coefficients are typically numerical, not expressions. Therefore, it's more likely that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a function of \\(c\\), which seems unlikely. So, I think the intended interpretation is that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nLet me double-check my steps to ensure I didn't make a mistake. First, I expanded \\((a + b)^4\\) and found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) to be 6. Then, I expanded \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and found the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) to be 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first polynomial and not in the second, but the second polynomial contributes a factor that is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be 6 multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient isn't a single number. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nYes, I think that's the right approach. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of whatever term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) we're interested in.

So, does that mean that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply by each term, you're effectively scaling the coefficient by each term's coefficient. Wait, but actually, no, because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to consider how the multiplication affects it. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two expressions, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

Because when you multiply by each term, you're adding up all the coefficients from the second expansion. \n\nWait, but actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients combine. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But what is the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)? To find that, I can substitute \\(c = 1\\), because substituting 1 for all variables gives the sum of the coefficients. Let me check that. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so it's being multiplied by every possible term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and since the second part is multiplied by it, and we don't care about the \\(c\\) terms, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. That makes sense.\n\nWait, but let me double-check by expanding a bit more. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would have terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(1/c^6\\), each with their own coefficients. For example, the first few terms would be \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^5 \\times 1/c\\), which is \\(6c^4\\), then \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^4 \\times (1/c)^2 = 15c^2\\), and so on. The sum of all these coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\), as I thought before, which is 64. So, the sum of the coefficients is 64, so 6 * 64 is indeed 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, since each term in the second polynomial will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but another way to approach this is to consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term.

So, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) gives me:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\nSo, from this expansion, I can see that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. That seems straightforward. Now, the expression also has another part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider how this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait a second, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but the expression is a product of two parts: one involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, their exponents don't interfere with each other. That means the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part doesn't get multiplied by any terms in the second part that would change its exponent. So, when I multiply the two expressions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part remains the same, and it gets multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, no, actually, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what happens with \\(c\\). So, maybe I don't need to consider the second part at all? But that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product of both parts. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when I multiply it by the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it will just be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think I need to consider all the terms in the second part and how they interact with \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, that might not be right. Actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term on its own, and when multiplied by the second expression, it will result in terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's implying that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, the coefficient will be the same as in the first part, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the entire second expression, it's like distributing \\(a^2b^2\\) across all the terms in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from the second part. But wait, that doesn't seem right either. Let me clarify: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms from each polynomial that multiply together to give the desired term. In this case, the desired term is \\(a^2b^2\\). Since the first polynomial only has terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second polynomial only has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), there are no overlapping variables that would combine to form \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But wait, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire second polynomial, which doesn't make sense because we're looking for a specific coefficient, not a polynomial. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will multiply each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is the exponent from the second expansion. However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, it's asking for the sum of all coefficients of terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) part. Therefore, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But the sum of all coefficients in the second part is simply the value of the second polynomial when \\(c = 1\\), because substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (the sum of coefficients from the second part), which equals 384. Wait, but that seems too high. Let me check that again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we're treating \\(c\\) as another variable and just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which isn't the case. Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe I need to think differently. Let's consider that when we multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms from each polynomial that combine to form that specific term. In this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial and any term in the second polynomial. Since the second polynomial doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second polynomial. As I calculated earlier, the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me verify this. Let's compute the second polynomial's expansion. The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, this expands to:\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nSo, the coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for each term \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\). The sum of all coefficients is when we set \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, yes, the sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then when I write out the product, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which are \\(c^6, 6c^4, 15c^2, 20, 15c^{-2}, 6c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of the products of the coefficients from each part. Since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficients in the second part are 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1, the total coefficient would be 6*(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6*64 = 384. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, if I'm misunderstanding the problem and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we're treating \\(c\\) as another variable and just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by each coefficient in the second polynomial, but that would result in a polynomial, which doesn't make sense for a coefficient. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that the coefficient is 384. So, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{384}\n\\]"

    "text": " The expansion will have terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\), each multiplied by a binomial coefficient. So, the general term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\), where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), right? So, when I multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not considering \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part, so perhaps the second part doesn't affect it? Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is a product, so when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second polynomial doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will just be multiplied by the entire second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, each term would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some term involving \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the product will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^{-m}\\), etc., but since the question is only about \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be 6 times \\(2^6\\) because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has coefficients that add up to \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 would be 384. But wait, that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The problem might just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, so the coefficient would be a polynomial itself, not a single number. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, so \\(c^0 = 1\\). That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make much sense as a coefficient. So, maybe I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), and then multiply that by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. So, let me work on that.\n\nFirst, let's find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\). Using the binomial theorem again, each term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\). Calculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Since we're looking for the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), the overall coefficient would be the product of these two, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", but if we're considering the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So, unless the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient when the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so I think it's more likely that they want the coefficient when the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\), so that the term is just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this. If I don't consider the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6, but that seems too simple. Alternatively, if I consider that the entire expression is a product, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed involve multiplying by the entire expansion of the second term, but that would result in a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is only asking about the coefficient in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, but that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. So, maybe I should stick with the earlier conclusion that the coefficient is 120, considering the \\(c^0\\) term.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be interpreted as finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Let me write out the product: \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Each term in the product is a combination of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense as a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression, but treating \\(c\\) as a variable separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times (c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6). But that seems too complicated, and the problem is likely expecting a numerical answer, so I must be overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is intended to be interpreted as finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, but the question is only about \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), giving 384. But that seems high, and I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient in the first part, which is 6, but that seems too easy.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I can treat the entire expression as a product of two polynomials and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the entire second polynomial, so the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's not a number. Therefore, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient when the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, so that the term is just \\(a^2b^2\\), and that coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nYes, I think that's the right approach. So, to recap: In \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 120, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part. \n\n1. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) (i.e., the constant term) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiplying these coefficients together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

But wait, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I can't just stop here; I need to consider the entire expression. However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that comes from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so it's only in terms of \\(c\\). Therefore, when I multiply the two expressions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not any specific term involving \\(c\\), I think I just need the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and then multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part because every term in the second expansion will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, and the coefficients get multiplied. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. However, when you collect like terms, \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since the problem doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), I think it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would be a sum of terms involving different powers of \\(c\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a single term in the product. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply the two expressions, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when multiplied by 6, it will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, I need to find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial, you can substitute \\(c = 1\\). Let me check that: if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me think again: the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6a^2b^2. When I multiply this by the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the second part is a coefficient times some power of c. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion because each term in the second expansion will multiply the 6a^2b^2 term, effectively contributing 6 times each coefficient. Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. Let me just double-check my reasoning. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting c = 1, which gives 2^6 = 64. Therefore, when you multiply the two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that makes sense. I don't think I missed anything here. So, the final answer should be 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.

Hmm, that seems more likely. So, in other words, I need to find all terms in the expansion where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), and sum up their coefficients. But wait, actually, in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Hmm, maybe I'm misinterpreting the question. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the coefficient where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That would make more sense because then we're looking for a specific term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each expansion where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) multiply to give \\(c^0\\).

That would be the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is equal to the exponent of \\(1/c\\), so that when multiplied, they cancel out. Let me denote \\(k\\) as the number of times \\(c\\) is taken in the expansion, and \\(6 - k\\) as the number of times \\(1/c\\) is taken. So, the exponent of \\(c\\) would be \\(k - (6 - k) = 2k - 6\\). We want this exponent to be 0, so \\(2k - 6 = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the term where \\(k = 3\\) will give \\(c^0\\). The coefficient for this term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\) from the second part, the overall coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Let me double-check this. In the first expansion, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when we have 3 \\(c\\)s and 3 \\(1/c\\)s, which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120, so that seems correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) has a coefficient of 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Calculating the coefficients, that's \\(1a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider the expansion of that part as well. Maybe I should first figure out the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then see how it interacts with the first expansion. Let me try that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, it becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, I need to multiply this by the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already found. So, the entire expression is \\((1a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4) \\times \\left(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\right)\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only appears in the first part, right? Wait, no, because when you multiply the two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion. Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term remains as is, and the coefficients add up. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in a binomial expansion \\((x + y)^n\\) is found by setting \\(x = 1\\) and \\(y = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^n = 2^n\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, does that make sense? Let me check again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms with different powers of c, but when you multiply it by the first expansion, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second. However, since the question only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of c, then yes, every term in the second expansion will just multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, effectively scaling it by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. So, the total coefficient is indeed 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, I could think of it as the product of the coefficients from each expansion, since the variables are independent. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that seems right.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\).

So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. But wait, the original expression is the product of two parts: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how these two parts interact.\n\nWait, but the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, so that term is only in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which involves variables c and 1/c. So, when I multiply these two expressions together, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to see how this term interacts with the second part.\n\nWait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve c or 1/c. So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, the resulting term will still be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of c or 1/c. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any c's. So, does that mean that only the term where the second part is 1 (i.e., the constant term) will contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any c's?\n\nWait, but actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, perhaps I need to find all terms in the product where the power of a is 2, the power of b is 2, and the powers of c and 1/c multiply to give a term that doesn't involve c at all. So, maybe I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. That way, the constant term would not introduce any c's, so the resulting term would be \\(6 \\times \\text{constant term} \\times a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, let me try that approach. First, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do this, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nWe are looking for the term where the exponent of c is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\):\n\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\\\\n2k = 6 \\\\\nk = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. Therefore, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part has a coefficient of 6, and the constant term in the second part is 20. When we multiply these together, the term becomes \\(6 \\times 20 \\times a^2b^2\\), which is \\(120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the first part gives me \\(6a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives me a constant term of 20. So, when I multiply them, it's 6 * 20 = 120, and the term is \\(120a^2b^2\\). That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about it differently. Since the two parts are multiplied together, every term in the expansion will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve c, the only way that happens is if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion. So, that's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, is there another way this could happen? For example, could there be other terms where the c's cancel out, but the a and b exponents are 2 each? Let me think. Suppose I have a term from the first expansion that's \\(a^2b^2\\), and a term from the second expansion that's \\(c^k \\times (1/c)^{6 - k}\\), which is \\(c^{2k - 6}\\). So, for the exponents of c to cancel out, \\(2k - 6 = 0\\), which gives k = 3, as before. So, only when k = 3, the term is constant. Therefore, only the term where k = 3 contributes to the constant term, which is 20. So, yes, only that term will contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me just check my binomial coefficients again to make sure I didn't make a mistake there. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term when k = 3 is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{6 - 3} \\times (1/c)^3 = 20c^{3} \\times 1/c^3 = 20c^{0} = 20\\). That's correct.\n\nAnd for \\((a + b)^4\\), the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). So, that's correct too.\n\nSo, I think my answer is correct. The coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we start by expanding each part separately using the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\):\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\n\nThe term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\):\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nWe need the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero):\n\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\n\nThe constant term is:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nNow, we multiply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion (which is 6) by the constant term from the second expansion (which is 20):\n\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"

So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I can't just stop here. I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nHmm, so when I multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to see if the multiplication with \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) affects the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. \n\nWait a minute, let me think. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's a separate part from the \\(c\\) terms. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables from \\(c\\), their exponents won't interfere. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, is that right? Actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply only if the variables are the same, but in this case, the variables are different. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since none of those terms have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't change. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will remain as \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by various terms involving \\(c\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, let me clarify. When you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the terms that combine to form that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be formed by multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) with each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since each term in the second expansion is a power of \\(c\\) (either positive or negative), they don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, each term in the second expansion will just multiply the entire \\(a^2b^2\\) term, but since we're only interested in the coefficient, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second part. \n\nWait, no. Actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, and the coefficients multiply. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first polynomial, and the second polynomial has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^5 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c}\\), etc., none of these terms have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, you'll get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^5 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c}\\), etc. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\), I think I'm misunderstanding something here. \n\nWait, no. Actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, but each of those terms is a power of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would appear multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, that makes sense because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is scaled by the entire expansion of the second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's equivalent to multiplying the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nSo, let me calculate the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of coefficients, I can substitute \\(c = 1\\) because that makes each term equal to its coefficient. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is 64. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (from the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the key idea is that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the terms that combine to form that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, each of which is a power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will have coefficients equal to the original coefficient in the first polynomial multiplied by each coefficient in the second polynomial. \n\nBut since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we're essentially summing over all possible coefficients from the second polynomial. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\) is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64. Hence, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product being equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But since the second polynomial doesn't contain \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's just a scalar multiple. So, the coefficient would be 6 * \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the concept. Let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. In this case, since the first polynomial has terms with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second polynomial has terms with \\(c\\), the variables are different. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be formed by multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial with each term from the second polynomial. However, since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), each of these products will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the overall product. \n\nSo, essentially, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will result in a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), where \\(k\\) is the exponent from the second polynomial. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum all these contributions. \n\nTherefore, the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is indeed 64, as calculated before by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me verify this with a different approach to make sure I'm not making a mistake. Another way to think about it is to consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that term. In this case, since the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all distinct, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial with each term from the second polynomial. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. Since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is 6, and the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if I were to expand the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), etc. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum all these coefficients. \n\nTo find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), as I did before, substitute \\(c = 1\\). That gives \\( (1 + 1)^6 = 64 \\). Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nI think this makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Now, the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6 in this part. But wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I can't just stop here; I need to consider the entire product.\n\nHmm, so I think I need to find the term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that will multiply with \\(a^2b^2\\) such that when I multiply the two expansions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is determined by the product of the coefficients from each expansion, but only if the terms from the second expansion don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, that might not make sense. Let me think again.\n\nWait, actually, when I multiply two polynomials together, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), and the first part is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), they don't interfere with each other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second, but the coefficients add up. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, actually, no. Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables independent of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because then it would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that when I multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so each of those products will have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only consider the terms where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\). Wait, that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term in the product, and in the entire product, each term will have some combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term will be of the form \\((a^k b^{4 - k}) \\times (c^m \\times \\text{something})\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which is a sum of terms in \\(c\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. So, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible terms, but that seems unclear. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, so \\(c^0 = 1\\). That would make more sense because then we can have a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and no \\(c\\). So, let me assume that's what the problem is asking for: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\).\n\nOkay, so with that in mind, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, I can separate the two parts because they are independent. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, as I found earlier. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Once I have that, I can multiply it by 6 to get the final coefficient.\n\nSo, let's work on expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, this expansion is the sum from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\), where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. Now, I need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because that's the term that will multiply with \\(a^2b^2\\) to give a term with \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, I need to solve for \\(m\\) in the equation \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Let's do that:\n\n\\(6 - 2m = 0\\)\n\nSubtract 6 from both sides:\n\n\\(-2m = -6\\)\n\nDivide both sides by -2:\n\n\\(m = 3\\)\n\nSo, when \\(m = 3\\), the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, giving a term \\(6 \\times 20 \\times a^2b^2c^0 = 120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. Let me verify \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). That's correct.\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). That's also correct.\n\nSo, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there another way this could be approached? For example, perhaps considering the entire expansion and looking for terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so that can't be right. Therefore, I think my initial approach is correct: the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) where the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\).\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem and find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20.\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together to get 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me think if there's any other interpretation of the problem. For instance, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of the entire expression, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. But the problem asks for the coefficient, which is typically a number, so that suggests that the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), meaning that we treat \\(c\\) as a separate variable and consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve all possible powers of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a single number. So, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, resulting in a term without \\(c\\), hence the coefficient is 120.\n\nYes, I think that's the correct approach. So, I'm confident that the answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\):\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, we expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results**:\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

I need the term where the exponent of \\(a\\) is 2 and the exponent of \\(b\\) is 2. That means \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I think this also can be expanded using the binomial theorem. The general term here would be \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\), where \\(m\\) goes from 0 to 6. Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).

So, I need to consider that when I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, but wait, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, right? So, when I multiply it by the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is in terms of \\(c\\), the variables are different. So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times whatever the coefficient of the corresponding term in the other expansion? Wait, no, because the other expansion is in terms of \\(c\\), and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables. So, when I multiply the two expansions together, the terms will involve both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) from the first part and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) from the second part. But the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means we're looking for the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of what happens with \\(c\\). But wait, if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then in the product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that right? Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only from the first part, and the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is in the second part for the term that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). But wait, no, because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is 6a^2b^2, and when you multiply it by the entire second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the resulting terms will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when you multiply by 6a^2b^2, each of those coefficients contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to compute 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Hmm, but wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I should think of the entire product as a product of two separate expansions, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, so when multiplied by the second part, each term in the second part will contribute a coefficient that, when multiplied by 6, will give the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times the respective \\(c\\) term. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficients add up. Therefore, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is indeed 64, so 6*64=384. But wait, let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the constant term in the second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you're effectively scaling it by each term in the second expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) power. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try a different approach. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanding this, each term will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion, which is 6a^2b^2, and multiply it by every term in the second expansion. Each term in the second expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient for each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), and the variable part is \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when we multiply 6a^2b^2 by each of these terms, we get terms of the form 6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2k}. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum over all k of 6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}, because each term contributes 6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of c. So, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for k from 0 to 6. But the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) from k=0 to 6 is \\(2^6 = 64\\), as I thought earlier. So, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Wait, but let me make sure. Let me compute the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion again. The sum is when c=1, so \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\).

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all terms in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that combine to form that specific term. But in this case, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, actually, the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). That means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if I have \\( (a + b)^4 = A \\) and \\( \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = B \\), then the product \\( A \\times B \\) will have terms like \\( a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^n} \\) or something like that. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all different variables, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if we multiply the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\(A\\) by any term from \\(B\\), because the other variables don't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(B\\), you just get \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in \\(B\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient in \\(A\\) times the sum of the coefficients in \\(B\\). So, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A = (a + b)^4\\), which we already found as 6. Next, we need to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(B = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial, you can substitute 1 for all variables. So, let me set \\(c = 1\\). Then, \\(B\\) becomes \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\(A \\times B\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Is the sum of the coefficients in \\(B\\) really 64? Let me check that again. When \\(c = 1\\), \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of it as the sum of the coefficients in \\(B\\) being equal to evaluating \\(B\\) at \\(c = 1\\), which is indeed 64. So, then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by 64, which is 384. Therefore, the answer should be 384. Wait, but let me think again. Is that the correct approach? Because in the product \\(A \\times B\\), each term in \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\), since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, yes, that makes sense. So, 6 times 64 is 384. Alternatively, if I were to write out the product, every term in \\(A\\) would be multiplied by every term in \\(B\\), so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\(A\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(B\\), contributing 6 times each coefficient in \\(B\\), which adds up to 6 times 64, which is 384. So, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Calculating the coefficients: \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} = 1\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} = 4\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} = 4\\), and \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} = 1\\). So, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). \n\nNow, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Looking at the expansion, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient is 6. But wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does this mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Hmm, actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. But in this case, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only comes from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, so when we multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That is, when we multiply everything out, what's the coefficient for the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit confusing because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term contributes a coefficient, and all those coefficients add up when you consider the entire product. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, as the other part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, when you multiply, each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that multiplies \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nNow, how do I find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me consider an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding this, we get \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. Wait, no, that's not right because in the product, each term is multiplied by each term. So, in the expansion, \\(a^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), \\(2ab\\) is multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), and \\(b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the terms are \\(a^2c\\), \\(a^2/c\\), \\(2ab c\\), \\(2ab/c\\), \\(b^2c\\), \\(b^2/c\\). There's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term because that would require multiplying \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\), but in the product, you only multiply terms from the same polynomial. So, in this case, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term isn't present because you can't multiply \\(a^2\\) with \\(b^2\\) when they're in separate factors. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, in the original problem, it's \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\((c + 1/c)^6\\). So, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in another. So, when you multiply them, you can't get a term that has both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) unless they come from the same expansion. But in this case, since the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) in another, when you multiply, the variables are separate. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, and it would be multiplied by each term from \\((c + 1/c)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, so 384.\n\nWait, but in my earlier example, when I had \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because you can't get \\(a^2b^2\\) from the product. But in that case, the expansion doesn't include \\(a^2b^2\\) because you can only get terms where the variables come from the same factor. So, in the original problem, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one factor, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) in another, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only present in the first factor, and it's multiplied by each term in the second factor. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second factor, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\), then when I expand it, each term will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, for example, \\(a^4\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^4c^6\\), \\(a^4c^4\\), etc. Similarly, \\(a^3b\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in \\(a^3bc^6\\), \\(a^3bc^4\\), etc. The same goes for \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (the coefficient from the first part) times the sum of the coefficients from the second part, which is 64, giving 384. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not confusing coefficients with terms. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the same as the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second part's expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient is 6, because the rest of the terms involve \\(c\\). But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients from the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let me consider the entire expression as a product of two separate expansions. The first is \\((a + b)^4\\), which gives us terms up to \\(a^4\\) and \\(b^4\\). The second is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which gives us terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\). When we multiply these two, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) times the sum of the coefficients from the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps it's simply 6, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, the coefficients do combine. So, for example, if I have \\(6a^2b^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nLet me verify this with a smaller example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\). So, the product is \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2ab c + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). Now, in this product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, in this case, the coefficient is zero, not 2 times the sum of coefficients in the second part. Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because you can't get \\(a^2b^2\\) from the product of two separate factors.\n\nWait, so in the original problem, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one factor and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in another, you can't get a term that has both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) unless they come from the same factor. So, in the product, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is if both \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) come from the same factor, which they do, but then they are multiplied by each term from the second factor. So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second factor, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second factor, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut in my earlier small example, when I had \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) was zero because you can't get \\(a^2b^2\\) from the product. So, why is that different? Because in that case, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the same factor, but when you multiply by the second factor, you can't get \\(a^2b^2\\) because that would require multiplying \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\), but in the product, you can only multiply terms from each factor. Wait, no, that's not correct because in the first factor, you have \\(a^2\\), \\(2ab\\), and \\(b^2\\). So, when you multiply by the second factor, each of these terms is multiplied by each term in the second factor. So, the term \\(2ab\\) is multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), resulting in \\(2abc\\) and \\(2ab/c\\). There's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term because you can't multiply \\(a^2\\) by \\(b^2\\) when they're in separate factors. Wait, no, in the first factor, \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) are separate terms, so when you multiply by the second factor, you can't get \\(a^2b^2\\) because that would require multiplying \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) together, but they are in the same factor. Wait, no, that's not possible because each term from the first factor is multiplied by each term from the second factor. So, in the first factor, the term \\(a^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second factor, resulting in \\(a^2c\\) and \\(a^2/c\\). Similarly, the term \\(2ab\\) is multiplied by each term in the second factor, resulting in \\(2abc\\) and \\(2ab/c\\). The term \\(b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second factor, resulting in \\(b^2c\\) and \\(b^2/c\\). So, there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product because you can't multiply \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) together when they're in the same factor. Wait, no, that's not correct because in the first factor, \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) are separate terms, so when you multiply by the second factor, you can't combine them into \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the first factor is \\((a + b)^4\\), which includes a term \\(6a^2b^2\\). When you multiply this by the second factor, each term in the second factor is multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second factor, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but in the small example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) was zero because you couldn't form \\(a^2b^2\\) from the product. So, why is the original problem different? Because in the original problem, the first factor has a term with \\(a^2b^2\\), whereas in the small example, the first factor didn't have a \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, in the original problem, since the first factor has \\(a^2b^2\\), when you multiply by the second factor, you get terms with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second factor. So, in the original problem, the coefficient is 384, whereas in the small example, the coefficient is zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first factor.\n\nSo, to sum up, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me calculate the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of coefficients, I can substitute \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you have two separate factors, the coefficient of a term that only appears in one factor is multiplied by the entire second factor. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first factor, so when you multiply by the second factor, you get \\(6a^2b^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\((c + 1/c)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second factor, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the rest of the terms involve \\(c\\), but that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, the coefficients combine. So, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Let me consider the entire expression as a product of two polynomials. The first polynomial is \\(P(a, b) = (a + b)^4\\), and the second is \\(Q(c) = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply them, each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), resulting in \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we start by expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\n\nThe term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, in this expansion, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, no, because the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\), while \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is when the second term is \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me compute that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the term where \\(k = 3\\) will be the constant term. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 20, which is 120. Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, so when you multiply these two parts together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) remains 6, but it's multiplied by 20, giving 120. So, the final coefficient is 120. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, and the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion would be when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). But that's not correct because we're only interested in the term where \\(c^0\\), not the sum. So, I think my first approach is correct. The coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by first expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem, yielding a term \\(6a^2b^2\\). Next, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

But wait, the original problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That means I have to multiply this expansion by another expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient I found, 6, is just for the first part. But since I'm multiplying two expressions together, I need to consider how that affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, actually, wait a second. When I multiply two polynomials, the coefficients of the terms in the product are the products of the coefficients of the terms being multiplied. But in this case, I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only comes from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), because the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. So, actually, when I multiply the two expressions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expression, and I multiply it by every term in the second expression, each of those products will be a term in the final product. However, the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that we're looking for the term where the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are exactly 2 each. But in the second expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), there are no \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expression, you're just adding a factor that includes \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression will be multiplied by each term in the second expression, but none of those terms will affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that doesn't make sense because the entire expansion is a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, we're looking for all terms in the product where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, and then summing their coefficients. In that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expression, each of those terms contributes a different power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient for each of those terms is just the coefficient from the second expansion. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. Let me check that. The sum of the coefficients in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), can be found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\) into the second expression, I get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) times 64 (the sum of coefficients in the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again. When you have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, each of these terms will result in a term like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product isn't just a single number because \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), meaning we're looking for all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, and then summing their coefficients. In that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. As I calculated earlier, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64, so the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), then we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the middle term, which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. To find that, we can use the binomial theorem again. The general term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) times 20 (from the second part), which is 120. But wait, the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), it just asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\)? Or is it considering only the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power? I'm a bit confused now. Let me re-examine the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, we're looking for all terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and then summing their coefficients. Since each such term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), the coefficient for each of these terms will be 6 times the coefficient of that specific power of \\(c\\) in the second expansion. Therefore, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. As I calculated earlier, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. But I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so it's 384. Wait, but let me think about how the product works. When you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the result is that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each of these, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is not a single number because \\(a^2b^2\\) appears in multiple terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then we need to sum all the coefficients of terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. As I found earlier, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384. Alternatively, if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. But since the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think the intended answer is 384. Let me check that again. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any mention of \\(c\\). So, in the context of polynomial expressions, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term that doesn't involve another variable, it usually means that you're considering the term regardless of the other variables. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients of terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, which would involve multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion and summing their coefficients. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}ab^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}b^4\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficient from the first expansion and the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " The binomial coefficients for \\(n = 4\\) are 1, 4, 6, 4, 1. So, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion is 6. Okay, so that's the first part. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I need to consider the expansion of that as well. But wait, since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to consider all the terms from the second expansion. Instead, perhaps I can think of it as multiplying the entire expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can just take the coefficient from the first part and multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply. Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. Actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) expanded as \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expanded as some terms involving \\(c\\), then when I multiply them together, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can ignore the terms in the second expansion that don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts. Wait, but the second expansion only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so it doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. That means that when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts only come from the first expansion, and the \\(c\\) parts come from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the second expansion isn't being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\); rather, each term in the second expansion is being multiplied by each term in the first expansion. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be the coefficient from the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion. Wait, that can't be, because the second expansion has multiple terms, and each term is multiplied by the first expansion's terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term in the second expansion is a constant (with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. So, I need to find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). How do I find the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial? Well, the sum of the coefficients is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by the entire second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which isn't a constant. Hmm, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). So, I must have made a mistake in my reasoning. Let me try a different approach. Let's consider the entire expression: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms in \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) don't interfere with each other. So, when we multiply them, the terms in the product will be the products of the corresponding terms from each expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But again, that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is not a number. So, I must have misunderstood the problem. Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would depend on \\(c\\). So, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply them together. That makes more sense. So, first, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that. Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is the product of the two coefficients, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me double-check that. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so their product contributes to the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\).

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that right? Let me think.\n\nActually, when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply together to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't affect the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient, and the variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't interfere with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) remains the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me verify.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so when you expand this, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, for example, the term \\(a^4\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^4c^6\\), \\(a^4c^4\\), etc. Similarly, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression isn't just 6; it's actually 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right either because each term from the second expansion has its own coefficient, and when you multiply by 6, you're scaling each of those coefficients. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), we need to consider that for each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), it contributes a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), we can consider that each multiplication by a term from the second expansion adds a coefficient to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, scaled by the coefficients from the second expansion. Therefore, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, does that mean the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384? Wait, but that doesn't seem right because when you multiply by each term, you're not just adding the coefficients, you're scaling each term individually. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), contributes a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\), and the coefficients add up. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we can sum all the contributions from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in any expression is found by substituting the variable with 1. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1/1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that logic. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then in the product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes from multiplying \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Each of those terms has a coefficient, say, \\(C_k\\), and when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), they contribute \\(6C_k a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we can sum all these contributions. Therefore, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{k} C_k\\), where \\(C_k\\) are the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of \\(C_k\\) is indeed 64, as calculated by setting \\(c = 1\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. However, in this case, since the variables are different, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is simply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial, when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), adds a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and some \\(c\\) term, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) term, we have to sum all these contributions. So, yes, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to expand the entire expression, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would come from multiplying \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so each of those terms would have a coefficient, and when multiplied by 6, they would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the total coefficient is indeed 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. Let me consider a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion of the first part is \\(a + b\\), and the second part is \\(c + 1/c\\). The product is \\(a(c + 1/c) + b(c + 1/c) = ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 1 + 1 = 2, so the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) is also 2. That makes sense because when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is scaled by the entire second polynomial. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is indeed 2, which is 1 (from the first polynomial) times 2 (the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial). So, applying the same logic here, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check another example to be sure. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion of the first part is \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and the second part is \\(c + 1/c\\). The product is \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 1 (from \\(a^2c\\)) plus 1 (from \\(a^2/c\\)), so total 2, which is 1 times 2 (sum of coefficients in the second polynomial). Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 2 (from \\(2abc\\)) plus 2 (from \\(2ab/c\\)), which is 4, which is 2 times 2. The coefficient of \\(b^2\\) is 1 times 2, which is 2. So, in each case, the coefficient in the product is the coefficient from the first polynomial times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial. Therefore, this seems to hold.\n\nTherefore, applying this to our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not confusing the sum of coefficients with something else. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is when we set \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), which is correct. So, yes, the sum is 64, and multiplying by 6 gives 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the entire expression being a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the product of the coefficients from each part. But in this case, since the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second part. But that seems contradictory to what I thought earlier.\n\nWait, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients from each polynomial whose variables multiply to give that term. But in this case, since the variables \\(a, b\\) and \\(c, 1/c\\) are separate, the terms in the product will have variables like \\(a^kb^l c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^l c^{-m}\\), but the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product will come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial by each term from the second polynomial. Each such multiplication will give a term like \\(a^2b^2c^m\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-m}\\), each with their own coefficients. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of the coefficients of all such terms. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we can sum all the contributions from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n$\\boxed{384}$"

But wait, the original problem isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by another expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire product.\n\nNow, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when I multiply, the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will only affect the coefficient if they multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, actually, no. Let me think again.\n\nWait, actually, no. Because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means that any term from the second expansion that has a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) will result in a term that includes \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, only the terms in the second expansion that have \\(c^0\\) (i.e., the constant term) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because multiplying by \\(c^0\\) doesn't change the power of \\(c\\). All other terms will introduce a \\(c\\) term, which we don't want because we're looking for a term with only \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero for the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\):\n\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies 2k = 6 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20 \\times 1 = 20\n\\]\n\nSo, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original expression. The term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by 20 from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), giving:\n\n\\[\n6a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 120a^2b^2\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the key idea is that when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. Since we're looking for a term that only has \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way that can happen is if we multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion by the constant term from the second expansion. Any other term from the second expansion would introduce a \\(c\\) term, which would make the resulting term have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which we don't want. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nLet me also check the binomial coefficients again to make sure I didn't miscalculate. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. So, that seems correct.\n\nI think that's the right approach. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by considering the expansion of each part separately. Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"
