    "text": " \n\nLet me write out the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, each term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. So, the terms would be:\n\n- When \\(k = 0\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 = 1 \\cdot a^4 = a^4\\)\n- When \\(k = 1\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 = 4a^3b\\)\n- When \\(k = 2\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\)\n- When \\(k = 3\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 = 4ab^3\\)\n- When \\(k = 4\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4 = 1 \\cdot b^4 = b^4\\)\n\nSo, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in this expansion is 6. But wait, the problem is actually the product of two expressions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I can't just take the coefficient from the first part because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. \n\nBut hold on, the question is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I'm looking for the term where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\), but since the second part of the product is in terms of \\(c\\), which is separate, maybe \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with \\(c\\). So, perhaps the \\(c\\) terms won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Let me think about that.\n\nIn other words, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion will just be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself, without any \\(c\\) terms, would only come from the case where the second part is multiplied by 1, right?\n\nWait, no. Actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients combine. But in this case, the variables are different, so the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiply it by the constant term (if any) from the second polynomial. But \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't have a constant term unless the exponent on \\(c\\) is zero. Let me check that.\n\nSo, let me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem as well. Each term will be \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k - k} = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponents on \\(c\\) will be \\(6 - 2k\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 6. Let me list the terms:\n\n- \\(k = 0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1 \\cdot c^6\\)\n- \\(k = 1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^4 = 6c^4\\)\n- \\(k = 2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^2 = 15c^2\\)\n- \\(k = 3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20 \\cdot 1 = 20\\)\n- \\(k = 4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(k = 5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(k = 6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\). Now, I can see that the constant term (the term without \\(c\\)) is 20 when \\(k = 3\\). So, when I multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, but the only term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 (from the first expansion) multiplied by 20 (from the second expansion's constant term). \n\nWait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2. When I multiply this by each term in the second expansion, the only term that will result in a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\) (without any \\(c\\) terms) is when I multiply by the constant term 20. Because if I multiply by any other term, like \\(c^6\\) or \\(c^{-6}\\), I'll get \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\), which are different terms. So, the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 multiplied by 20, which gives 120a\u00b2b\u00b2. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Is there any other way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) without involving \\(c\\)? I don't think so because the other terms in the second expansion all have some power of \\(c\\), either positive or negative. So, unless I'm missing something, the only contribution is from the constant term. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But since I'm only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), I need to multiply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20. So, that gives 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nLet me also think about it another way. If I were to write out the entire product, it would be the sum over all possible combinations of terms from each expansion. So, each term would look like \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\cdot \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, for a term to have \\(a^2b^2\\), we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, when \\(k = 2\\), the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, for the second part, we need the exponent on \\(c\\) to be 0, which happens when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient from the second part when \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the combined coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by expanding each part separately and then identifying the relevant terms. \n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem, which gives the term \\(6a^2b^2\\). Next, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the constant term, which is 20. Multiplying these coefficients together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to look at the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion and see what happens when it's multiplied by the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but actually, when I multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I only need to consider the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part because the other terms will result in higher powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) when multiplied by anything. So, the other terms in the first expansion (like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\)) when multiplied by the second part will give terms that have \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), etc., which are not \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the \\(6a^2b^2\\) term will contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the final product. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 times the coefficient of \\(1\\) (i.e., the constant term) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, only the term that doesn't change the power of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) (i.e., the constant term) will contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). The other terms in the second expansion will introduce \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which will affect the powers of \\(c\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms don't matter as long as they're multiplied by 1.\n\nWait, no, actually, when we multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term will be of the form \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms will just tag along, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), will result in a term like \\(6a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(6a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion multiplied by 6. Wait, no, that's not quite right because each term in the second expansion is separate, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is actually 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, no, that's not correct either because each term in the second expansion is separate, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that seems too large. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients add up when the variables match. But in this case, since the second expression is in terms of \\(c\\), and the first is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the variables are different. So, actually, the entire product will have terms like \\(a^kb^m c^n\\) or \\(a^kb^m c^{-n}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is simply 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will be multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), because that makes each term equal to its coefficient. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, no, actually, I think I made a mistake here. Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term is \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of each term in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), gives a term like \\(6a^2b^2 c^k\\) or \\(6a^2b^2 c^{-k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of each term in the second expansion. But the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64, as I calculated before by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient would be 384. But wait, that seems correct, but let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach this differently. Let me consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and when it's multiplied by the second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, yes, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Let me try another approach. Let me think about how the product works. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, the variables in the two polynomials are different: one is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other is in \\(c\\). So, the variables don't interfere with each other. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is simply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, each term is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), so when you collect like terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Therefore, as I calculated before, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me verify this with a small example to make sure I'm not making a mistake. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion would be \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 1 + 1 = 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would be 2. Let me check: expanding \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), we get \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is indeed 1*(1 + 1) = 2, and the same for \\(b\\). So, this seems to work.\n\nSimilarly, if I take \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be 1*(1 + 1) = 2, and the coefficient of \\(a^1b^1\\) would be 2*(1 + 1) = 4. Let's check: \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). Multiply by \\(c + 1/c\\), we get \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 1*(1 + 1) = 2, and the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 2*(1 + 1) = 4. That matches. So, my approach seems correct.\n\nTherefore, applying this to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\( (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) another way. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for each term. The sum of the coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so it's indeed \\(\\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there another way this could be approached? Maybe by considering generating functions or multinomial coefficients, but I think the approach I took is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a product of two independent polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, since the variables are independent. So, that would again give 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm not overcomplicating things. The problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^mc^n\\) or \\(a^kb^mc^{-n}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum over all \\(n\\) of the coefficients from the first polynomial times the coefficients from the second polynomial that contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). But since the first polynomial's term contributing to \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the second polynomial's terms contribute their coefficients multiplied by 6, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the other polynomial. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the entire expression as a product of two polynomials, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is simply the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) manually. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for each \\(k\\). So, the coefficients are:\n\n- \\(k=0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0} = 1\\), term \\(c^6\\)\n- \\(k=1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1} = 6\\), term \\(c^4\\)\n- \\(k=2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2} = 15\\), term \\(c^2\\)\n- \\(k=3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), term \\(c^0 = 1\\)\n- \\(k=4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4} = 15\\), term \\(c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(k=5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5} = 6\\), term \\(c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(k=6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6} = 1\\), term \\(c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the coefficients are 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1. Adding these up: 1 + 6 = 7, 7 + 15 = 22, 22 + 20 = 42, 42 + 15 = 57, 57 + 6 = 63, 63 + 1 = 64. So, the sum is indeed 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me just think if there's any possibility that I'm missing something. For example, could the term \\(a^2b^2\\) be affected by other terms in the first expansion when multiplied by terms in the second expansion? But no, because the only term in the first expansion that has \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6a^2b^2, and when you multiply it by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like 6a^2b^2c^6, 6a^2b^2c^4, etc., but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the sum of all these contributions, which is 6*(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6*64 = 384.\n\nSo, I think that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2 b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\n3. **Find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\):**\n   The coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part.\n\nSo, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\cdot c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when I multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, giving a total coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think that makes sense. Since the \\(c\\) terms are independent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the only way the \\(a^2b^2\\) term survives is if it's multiplied by the constant term (with respect to \\(c\\)) in the second expression. So, yes, 120 should be the correct coefficient.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the expansion of each part separately and then combining the relevant coefficients. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   - The term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   - The term independent of \\(c\\) (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0.

Using the binomial theorem, it would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Calculating the coefficients, that would be \\(1 \\cdot a^4 + 4 \\cdot a^3b + 6 \\cdot a^2b^2 + 4 \\cdot ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider both parts together. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but since the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), I need to see if that affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nLet me think. When we multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means we don't need to consider how \\(a^2b^2\\) interacts with the \\(c\\) terms, right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by terms involving \\(c\\), the resulting terms will have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, that seems a bit confusing because if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by something involving \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will still be there, but it will be multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part, because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you're essentially scaling the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by that entire expression. \n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would only come from the constant term in the second expansion, right? Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term with \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), you won't get a pure \\(a^2b^2\\) term unless \\(k = 0\\). \n\nWait, so actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nLet me check that. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanding, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nSo, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\) gives \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\). Now, if we want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to find all terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, we need to find \\(k\\) such that \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, multiplying these together, we get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the constant term in the second expansion because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) term, which would make it \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the constant term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. \n\nLet me also consider another approach to verify. Alternatively, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps we can treat the entire expression as a product and find the coefficient by considering the relevant terms. \n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) as before, which gives \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). Then, expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The expansion would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nNow, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nNow, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider all the terms in the product that result in \\(a^2b^2\\). But since the second expansion only affects the \\(c\\) terms, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself will be the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion that result in \\(c^0\\), because any other power of \\(c\\) would change the term to something like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. As we found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nLet me just double-check that the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed 20. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). We set the exponent equal to zero: \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Then, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), which is correct. \n\nAlternatively, if I were to compute the entire product, but that would be more complicated because we'd have to consider all the cross terms. But since the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's sufficient to find the coefficient in the first part and multiply it by the constant term in the second part. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nI think that makes sense. Let me see if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using generating functions or considering the product more abstractly, but I think the method I used is solid. \n\nAnother way to think about it is that since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can treat the entire expression as the product of two polynomials and focus only on the terms that contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). Since the second polynomial only affects the \\(c\\) terms, and we're not concerned with \\(c\\), the only contribution to \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term of the second polynomial. \n\nSo, yes, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The second factor \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) contributes a constant term when \\(k = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to consider the entire expansion. Let me think.\n\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), specifically the term \\(6a^2b^2\\). Now, when I multiply this term by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to see how that affects the coefficient. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), when I multiply it by each term in the second expansion, each term will be of the form \\(6a^2b^2 \\cdot \\text{something}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, is that right? Let me make sure. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will multiply each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But actually, no, that's not quite accurate. Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), but when we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we're actually considering the entire product, which would include \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion. However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion would just be the value when \\(c = 1\\). Let me check that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach this differently. Let's first expand both parts separately and then see how the terms combine. So, we have:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) as I did before, giving terms up to \\(a^4\\) and \\(b^4\\).\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem as well.\n\nSo, let's do that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is:\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nSimplifying the exponents, that's:\n\\[\nc^6 + 6c^{4} + 15c^{2} + 20c^{0} + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\n\\]\nSo, the coefficients for each power of \\(c\\) are 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1 for \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\).\n\nNow, going back to the original product: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we multiply these two expansions together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without any \\(c\\) terms. So, how can we have a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms? That would mean that in the product, the \\(c\\) terms must cancel out. So, we need to find all the terms in the product where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because \\(c^0 = 1\\), so that term will just be a constant (without any \\(c\\)), allowing it to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) and give a term with \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, to clarify, we need to find all the terms in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that have \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term, and then multiply that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\).\n\nLooking back at the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let's find that. The general term is \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\), so setting \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). So, the term when \\(k = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the constant term in the second part. So, that's \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, when we multiply these two, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by 20 from the second part, resulting in \\(120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 120. That makes sense because when you multiply the two expansions, only the constant term in the second expansion will contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product, since any other term would introduce a power of \\(c\\) which isn't present in the desired term.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the entire expansion and see if there are other contributions. But no, because any term with a non-zero power of \\(c\\) would result in a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), where \\(k\\) is non-zero, which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the constant term in the second expansion will contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in the second part), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to be sure. So, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is correct? Let's see:\n\n- When \\(k=0\\), term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1c^6\\)\n- \\(k=1\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^{4} = 6c^4\\)\n- \\(k=2\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^{2} = 15c^2\\)\n- \\(k=3\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\)\n- \\(k=4\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(k=5\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(k=6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nYes, that looks correct. So, the constant term is indeed 20. And the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is 6, so 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right.\n\nI think I've got it. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero).

Then, when I multiply this by the entire second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. \n\nBut since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second expansion only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), I think that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be \\(6\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, no, that can't be right because the problem is asking for a specific term, not the entire expansion. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" \n\nOh, wait, maybe the problem is considering all variables together, so \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term, but the entire expression also has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That is, the coefficient would be \\(6\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since each term in that expansion is multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is actually \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that doesn't make much sense because the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) are specific to each power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently.\n\nWhen you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. In this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), because the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Therefore, when you multiply the two expressions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expression. But wait, that doesn't seem right because the second expression is also a polynomial in \\(c\\), so the coefficient would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that's not a single number. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering the \\(c\\) terms. But that's not standard. Typically, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term in a product of expressions, you're considering the entire expression, including all variables. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Hmm, that's confusing.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, we're treating \\(c\\) as an independent variable, and we're looking for all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems like it's not a single coefficient, but rather a polynomial in \\(c\\). \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems a bit odd. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that the entire expression is a product, and when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a single number. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not a single number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is irrelevant because it's multiplied by other terms. But that seems unlikely because the problem specifically includes the second part. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, meaning that we need to consider the product of the two expansions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from the first part, and it would be multiplied by every term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is typically a number. So, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is just part of the expression. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to realize that since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the second part, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\), but the coefficient would still be 6 times whatever the coefficient is in the second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient in the product would be 6 times the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm making this too complicated. Let me think again. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by each term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut that seems odd because the coefficient is supposed to be a number, but in this case, it's a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, then that term would be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) to give a term that only has \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, that makes sense. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all variables. So, to get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if we multiply by any other term, like \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), which aren't just \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, that means I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by 6 to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. \n\nAlright, so let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set the exponent equal to zero:\n\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies 2k = 6 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\):\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{6 - 2(3)} = \\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nSo, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), which is:\n\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when we multiply these together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, giving a coefficient of 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if we didn't consider the constant term, and just took 6 times the entire expansion, that would be incorrect because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term without any \\(c\\) terms. So, yes, 120 should be the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we first determine the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Next, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives the coefficient as 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " \n\nLet me write down the expansion for \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial coefficients, which are 1, 4, 6, 4, 1 for the 4th power. So, expanding it:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nOkay, so the expansion has terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\). Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Looking at the expansion, I can see that the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is the third term, which is \\(6a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient here is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider both parts. Since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I might not need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) because they won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Let me think about that.\n\nWhen I multiply two expressions, the terms combine by multiplying each term from the first expression with each term from the second expression. But since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), any term that comes from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will just be a constant multiplier for the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since I'm only interested in the coefficient, maybe I can just take the coefficient from the first part and multiply it by the sum of the coefficients from the second part? Wait, no, that might not be correct because each term in the second expansion will have different powers of \\(c\\), but they are all multiplied together. \n\nWait, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients of the resulting terms are products of the coefficients from each polynomial. But in this case, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are separate from the \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms, so when you multiply them, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), maybe I can just consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the expansion of the second part includes terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but since we're only asked about \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then perhaps the coefficient is just the coefficient from the first part times the entire sum of the coefficients from the second part. Wait, no, that's not right because each term in the second expansion will contribute a different coefficient when multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are different variables, the terms in the expansion will involve products like \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{6 - m}\\), depending on how the second expansion goes. But since we're only asked about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then perhaps all we need is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would give us a term that includes \\(c\\) terms, but the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) part. Hmm, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps I need to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term from the second expansion, so the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nWait, but that's not correct because each term in the second expansion has different coefficients. Let me think differently. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial will be multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nWait, but that's not quite right because the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in the second part would be obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me check that again. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\), which is the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. So, when I multiply the first expansion by 64, each coefficient in the first expansion gets multiplied by 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nBut wait, is that correct? Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient would be \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is indeed \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient would be \\(6\\) times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nWait, but let me approach it another way to confirm. Let's expand both parts separately and then find the coefficient. \n\nFirst, as before, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(6a^2b^2\\). \n\nNow, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be written as:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). \n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but the coefficients in the second expansion are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\), so the sum of the coefficients is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\), as I thought earlier. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me make sure. Suppose I have \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when I distribute, I get \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\), which is equal to \\(6 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nTherefore, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6\\) times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion, which is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nAlternatively, if I were to write the entire product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, giving 384. \n\nWait, but let me check if this makes sense. Suppose I set \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), \\(c = 1\\), then the entire expression becomes \\((1 + 1)^4 \\times (1 + 1)^6 = 16 \\times 64 = 1024\\). On the other hand, if I set \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), \\(c = 1\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 384, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would contribute 384 to the total sum. But the total sum when \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), \\(c = 1\\) is 1024, which is the sum of all coefficients. So, 384 is just one part of that total sum, which seems reasonable because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384, and the total is 1024, which is consistent because 384 is less than 1024. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe by considering the entire expansion and looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nWait, but let me think about the problem again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present only in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which has different powers of \\(c\\). However, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, it's asking for the sum of all coefficients that come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part (which is 64), giving 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). The product P(a, b) * Q(c) would have terms where each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, the coefficient of a specific term in P, say \\(a^2b^2\\), would be multiplied by every term in Q. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is 6, and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, so the coefficient in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if I were to write the entire product, it would be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\left(\\sum_{i=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{i} a^{4 - i}b^i\\right) \\times \\left(\\sum_{j=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{j} c^{6 - j} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^j\\right)\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the second sum:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{j=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{j} c^{6 - 2j}\n\\]\n\nSo, when we multiply these two sums, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first sum and the sum of all coefficients in the second sum. \n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first sum is when \\(i = 2\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). \n\nThe sum of all coefficients in the second sum is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me consider a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion would be \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(ab\\) in this case would be zero because there are no \\(ab\\) terms. But if I were to ask for the coefficient of \\(a\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it would be the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first part times the sum of coefficients in the second part. The coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first part is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 2, which is correct because the terms are \\(ac\\) and \\(a/c\\), both with coefficient 1, so total coefficient for \\(a\\) is 2. Similarly, the coefficient for \\(b\\) would be 2. \n\nWait, but in this case, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term, but in the product, it's multiplied by all terms in the second expansion. So, the coefficient would indeed be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients from the second part. \n\nTherefore, I think my initial reasoning is correct, and the coefficient is 384. \n\nWait, but let me check once more. Let's compute the entire product up to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. \n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). \n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\). \n\nSo, when we multiply these two, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times (1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1)\\). \n\nWait, let me compute that sum: \\(1 + 6 = 7\\), \\(7 + 15 = 22\\), \\(22 + 20 = 42\\), \\(42 + 15 = 57\\), \\(57 + 6 = 63\\), \\(63 + 1 = 64\\). So, the sum is 64, as before. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{384}"

So, the terms will be:\n\n- When \\(k=0\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} a^4 b^0 = 1 \\times a^4 \\times 1 = a^4\\)\n- When \\(k=1\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} a^3 b^1 = 4 \\times a^3 b = 4a^3b\\)\n- When \\(k=2\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2 b^2 = 6 \\times a^2 b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\)\n- When \\(k=3\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} a^1 b^3 = 4 \\times a b^3 = 4ab^3\\)\n- When \\(k=4\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} a^0 b^4 = 1 \\times b^4 = b^4\\)\n\nSo, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). Okay, so I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. But wait, the original problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will depend on how this term interacts with the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, no, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it. So, when I multiply the two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to see how many times \\(a^2b^2\\) appears when multiplied by any term from the second expansion. \n\nWait, but actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the second part, when I multiply them together, the variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) won't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, because the second part doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. \n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will just be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) part remains, and the coefficients get multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, that seems a bit high, but let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering how the coefficients interact. Let me try another approach. \n\nLet me denote the first part as \\(P = (a + b)^4\\) and the second part as \\(Q = \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When I multiply P and Q, each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in P is 6a^2b^2, and when multiplied by each term in Q, which is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nSo, each term in Q is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k\\) from 0 to 6. Therefore, when I multiply 6a^2b^2 by each of these terms, I get terms like 6\\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2k}. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in Q, which is 6 times (sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for k from 0 to 6). \n\nBut the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for k from 0 to 6 is 2^6 = 64, as I thought earlier. So, 6 times 64 is indeed 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first part, and when multiplied by each term in the second part, it just adds up all the coefficients. So, yes, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P is 6, and since Q is multiplied by P, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in Q. So, yes, that's correct. \n\nWait, another way to think about it: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the other polynomial. So, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in P, and Q doesn't affect the a and b terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient in P times the sum of coefficients in Q. \n\nSo, yes, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nI think that's the correct answer. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we first expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\), giving a coefficient of 6.\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\).\n\nSince the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6 and it is multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, the coefficient in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

Using the binomial theorem, it would be:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\n\\]\nSimplifying the coefficients, that becomes:\n\\[\n1 \\cdot a^4 + 4 \\cdot a^3b + 6 \\cdot a^2b^2 + 4 \\cdot ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\n\\]\nSo, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is the third term, which has a coefficient of 6. So, from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider this part as well. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The term \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables. So, does that mean that when we multiply the two parts together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will just be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? \n\nWait, but actually, when we multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part is in terms of \\(c\\), I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the same as the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not quite right because when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will just carry through multiplied by the entire second expression. \n\nBut actually, I think I'm overcomplicating this. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what happens with \\(c\\). So, perhaps I just need to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), multiplied by the entire sum from the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the entire expression would have terms with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient should be a constant, not an expression in \\(c\\).\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, the entire expression is a product of two binomial expansions. When you multiply them, each term from the first expansion gets multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and when multiplied by each term in the second expansion, it becomes \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\text{(terms in c)}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that all the terms in the product that have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) would contribute to the coefficient. Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient is actually a sum of coefficients from the second expansion, each multiplied by 6. \n\nWait, no. Let me think again. When you have two expressions multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms in each expression that combine to form that specific term. But in this case, the specific term is \\(a^2b^2\\), which only comes from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, but the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is just multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^k\\) for various exponents \\(k\\). \n\nBut the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by all the terms in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that gets multiplied by 6, and when you collect all the terms with \\(a^2b^2\\), you'd have \\(6a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. \n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\)? But that seems too straightforward. Let me check that again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms, but since \\(c\\) is separate, the coefficient would just be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but that's not quite right because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times each term in the second expansion, but when you consider the entire product, each term in the second expansion is multiplied by 6, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. So, if I compute the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), that's when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all terms in the other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the entire second polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would require considering all the terms in the second polynomial. But since the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\), and the first is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the product will have terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second polynomial, each multiplied by 6. \n\nWait, but that's not correct because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. So, if I compute the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), that's 64, as I thought earlier. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me verify this another way. Let's expand both parts separately and see how the multiplication works. \n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\) expands to:\n\\[\na^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\nAnd \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as:\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nSo, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). \n\nNow, when we multiply the two expansions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\cdot \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that gets multiplied by 6, and when you collect all the terms with \\(a^2b^2\\), you have \\(6 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). \n\nWait, but \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}\\) is equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\), as I thought earlier. So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nBut let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product equal to 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion? Or is it something else? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but it's not specified. The problem just says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so it might be considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me think differently. Suppose I don't consider the \\(c\\) terms and just focus on the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), because the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). But that can't be right because the second part is a separate factor, so when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since the second expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire second expansion. \n\nWait, but that's not a number; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which should be a number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a scalar. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think of it as a product of two polynomials. The first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\). When you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, but since they involve different variables, the terms don't interfere. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first polynomial, which is 6, multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps it's just 6. But that seems too simple, and I think I'm missing something. \n\nWait, no, that can't be right because the product would have terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, that's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut let me check this again. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1/1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product, but the product includes terms with \\(c\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 times the entire second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the 0 power. In that case, I would need to find the term in the second expansion where \\(c^0\\), which is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, that makes more sense. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term in \\(c\\). So, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again: it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut that seems too large. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion. But the problem is probably asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. \n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to clarify. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that each term in the product that has \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\) contributes to the coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut I'm not sure if that's correct because usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term, you're considering all possible combinations that result in that term, including different powers of other variables. But in this case, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the entire second expansion. \n\nWait, but that's not a number; it's a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(c\\) is not present. In that case, we need to find the term in the second expansion where \\(c^0\\), which is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, that makes more sense because the problem is likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all terms, but perhaps only the constant term in \\(c\\). So, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. \n\nLet me check this again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is 6a^2b^2. When multiplied by the second expansion, each term in the second expansion is multiplied by 6a^2b^2, resulting in terms like 6a^2b^2c^6, 6a^2b^2c^4, etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times each coefficient from the second expansion. But if we're only interested in the term where \\(c\\) is not present, i.e., \\(c^0\\), then we need to find the term in the second expansion where \\(c^0\\), which is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nBut the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem is stated as: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's not specifying any power of \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^0\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all these coefficients, which is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nBut the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but that seems to contradict my earlier thought. So, I'm confused now. Let me try to clarify. \n\nWhen you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that combine to form that term. In this case, the term we're interested in is \\(a^2b^2\\), but since the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nSince the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, as calculated earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, that would mean that the coefficient is a number, 384, which is correct because when you multiply the two polynomials, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 384, considering all the terms in the second polynomial. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would be 120, as calculated earlier. But since the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384. \n\nWait, but that seems too high. Let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion would be \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 times the entire second expansion, which is \\(c + 1/c\\), so the coefficient is \\(c + 1/c\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number. So, that can't be right. Therefore, my earlier reasoning must be wrong. \n\nWait, so perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be a specific term. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nBut in the example I just did, if I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^0\\), that would be 1 (from \\(a\\)) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 1 (since \\((c + 1/c)^1\\) has terms \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 0, actually). Wait, that's not right. \n\nWait, in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\), the expansion is \\(c + 1/c\\), so there is no \\(c^0\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^0\\) would be 0. But in our original problem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) does have a \\(c^0\\) term, which is when \\(k = 3\\), as I thought earlier. \n\nSo, going back, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). If it's asking for the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120, because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial, which doesn't make sense in this context. So, I'll go with 120 as the answer. \n\nBut to make sure, let me think again. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but in the example I did earlier, if I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), and I look for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\), it would be 1 times the entire second expansion, which is \\(c + 1/c\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is misworded, and it's actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be a number. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nWait, but let me check the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's only specifying \\(a^2b^2\\), not any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut that seems to contradict the earlier example, where the coefficient would be a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is expecting 384 as the answer. \n\nWait, let me think differently. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by each term in the other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is 6, and when multiplied by the second polynomial, it becomes 6 times each term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire second polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which should be a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nI think that's the correct approach. So, the coefficient is 384. \n\nWait, but to be absolutely sure, let me compute it step by step. \n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. \n\nThen, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nSo, the coefficients in this expansion are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). \n\nNow, when we multiply the two expansions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\cdot \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. \n\nThe sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break it down into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\).\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

So, expanding, it would be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nOkay, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider the entire product. But actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only comes from the first part, right? Because the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be 6 times whatever the coefficient is from the second part when considering the variables. But wait, no, because the second part is multiplied by the first part, so when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. But since the second expression doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the only term that affects the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is the constant term from the second expression, right? Or wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, no, actually, the second expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, will have terms involving \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and it gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. Wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the second expansion is a different power of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they become terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second part, because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, no, that's not right because the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has terms with coefficients, but the sum of those coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too high. Let me think again.\n\nWait, actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, the variables in the two parts are different: the first part has \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the second part has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply, the variables don't interfere with each other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But since the second expansion is a sum, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6\\) times each term in the second expansion, but since the second expansion is multiplied as a whole, it's more accurate to say that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is indeed 64, as I thought before, because substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by each term in the second part, but since the second part is multiplied as a whole, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the entire second expansion, which is 6 * \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times each term in the second expansion, which is not correct because each term in the second expansion is a separate term. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. It's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, that would mean we're looking for the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out, i.e., the constant term in the second expansion. Because if we have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), that would be the only term contributing to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part.\n\nLet me try that approach. So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find the constant term, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the constant term in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because if I'm looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, that's the only term that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives a term without \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nLet me double-check that. So, the first part gives \\(6a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives a constant term of 20, so when multiplied together, it's \\(6 * 20 a^2b^2 = 120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), \\(1/c^6\\). So, when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), each of these becomes \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(120a^2b^2\\), \\(90a^2b^2/c^2\\), \\(36a^2b^2/c^4\\), \\(6a^2b^2/c^6\\). So, the only term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) is \\(120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed 120.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"

So, I guess the next step is to figure out how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, but actually, when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply as well, right? Wait, no, not exactly. Because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't affect the exponents of \\(c\\).

Hmm, perhaps the problem is intended to treat \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the coefficients for the same variables, but since \\(c\\) is present, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider all possible terms, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). When you multiply them, the variables are independent. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would come from the product of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all possible terms, but since \\(c\\) is another variable, perhaps the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients from each part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the middle term, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), because when \\(k = 3\\), \\(c^{6 - 3} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^3 = c^0\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire product and just wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but that doesn't make much sense because \\(c\\) is another variable. So, perhaps the intended answer is 120. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, so in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when you multiply these two parts, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by 20 from the second part, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there a possibility that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's written as \\(a^2b^2\\)? Or maybe the problem is intended to have \\(c\\) terms cancel out, but I don't think so. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms and ignoring the \\(c\\) terms, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the product of the coefficients from each part, specifically the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that would be 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nLet me just verify the steps again. First, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).

    "text": " \n\nLet me write out the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, each term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. So, the terms would be:\n\n- When \\(k=0\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 = 1 \\cdot a^4\\)\n- When \\(k=1\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 = 4a^3b\\)\n- When \\(k=2\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\)\n- When \\(k=3\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 = 4ab^3\\)\n- When \\(k=4\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4 = 1 \\cdot b^4\\)\n\nSo, the expansion is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. But wait, the expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire product. \n\nI think I need to find the term where, when multiplied together, the variables \\(a^2b^2\\) are present. But since the other part of the expression involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't contain \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), maybe the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as the coefficient from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second. So, actually, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) a sum, not a single number. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). In other words, it's the coefficient when considering all possible terms from the product, but only focusing on the \\(a^2b^2\\) part, regardless of what happens with \\(c\\). So, maybe I need to consider how the terms interact.\n\nWait, but the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part (which is 6a^2b^2) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but it's possible that the terms involving \\(c\\) might not affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term because they are separate variables. So, maybe the coefficient is just 6, as in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part doesn't affect it. But that can't be right because the entire expression is a product, so each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, meaning the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, if I consider the entire product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would have a coefficient that's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, setting \\(c = 1\\), \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high, and I'm not sure if that's the intended answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) are present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a sum, not a single number. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), without considering the other part. But that would be 6, but that seems too straightforward, and the presence of the other part suggests that it's part of the problem.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is 6a^2b^2, and this is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nSo, each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 6. So, when I multiply 6a^2b^2 by each of these terms, I get 6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2k}. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to 6, which is 6 * 2^6 = 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but that seems correct. Because for each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by 6a^2b^2, it contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the total coefficient is 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second expansion), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me check that. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible exponents of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would make it a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the problem is only about the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, regardless of \\(c\\), so perhaps the coefficient is just 6, but that seems incorrect because the other part does contribute.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would include all possible terms, but since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in the first part, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, without considering \\(c\\), but that seems unlikely because the expression includes both parts.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think differently. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but considering all possible terms, so each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the \\(6a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion, multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this by considering a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, I get \\(a \\times c + a \\times (1/c) + b \\times c + b \\times (1/c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), and similarly for \\(b\\). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a sum, not a single number. So, in this problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, but that seems incorrect because the entire expression is a product, so each term is multiplied by each term in the other expansion.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's just the coefficient from the first part, as the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that can't be right because when you multiply, each term is multiplied by each term, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the other part is irrelevant because it doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when the entire expression is expanded, but considering that \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, so \\(c^0\\). That would make more sense because then the coefficient would be a single number. So, let me consider that possibility.\n\nIf the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then I need to find the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., \\(c^{6 - 2k} = c^0\\), which implies \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, in the second expansion, the term where \\(k=3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. But the problem statement just says \\(a^2b^2\\), without mentioning \\(c\\). So, maybe the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, but that seems incorrect because the entire expression includes the second part.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to consider the entire product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that would be a very large coefficient, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for.\n\nWait, let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, leading to 384.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120, as I calculated earlier. That seems more plausible because it's a specific coefficient, not a sum.\n\nWait, let me think again. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since the coefficient is a number, that would mean that the second part's coefficients sum up to 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), so 120. Because if it were asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it would probably specify, or the answer would be 6, which seems too simple given the presence of the second part.\n\nWait, but let me verify. Let's consider that when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, it's 6, but that seems too simple.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, meaning that \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be the sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms. So, that would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the other part is irrelevant because it doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). But that seems incorrect because the entire expression is a product, so each term is multiplied by each term in the other expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut to be thorough, let me compute the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, it's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for each term \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nNow, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, and when multiplied by each term in the second expansion, it becomes \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\) is \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible exponents of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum over all \\(k\\) of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\), which is 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) from \\(k=0\\) to 6. \n\nThe sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) from \\(k=0\\) to 6 is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384. Therefore, the answer is 384.\n\nBut let me check this with a smaller example to make sure. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, I get \\(a \\times c + a \\times 1/c + b \\times c + b \\times 1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), and the coefficient of \\(b\\) is also \\(c + 1/c\\). So, if I were to find the coefficient of \\(a\\), it's \\(c + 1/c\\), which is the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Similarly, in this problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, I think the answer is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem to expand each part separately and then consider the product.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the expansions:**\n   Each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

    "text": " \n\nSo, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}ab^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}b^4\\). Let me compute those coefficients. \n\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} = 1\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} = 1\\)\n\nSo, the expansion becomes \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). Okay, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6. But wait, the problem involves multiplying this by another expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how that multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but actually, when I multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find all the terms in the expansion where the product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) results in a term with \\(a^2b^2\\). But hold on, the second expression doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\); it's only in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the second expression doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. But since the second polynomial doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the only way to get an \\(a^2b^2\\) term is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiplying it by any term from the second polynomial. But since the second polynomial doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. Wait, but that can't be right because the second polynomial has terms in \\(c\\), so when you multiply, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) and \\(a^2b^2/c^6\\), etc. But the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply that we're looking for the coefficient when considering the entire expression, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\), perhaps the question is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, that seems a bit ambiguous. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems complicated. Wait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That is, collect all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, and sum their coefficients, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems a bit odd. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. That would make more sense. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term in the second expansion. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by 6, the coefficient from the first part. That seems plausible. Let me go with that interpretation. So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Then, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me find that. \n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me double-check. If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be 6 times each term in that expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right. The problem probably expects a numerical coefficient, so I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). Therefore, the answer is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, to make sure, perhaps I should think about the entire expansion. When you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the second expansion has a different power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), meaning that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. Therefore, I must have misinterpreted the question. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), but that would mean summing over all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). But that would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that's not right either because the sum of all coefficients in the second part is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too high, and I don't think that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., the constant term. So, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nTo confirm, let's think about how the multiplication works. Each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, for the term \\(6a^2b^2\\), it will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), \\(1/c^6\\). Therefore, the term \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\) has coefficient 6, \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\) has coefficient 36, \\(6a^2b^2c^2\\) has coefficient 90, \\(6a^2b^2\\) has coefficient 120, \\(6a^2b^2/c^2\\) has coefficient 90, \\(6a^2b^2/c^4\\) has coefficient 36, and \\(6a^2b^2/c^6\\) has coefficient 6. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it would be the sum of all these coefficients, which is 6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6 = let's see: 6+36=42, 42+90=132, 132+120=252, 252+90=342, 342+36=378, 378+6=384. So, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\) is 384. But that seems like a lot, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120, that seems more reasonable. \n\nGiven that the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying the power of \\(c\\), it's a bit ambiguous. However, in such contexts, it's often implied that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(c\\), i.e., the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, I think the intended answer is 120. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Okay, so that's straightforward. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient we're looking for is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, actually, no. I think I might be misunderstanding. \n\nWait, no, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, and it's being multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables. So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Or do I need to consider something else?\n\nWait, maybe I should think of it as the product of two polynomials. So, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which are terms involving powers of \\(c\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), when multiplied by terms in the second polynomial, it will just be \\(a^2b^2\\) times a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would contribute a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the original coefficient times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nWait, but actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, so the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient times the power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all terms would be the original coefficient times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but the problem statement doesn't specify, so I think it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but actually, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which are terms like \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have coefficients multiplied by each of these, but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the total coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second part multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. So, yes, that would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut wait, how do I find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check that. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is just multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion. But that can't be, because the expansion includes terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that would be the coefficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), but since the problem doesn't specify a particular power of \\(c\\), it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so that would mean the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part contributes its coefficient to the product term.\n\nSo, yes, the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Let me consider that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, each of these terms when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) gives a term like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in each of these, but with different powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\) would be the sum of all these coefficients, which is 6*(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6*64 = 384.\n\nWait, but actually, in the second polynomial, the coefficients are 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1 for \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, c^0, c^{-2}, c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\) respectively. So, the sum of these coefficients is indeed 64, as calculated before. So, multiplying that by 6 gives 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then the entire second part is a generating function where each term is multiplied by that coefficient. So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not confusing coefficients with terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all the coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by the coefficient from the first polynomial. So, yes, that would be 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but another thought: perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the other variables, so that's correct. So, I think the answer is 384.\n\nBut let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) gives me \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Then, the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded has terms with coefficients 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1 for powers of \\(c\\) from 6 down to -6. The sum of these coefficients is 64, as I calculated before. So, when I multiply the two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6*1=6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 6*6=36, and so on. Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\) is 6*(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the other variables, so that would be the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a specific power of \\(c\\), but since it's not specified, I think it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so 384 is the answer.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me think of it differently. Suppose I consider the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). Then, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would appear multiplied by each term from the second polynomial, which are powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all the coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by the coefficient from the first polynomial. So, that's 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nYes, I think that's correct. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe expansion is:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion is 6.\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in this expansion can be found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n\\[\n\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nThus, the coefficient is:\n\\[\n6 \\times 64 = 384\n\\]\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{384}\n\\]"

So, the terms will be:\n- When \\(k = 0\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 = 1 \\cdot a^4 \\cdot 1 = a^4\\)\n- When \\(k = 1\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 = 4a^3b\\)\n- When \\(k = 2\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\)\n- When \\(k = 3\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 = 4ab^3\\)\n- When \\(k = 4\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4 = 1 \\cdot b^4\\)\n\nSo, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). \n\nNow, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Looking at the expansion, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\), so its coefficient is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient. \n\nLet me think about this. The expression is a product of two polynomials: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply these two, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut the thing is, I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I don't need to expand the entire expression. Instead, I can consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and whatever it gets multiplied by in the second part. But wait, actually, when I multiply two polynomials, the variables multiply as well. So, if I'm looking for a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), that term must come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by some term from the second part that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term that has \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), it would result in a term like \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I'm looking for the constant term in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because that's the only term that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) will give me a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, now my task is to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, we have \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\cdot c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) and solve for \\(m\\). \n\n\\(6 - 2m = 0\\)  \n\\(2m = 6\\)  \n\\(m = 3\\)\n\nSo, the constant term occurs when \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. So, the constant term is 20. \n\nNow, going back to the original problem. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part has a coefficient of 6, and the constant term in the second part is 20. When we multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there any other term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that could contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term when multiplied by another term from \\((a + b)^4\\)? For example, could a term with \\(c^k\\) from the second part multiply a term with \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\) from the first part to give \\(a^2b^2\\)? But looking back, the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms. It's only in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the product will have variables from both parts. So, the only way to get a term that's purely \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by the constant term from the second part. \n\nTherefore, I think my initial conclusion is correct. The coefficient is 120. \n\nWait, but just to double-check, let me consider the entire expansion. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I expand both, the product will have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m \\times c^{6 - m}\\), but no, that's not right. Wait, actually, each term in the first expansion is \\(a^kb^{4 - k}\\), and each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when you multiply them, you get \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that the term must have exactly \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the term where \\(k = 2\\) in the first expansion, because that's the only term with \\(a^2b^2\\), and then multiplied by the term in the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, as before, the coefficient is 6 (from the first expansion) multiplied by 20 (from the second expansion), giving 120. \n\nI think that's solid. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) because this term will not affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term when multiplied. Using the binomial theorem, we expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero:\n\\[\n6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n\\]\nThe constant term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nMultiplying the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by the constant term from the second part gives:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nLet me write out the expansion for \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, each term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. So, the terms are:\n\n- When \\(k = 0\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} a^4 b^0 = 1 \\cdot a^4 = a^4\\)\n- When \\(k = 1\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} a^3 b^1 = 4 \\cdot a^3 b\\)\n- When \\(k = 2\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2 b^2 = 6 \\cdot a^2 b^2\\)\n- When \\(k = 3\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} a^1 b^3 = 4 \\cdot a b^3\\)\n- When \\(k = 4\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} a^0 b^4 = 1 \\cdot b^4\\)\n\nSo, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). \n\nNow, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is right there in the expansion as 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider how this multiplication affects the term \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nLet me think. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a part of the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the whole expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), right? But actually, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. \n\nWait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) contributes a coefficient that gets multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, no, that's not quite correct. Because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it will produce terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, actually, that term can only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would make the term not just \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term that has a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot c^{-k}\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the constant term in the second part, which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. \n\nSo, first, let me find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found as 6. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nTo find the constant term, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, we get \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). \n\nSo, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20 \\cdot 1 = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. \n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that would be 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20, as we found. So, when we multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part gets multiplied by each term in the second part, but only the constant term contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake, let me think again. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part, because when you multiply two terms, their coefficients multiply. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second polynomial. So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120 is correct. \n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as the product of two polynomials, and when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum over all possible products of coefficients from each polynomial that result in \\(a^2b^2\\). But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part by the constant term from the second part. So, that's 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to expand this second part as well and then multiply the two expansions together. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I only need to consider the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion, right? Because when I multiply it by the second expansion, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will come from multiplying \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since I'm only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), the other terms won't affect it. So, I can focus on that term.\n\nSo, first, let's handle \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nSimplifying, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponents of \\(c\\) will be 6, 4, 2, 0, -2, -4, -6 as \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 6.\n\nNow, when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in this expansion, each term will look like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms don't matter because they're part of a different variable. So, actually, when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by the entire expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be \\(6\\) times the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, right? Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times each \\(c\\) term would be \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but hold on, that might not be correct. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients combine in a specific way. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one polynomial and \\(c\\) is in another, the variables are separate. So, actually, when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each product will have terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times each of the coefficients from the second expansion, but since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's actually 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that can't be right because the second expansion has different powers of \\(c\\), so each term in the product will have a different power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that gets multiplied by 6.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes to a term in the product, but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to sum all the coefficients from the second expansion and then multiply by 6. So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times\\) (sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)).\n\nBut wait, the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, in this case, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\). Let me compute that.\n\nSo, substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we get:\n\\[\n\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n\\]\nSo, the sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since the first polynomial has \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second has \\(c\\), the variables are separate. So, when you multiply them, the cross terms will have products of the variables, but the coefficients will multiply. However, since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), we can consider that term as being multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficient is 6 multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since the variables are separate, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the entire expansion being the product of two polynomials, so each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. But since the variables are different, \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) is the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that, when multiplied by 6, becomes part of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me think about it differently. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = A\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = B\\). Then the product is \\(A \\times B\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) is 6. In \\(B\\), each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\), so the coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{0} = 1\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{1} = 6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{2} = 15\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{4} = 15\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{5} = 6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{6} = 1\\). So, the sum of these coefficients is indeed 1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64, as I found earlier.\n\nTherefore, when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(B\\), each term contributes to a term in the product with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the total coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(B\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that term. But in this case, since the variables are separate, any term in \\(A\\) multiplied by any term in \\(B\\) will give a term where the variables are separate. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\), because each term in \\(B\\) contributes a coefficient that, when multiplied by 6, adds to the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\).\n\nSo, I think 384 is the correct coefficient.\n\nWait, but let me check another approach. Maybe I can compute the entire expansion and see.\n\nWait, but that would be time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the product step by step.\n\nWait, but I think my initial approach is correct. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in each part, but that doesn't make sense because the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, the second part's expansion only affects the coefficients of \\(c\\), not \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, I think that's correct. So, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by taking the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is calculated by substituting \\(c = 1\\), yielding \\(2^6 = 64\\). Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{384}\n\\]"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so for \\((a + b)^4\\), using the binomial theorem, the expansion would be:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\n\\]\nSimplifying the binomial coefficients, that becomes:\n\\[\n1 \\cdot a^4 + 4 \\cdot a^3b + 6 \\cdot a^2b^2 + 4 \\cdot ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6. Okay, so that's the first part done. \n\nNow, the whole expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), right? So, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut hold on, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). That means I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is a constant term, because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a constant, it remains as part of the coefficient. If I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), then the resulting term would have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) in it, which isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nLet me work on that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded as:\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nI need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, I set the exponent equal to zero:\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0\n\\]\nSolving for \\(k\\), I get:\n\\[\n6 = 2k \\Rightarrow k = 3\n\\]\nSo, the constant term occurs when \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient for this term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. So, the constant term is 20. \n\nWait, let me double-check that. The exponent is \\(6 - 2k\\), so plugging \\(k = 3\\), we get \\(6 - 6 = 0\\), which is correct. The binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is indeed 20. Okay, so the constant term is 20. \n\nTherefore, when I multiply the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). \n\nCalculating that, 6 times 20 is 120. So, the coefficient should be 120. \n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, I correctly identified that I need the constant term in the second expansion because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nLet me also verify the binomial coefficients again. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6, that's correct. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is at \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. \n\nIs there a possibility that I need to consider other terms? Let me think. Since the problem is about \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term from the first expansion, and the second expansion is multiplied by it. So, only the constant term in the second expansion will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the final product. Any term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) would create a term like \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think I'm correct in only considering the constant term. \n\nJust to make sure, let me consider an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). Now, when I multiply these two, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But only the 20 will multiply it to give a term without \\(c\\), so 6 * 20 = 120a^2b^2. All other terms would have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so they don't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120. \n\nWait, just another thought: is the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)? So, when we expand both, we get a product of two polynomials. Each term in the product is a term from the first polynomial multiplied by a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial can only combine with the constant term in the second polynomial to give a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant. Any other term from the second polynomial would introduce \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), making it not just \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, yes, I think I did it right. The coefficient is 120. \n\nI think I'm done here. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero:\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\nThe coefficient for this term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem, each term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I need the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. That means \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), so \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). So, the coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that. \n\n\\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient. Wait, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire expression, which includes both parts multiplied together. So, does that mean I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of these two expansions? Or is it just in the first part? Hmm, let me think. \n\nI think it's in the entire product, so I need to consider that when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, actually, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is a term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. \n\nBut since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would mean we're looking for the term in the product where the \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) in the second expansion \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term involving \\(c\\), like \\(c^k\\), then the resulting term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to get a term that is only \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to multiply it by the constant term in the second expansion. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, we've already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me figure that out. \n\nAgain, I can use the binomial theorem for this. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). \n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. \n\nNow, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found. That is, 6 (from the first expansion) multiplied by 20 (from the second expansion). \n\nSo, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. \n\nWait a second, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 because \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(c^0\\) is when \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together, 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems right. \n\nI don't think I made any errors in the calculations. Let me just recap: \n\n1. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiply them together: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nSo, the coefficient is 120. I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, we consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\) in the expansion:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the term \\(c^0\\) corresponds to \\(m = 3\\) in the expansion:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nThe coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\n\\]\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, we multiply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

But wait, the problem isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think the next step is to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nLet me denote the first part as \\(A = (a + b)^4\\) and the second part as \\(B = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression is \\(A \\times B\\). Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(B\\) only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't contain \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(B\\). But wait, actually, when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply term by term. But since \\(A\\) has terms with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and \\(B\\) has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient remains the same as in \\(A\\), because when you multiply by \\(B\\), each term in \\(A\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(B\\), but since we're only interested in the terms that don't involve \\(c\\), which would be the constant term in \\(B\\), if any.\n\nWait, but \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a Laurent polynomial, so it's possible that the only term without \\(c\\) is the constant term. Let me check that. Let me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem as well.\n\nSo, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, each term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Now, we're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because we don't want any \\(c\\) in the final term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\).\n\nSo, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is when \\(k = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, when we multiply \\(A\\) by \\(B\\), the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) will be multiplied by the constant term 20 in \\(B\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(B\\) is 20. So, when you multiply the two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A \\times B\\) will be \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2 = 120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that when you multiply \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), each term in \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(B\\), but that doesn't make sense because \\(B\\) is a Laurent polynomial. Wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so only the constant term in \\(B\\) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that's why it's 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, let me think again. When you have \\(A \\times B\\), each term in \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(B\\). But since \\(B\\) is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which includes terms with positive and negative exponents of \\(c\\), but we're only interested in the terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) in it, and we're looking for a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\). So, the only contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from multiplying \\(6a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in \\(B\\), which is 20. So, yes, 6 times 20 is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check if I did that correctly. So, if I have \\(A = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\) and \\(B = \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then when I multiply \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), each term in \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(B\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find all the ways that multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term in \\(B\\) gives a term without \\(c\\). But the only term in \\(B\\) that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is the constant term, which is 20. So, that's the only term that contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(B\\) is 20, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\(A \\times B\\) is 6 times 20, which is 120. So, yes, that makes sense.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that I'm not missing any other terms. For example, could there be a term in \\(B\\) that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) gives a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) but without \\(c\\)? But no, because all other terms in \\(B\\) have some power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply them by \\(a^2b^2\\), you'd get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), where \\(k\\) is non-zero, which we don't want. So, only the constant term in \\(B\\) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nSo, to sum it up, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the constant term of \\(B\\). So, \\(B = \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). Setting \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\\). So, yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the entire expansion of \\(B\\) to check. Let's see:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 + \\dbinom{6}{1}c^4 + \\dbinom{6}{2}c^2 + \\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 + \\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} + \\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} + \\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6}\n\\]\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1 \\times c^6 = c^6\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^4 = 6 \\times c^4 = 6c^4\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^2 = 15 \\times c^2 = 15c^2\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20 \\times 1 = 20\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15 \\times c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6 \\times c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1 \\times c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the constant term is indeed 20. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, when I multiply \\(A\\) by \\(B\\), the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\), but only the 20 term contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\). So, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the terms that multiply to give that specific term. So, in this case, since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(A\\), and we're multiplying by \\(B\\), which has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in \\(B\\). So, yes, that's 20, so 6 times 20 is 120.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\n\nCalculating each term, we get:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion is 6.\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nWe need the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero).
