    "text": " Hmm, okay. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), the coefficients of the terms can be found using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem states that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^{k}\\). So, in this case, our expression is \\((a + b)^4\\), so \\(n = 4\\).\n\nI need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think about what that means. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be when the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. Since the exponents add up to 4 (because \\(2 + 2 = 4\\)), that's exactly the case when \\(k = 2\\) in the binomial expansion. So, the coefficient would be \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = \\frac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Got that part.\n\nNow, the problem is actually a product of two expressions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But wait, how does the second part affect this? Let me think.\n\nWhen you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term is only affected by the terms in the second expression that are constants, right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by 1 (the constant term) would keep it as \\(a^2b^2\\). If I multiplied it by \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), it would change the term, but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), we can ignore those.\n\nSo, now my task is to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me apply the binomial theorem again here. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, it becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m}\\), which is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\), that's \\(\\frac{6!}{3!3!} = \\frac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\frac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Since these two are multiplied together in the product, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) as 6, and the constant term from the other expression is 20. So, when you multiply them, it's 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanding this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will only be multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20, so indeed, the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. Let me just make sure I didn't miss anything. The key here is that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so we're only concerned with the part of the second expression that doesn't change the \\(c\\) exponent, which is the constant term. Therefore, the coefficient is the product of the two coefficients I found.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm confident that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nThe constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{3} = \\frac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from the two expansions:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Hmm, okay. Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that when you expand a binomial like \\((a + b)^n\\), each term is given by the binomial theorem, which states that the expansion is the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(n\\) of \\(\\binom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion will have terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). Wait, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, right?\n\nBut then, the problem isn't just about \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by another expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the product of these two expansions. But hold on, the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, that's interesting because in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), might not affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, is that true?\n\nLet me think. When you multiply two expressions together, every term from the first is multiplied by every term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which have powers of \\(c\\), the resulting terms will have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself, without any \\(c\\) terms, would only come from the case where we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by 1, right? But in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) is the middle term, which is \\(\\binom{6}{3}c^3 \\cdot \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^3 = \\binom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120?\n\nWait, let me make sure. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and then I multiply that by the constant term of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120. Is that correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of the two expansions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it just adds coefficients for different powers of \\(c\\). But since the question is only about \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), wait, no, actually, the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. But \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion. But \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term on its own, so when you multiply it by the entire second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, no, that can't be right because the second expansion has different powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would only be affected by the constant term in the second expansion because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) in it.\n\nWait, so maybe the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion by the constant term in the second expansion. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\) or \\(1/c^k\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), which are different terms. So, the only way to get a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply it by the constant term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 (from the first expansion) multiplied by 20 (the constant term in the second expansion), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But no, in the problem statement, it's written as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\", which would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term on its own, without any \\(c\\) terms. So, yes, that would only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would be incorrect because the problem specifically asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), implying that \\(c\\) is not involved in that term. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficients of the product are found by convolving the coefficients of the two polynomials. But in this case, since the first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the variables are different, so the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's just the coefficient in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part? Wait, no, that's not right because the second polynomial has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, you get different terms. But if you're only looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then you would have to sum over all the coefficients of the second polynomial because each term in the second polynomial would multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) to give a term with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only include the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, right? Because otherwise, it's a different term. So, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\) because we need to choose 3 \\(c\\) terms and 3 \\(1/c\\) terms, which gives \\(c^3 \\cdot (1/c)^3 = c^0\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me think about the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Each term is \\(\\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\), as I thought earlier.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the answer.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm interpreting the question correctly. The problem says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the entire expression is the product of the two expansions. So, when you multiply them, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only be the term where \\(k = 0\\), because otherwise, it's a different term involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that would be 120. But as it is, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think 120 is correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I expand both expressions fully. The first expansion has terms up to \\(a^4\\) and \\(b^4\\), and the second has terms up to \\(c^6\\) and \\(c^{-6}\\). When I multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present in the product, but only when multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all independent, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term in the second part. So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Hmm, okay, so I think I need to expand both parts and then find the coefficient for that specific term. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me consider the expression \\((a + b)^4\\). I know that when expanding a binomial like this, I can use the binomial theorem, which states that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^{k}\\). So, applying that here, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be of the form \\(\\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4.\n\nSince I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That means I need to find the value of \\(k\\) such that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me check: if \\(k = 2\\), then the exponent of \\(a\\) is \\(4 - 2 = 2\\) and the exponent of \\(b\\) is \\(2\\). Perfect, that's the term I want.\n\nSo, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = \\frac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, that part gives me 6 times \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nNow, moving on to the second part of the original expression: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to expand this as well, but wait, I'm trying to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) involve \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Hmm, does that mean the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will multiply each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\)? So, when I multiply the two expansions together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think we might be interested in the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because only the constant term will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) to give a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factors.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think again. The original problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the product will be of the form \\((a^k b^{4 - k}) \\times (c^m \\times \\text{something})\\). But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is just \\(a^2b^2\\), so when I multiply it by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I'm looking for the coefficient that comes from \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by 1 (since the term doesn't involve \\(c\\)). So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because that's the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try another approach. The entire expression is the product of two expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right because each term in the product would be a combination of terms from both expansions.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me clarify. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms from each polynomial that multiply together to give that specific term. But in this case, the specific term is \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, for the product to have a term \\(a^2b^2\\), the term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) must be a constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), because otherwise, the product would involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which wouldn't be present in \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to calculate both coefficients and then multiply them together.\n\nI already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on that.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\binom{6}{3} c^{0}\\), which is \\(\\binom{6}{3} \\times 1\\). Calculating \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\frac{6!}{3!3!} = \\frac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\frac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients: 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\n1. Expanded \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem and found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. That seems right because \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. Expanded \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and found that the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20 by solving \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) which gives \\(m = 3\\), and then calculating \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\). That also seems correct.\n\n3. Then, since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient in the product is the product of the two coefficients, so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms that multiply to give that term. In this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a scalar in the product, the coefficient would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only term from the second expansion that contributes is the constant term, which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure that I'm not missing something here. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand this product, each term will be a combination of terms from both expansions. For example, a term like \\(a^2b^2c^3\\) would come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^3\\), but that's not the term we're interested in. We're only interested in the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out to give a constant term. So, the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) is when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term from the second expansion.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I'm not overcomplicating this. Another way to think about it is that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, and when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. But no, that's not correct because the second polynomial's coefficients are attached to different powers of \\(c\\), so they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Therefore, the only way the \\(a^2b^2\\) term can exist in the product is if it's multiplied by a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), which is the constant term. Therefore, the coefficient is just 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to write out the entire product, it would be \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would result in a sum of terms where each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, but only the constant term would result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms would have some power of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so they wouldn't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nTherefore, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me try another approach. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I expand this, it's equivalent to \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times \\left(1/c\\right)^m\\).\n\nSimplifying the second sum, it's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when I multiply these two sums together, each term in the first sum is multiplied by each term in the second sum. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), which as before, gives \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNow, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, I need to multiply this 6 by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I considered multiple approaches and checked my work to ensure that I didn't make any mistakes. So, I'm confident that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\n   \\]\n   We need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which occurs when \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{6}{3} = \\frac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficients found in the two expansions:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLooking at the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me expand that. Using the binomial theorem, each term in the expansion will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. So, the expansion would be:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the binomial coefficients, that's:\n\n\\[\n1 \\cdot a^4 + 4 \\cdot a^3b + 6 \\cdot a^2b^2 + 4 \\cdot ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\n\\]\n\nOkay, so in this expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. But wait, the original problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider both expansions multiplied together.\n\nBut hold on, the question is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm. So, maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they are separate from the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Let me think.\n\nWhen you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) is being multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, their exponents don't interfere with each other. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire expression, which includes the \\(c\\) terms. So, does that mean that the coefficient could involve terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as well? Hmm, I'm a bit confused now.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), you're only considering the terms where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, regardless of what happens with the \\(c\\) terms. So, the \\(c\\) terms can be anything because they're separate variables. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would give multiple terms, and each of those would be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient would actually be the sum of all those terms multiplied by 6.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me clarify: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply term by term. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4 = A + B + C + D + E\\), where each letter represents a term with different powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and then I multiply it by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = F + G + H + ... \\), then each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\). Let me check that. If I substitute \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nBut wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me make sure I'm not missing something. Is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product equal to the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in each part? Wait, no, because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), effectively adding their coefficients to the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = P\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = Q\\). Then, the product \\(P \\times Q\\) will have terms like \\(a^4 \\times c^6\\), \\(a^4 \\times c^5 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c}\\), and so on, but the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are separate from the \\(c\\) terms. So, when you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), you're looking at all the terms in \\(P \\times Q\\) where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\), because each term in \\(Q\\) will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributing its own coefficient to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) is 6, as we found earlier, and the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\) is 64, as calculated by substituting \\(c = 1\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me check that again because I might be confusing something. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) times the entire expansion of \\(Q\\). But actually, when you multiply \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\), each term in \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\), because each term in \\(Q\\) will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), effectively adding their coefficients.\n\nBut wait, another way to think about it is that the product \\(P \\times Q\\) can be written as \\(\\sum_{k} \\text{(terms from P)} \\times \\sum_{m} \\text{(terms from Q)}\\). So, when you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), you're only considering the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\), because each term in \\(Q\\) is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nTherefore, I think my initial conclusion is correct: the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure by another approach. Let's consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) separately.\n\nFrom \\((a + b)^4\\), as we saw, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nFrom \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, the sum of all coefficients in this expansion would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\), as before.\n\nTherefore, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if this makes sense by considering a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\). So, multiplying them gives \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) here is zero because there are no \\(a^2b^2\\) terms. Wait, but according to my earlier method, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in \\((a + b)^2\\) is 1, and the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\) is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), so 1 times 2 would be 2, but in reality, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, so my earlier approach must be wrong because in this simpler case, it doesn't hold. So, where did I go wrong?\n\nAh, I think I see the mistake. The issue is that when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the variables are independent, so the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't affect the exponents of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term with no \\(c\\) in it, so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^5 \\times 1/c\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would require that the power of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the term where \\(c\\) cancels out.\n\nWait, that's a different approach. So, perhaps I misread the problem. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include any power of \\(c\\). But in reality, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without any \\(c\\) factors, so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^5 \\times 1/c\\), etc. But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would only come from \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, in fact, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nAh, that makes more sense. So, I was wrong earlier because I thought the entire sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is multiplied, but actually, only the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) would contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term without any \\(c\\) factors.\n\nSo, let me correct my approach. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nFirst, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To do this, we can expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Earlier, I thought it was 384, but that was because I mistakenly multiplied by the sum of all coefficients, which includes all powers of \\(c\\). But actually, only the term where \\(c\\) cancels out (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term without any \\(c\\) factors. So, the correct coefficient is 120.\n\nLet me verify this with a smaller example to ensure I'm not making a mistake. Let's take \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion of \\((a + b)^2\\) is \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and the expansion of \\((c + 1/c)^1\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\).\n\nMultiplying these together:\n\n\\[\n(a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c) = a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\n\\]\n\nNow, looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in this product, there are no terms with both \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) because each term in the first expansion has either \\(a^2\\), \\(ab\\), or \\(b^2\\), and when multiplied by \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), they remain as such. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero, which aligns with the fact that in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is zero because there is no constant term. Wait, that's not the case because \\((c + 1/c)^1\\) has \\(c^1\\) and \\(c^{-1}\\), so the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is zero. Therefore, when we multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't exist in the product, the coefficient remains zero, which is correct.\n\nAnother example: Let's take \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion is \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero, which is correct because there are no \\(a^2b^2\\) terms. But according to our method, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^1\\) is zero (since the highest power is \\(a^1\\)), so the product would be zero, which matches.\n\nWait, let's try another example where the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is non-zero. Let's take \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). The expansion of \\((c + 1/c)^2\\) is \\(c^2 + 2c \\times 1/c + (1/c)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 2.\n\nNow, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^2\\) is zero because \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be zero times 2, which is zero. But let's see the actual product:\n\n\\[\n(a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2) = a^2c^2 + 2a^2 + a^2/c^2 + 2abc^2 + 4ab + 2ab/c^2 + b^2c^2 + 2b^2 + b^2/c^2\n\\]\n\nLooking for \\(a^2b^2\\), there are no such terms because each term has either \\(a^2\\), \\(ab\\), or \\(b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient is indeed zero, which matches our method.\n\nWait, but let's try a case where the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is non-zero. Let's take \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\), which is our original problem. As we found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20, so the product is 120. Let me check if that makes sense.\n\nIf I consider the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) in the second part. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the answer was 384, but that was because I was considering all coefficients in the second expansion, which is incorrect because only the constant term contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term without any \\(c\\) factors. So, the correct coefficient is 120.\n\nTherefore, after correcting my mistake, I conclude that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"

That's another binomial expression, but this time with variables involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). \n\nI need to consider how multiplying these two expressions together affects the coefficients. Since the two expressions are multiplied, each term from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem specifically asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to find all the terms in the product where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\).\n\nWait, but actually, in the product, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, when multiplied by any term from the second part, it will result in a term like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{-k}\\), depending on the term in the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think that the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, because when you multiply by 1 (since any term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\)), it doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in terms of the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). \n\nWait, but that might not be entirely accurate. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients combine in a specific way. However, in this case, the first polynomial has terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all distinct variables, their exponents don't interfere with each other. So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, the resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But wait, no, that's not correct either because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by the corresponding term in the first expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me approach it differently. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is \\(6a^2b^2\\). Now, when I multiply this by the entire second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the result will be \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that's not right because each term in the second expansion is a monomial, and when you multiply by \\(6a^2b^2\\), each term becomes \\(6a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) or \\(6a^2b^2 \\times c^{-k}\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, we need to consider all the terms where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term independent of \\(c\\), but when multiplied by the second expansion, it's actually \\(a^2b^2\\) times a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That is, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) could be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient for each such term would be 6 times the coefficient from the second expansion. However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the power of \\(c\\), then it's actually the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives a term like \\(6a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) can be from -6 to 6. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nBut wait, that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times a specific power of \\(c\\), but the problem didn't specify. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". It just says \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term will have some combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives a term \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\), each with coefficient 6 times the respective coefficient from the second expansion. Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nBut wait, no, that's not correct. Because in the product, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first expansion, and when multiplied by any term from the second expansion, it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times something involving \\(c\\). Therefore, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), that is, the sum of all coefficients where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), then yes, that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it actually wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). In that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the product. That would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Let me check the problem again: it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". It doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), but in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would only appear if the second expansion has a term with \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion.\n\nThat seems more plausible. So, let's proceed with that approach.\n\nFirst, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That is, the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nTo find the constant term, we can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\).\n\nSolving for \\(k\\):\n\n\\(6 - 2k = 0\\)\n\n\\(2k = 6\\)\n\n\\(k = 3\\)\n\nSo, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\n\\]\n\nWait, that's not correct. Wait, 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\n\\]\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each expansion, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the problem might be asking for the sum of all coefficients, which would be 6 times 64, but now I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient where \\(c^0\\) is involved, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself, which would be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nLet me verify this again. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, each term is a combination of terms from both expansions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) in the second expansion. Because any other term in the second expansion would introduce a power of \\(c\\), making the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but if the problem is asking for just \\(a^2b^2\\), that would require \\(k = 0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm interpreting the problem correctly. If the problem had said \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^3\\)\", then it would be a different story. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), it's ambiguous whether they mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be the sum over all \\(k\\) of 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\), or whether they mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\). \n\nBut in the problem statement, it's written as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without any mention of \\(c\\). So, in the context of the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a term that's multiplied by \\(c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. But that would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 384. But that seems high, and I'm not sure if that's the intended interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\), then it's 120. \n\nWait, perhaps I should check both interpretations.\n\nFirst interpretation: Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). That is, the sum over all \\(k\\) of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). In this case, each term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) has coefficient 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all \\(k\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, 6 times 64 is 384.\n\nSecond interpretation: Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just the term \\(a^2b^2\\). In this case, it's 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, so 6 times 20 is 120.\n\nWhich interpretation is correct? I think it depends on how the problem is phrased. Since the problem is written as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying any power of \\(c\\), it's ambiguous. However, in the context of polynomial multiplication, when you have multiple variables, asking for the coefficient of a specific combination of variables without mentioning the others usually implies that you're considering the coefficient regardless of the other variables. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), but in the product, it's multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\), so each term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for all \\(k\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 384.\n\nBut wait, that doesn't make sense because in the product, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first expansion, and when multiplied by any term from the second expansion, it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times a term involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying \\(c\\), it's ambiguous, but in most cases, when variables are not specified, it's considered as the coefficient regardless of the other variables, which would be the sum over all possible coefficients for that combination. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that's being multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the same as the coefficient in the first expansion, because each term in the second expansion is a separate term. Wait, that doesn't make sense either.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from -6 to 6 in steps of 2 (since each term in the second expansion is \\(c^m\\) where \\(m = 6 - 2k\\) for \\(k\\) from 0 to 6). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the first expansion. However, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^m\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually the same as the coefficient in the first expansion, because each term in the second expansion is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself (without any \\(c\\) terms) would be zero because all the terms have \\(c\\) to some power. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself. \n\nBut then, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), that is, the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for all \\(k\\), then it would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut I think the intended interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, let me think again. If I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c), then the product P(a, b) * Q(c) would have terms where each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, the coefficient of a specific term in P, say \\(a^2b^2\\), when multiplied by Q(c), would be \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire Q(c). Therefore, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in Q. Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\), that would be zero because all terms have some power of \\(c\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for it, so perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be the sum over all k of (coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\)).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum over all k of (6 * coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in Q(c)). So, that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in Q(c), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut that seems counterintuitive because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\), so each of those would have their own coefficients. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's like treating \\(a^2b^2\\) as a single term, which would have a coefficient that's the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nI think I need to check both interpretations and see which one makes sense.\n\nFirst, let's assume the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is \\(a^2b^2\\). Then, as calculated earlier, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nSecond, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients where the term is \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\), then it's 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, let me think again. The problem is written as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". Since the expression involves both \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the first factor, when multiplied by the second factor, it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). Therefore, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself does not exist unless multiplied by \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), that would be 6. But since it's in the product with the other expansion, it's more about finding the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) part. But in the product, each term is \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\), so \\(a^2b^2\\) would only appear when \\(k = 2\\), which is in the first expansion, and multiplied by any term from the second expansion, which would have \\(c^m\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient in the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems to contradict the idea that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself doesn't exist in the product unless multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), which would be the sum over all \\(k\\) of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion, which is 6, and not considering the second expansion. But that can't be because the problem explicitly includes the second expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of it as two separate parts. The first part is \\((a + b)^4\\), which has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\). The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which has terms involving \\(c\\). When you multiply these two, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is not a single number but rather a collection of coefficients for each \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which is ambiguous. \n\nHowever, in most contexts, when asking for the coefficient of a term in a product of polynomials, especially when variables are involved, it's usually referring to the coefficient when considering all variables. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the first polynomial, and the second polynomial involves \\(c\\), perhaps the intended interpretation is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as in the first polynomial, which is 6, because the second polynomial doesn't affect the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, the coefficients do combine.\n\nWait, no, because the second polynomial is in a different variable, so when you multiply, the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are not affected by the coefficients of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as in the first polynomial, which is 6, because the second polynomial is just being multiplied as a whole. But that can't be right because the second polynomial has multiple terms, so when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by the entire second polynomial, which would affect the coefficients when considering the product. But in reality, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire second polynomial, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any \\(c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second polynomial. Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it's actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 times 20 = 120.\n\nWait, I'm going in circles here. Let me try to approach it from another angle.\n\nThe product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me denote the first part as P(a, b) = (a + b)^4 and the second part as Q(c) = (c + 1/c)^6.\n\nWhen you multiply P(a, b) and Q(c), you get a product where each term is a term from P multiplied by a term from Q. So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from P is multiplied by each term in Q, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) in the product is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in Q.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a bit ambiguous. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's the sum over all k of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in Q. The sum of coefficients in Q is found by setting c = 1, so Q(1) = (1 + 1)^6 = 64. Therefore, the sum would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\), then it's 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in Q, which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nGiven that the problem didn't specify any power of \\(c\\), I think the intended answer is 120, assuming that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). However, to be thorough, I should consider both interpretations.\n\nBut let me think about how the problem is phrased. It says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the first factor, and the second factor is in terms of \\(c\\), it's possible that the problem is considering the entire product and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut I'm still not entirely sure. Let me check both possibilities.\n\nIf the answer is 120, that's because we're considering \\(a^2b^2c^0\\).\n\nIf the answer is 384, that's because we're considering all terms \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\).\n\nGiven that the problem didn't specify any \\(c\\) power, I think the more reasonable interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nBut to be absolutely certain, let me think about how coefficients work in polynomial products. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients from each polynomial that combine to form that term. In this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the first polynomial, and it's multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which introduces the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually the same as in the first polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself (without any \\(c\\)) is zero. But that can't be right because the problem is asking for it, so perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 384.\n\nWait, but in reality, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is determined by the product of coefficients from each polynomial that combine to form that term. So, for the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's formed by \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and \\(c^0\\) from the second. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nIf the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), that is, the sum of all coefficients of terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut in standard polynomial terminology, when you ask for the coefficient of a specific term, you're usually referring to a specific combination of variables. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any \\(c\\), it's ambiguous, but in most cases, it's interpreted as the coefficient when all other variables are set to their lowest possible exponents, which in this case would be \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the answer is 120.\n\nBut to confirm, let me think of a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion would be \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) in this product would be the coefficient of \\(a c^1\\) and \\(a c^{-1}\\), which are 1 and 1, respectively. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 1 + 1 = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would be 1 + 1 = 2. Therefore, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is the sum of the coefficients from the second polynomial, which is 2. Similarly, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of the coefficients from the second polynomial, multiplied by 6, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, that makes sense"

    "text": " Hmm, okay, so I need to figure out the coefficient for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in that product. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem states that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^k\\). So, in this case, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would be the sum from k=0 to 4 of \\(\\binom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\). \n\nBut wait, in our problem, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the term where the exponents of a and b are both 2. That would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) in the binomial expansion because when k=2, the term is \\(\\binom{4}{2}a^{2}b^{2}\\). \n\nLet me compute that binomial coefficient first. \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as 4! / (2! * (4 - 2)!)) which is (24) / (2 * 2) = 24 / 4 = 6. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nOkay, so that's the first part. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm being asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but the second part of the product involves c terms. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables from \\(c\\), their exponents won't interfere with each other in the product. So, when I multiply out the two expansions, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will multiply with the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). \n\nBut wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that term would come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) with every possible term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that the coefficient will be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, because when you multiply by 1 (from the second part), it doesn't change the coefficient. Wait, no, that's not quite right.\n\nWait, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in c, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in that expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the c terms don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). Wait, that might not be correct.\n\nWait, actually, when you multiply the two expressions, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which would result in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various exponents k. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms. Wait, no, that can't be right because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and when you multiply by the second part, which includes terms with c, you end up with terms that have both a, b, and c. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only occur if the c terms multiply to 1, perhaps?\n\nWait, that seems confusing. Let me think again. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the term that's 1 in the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't have a constant term unless c^0 is present. Wait, does \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) have a constant term?\n\nLet me check. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponents of c in each term are 6 - 2m. To find the constant term, we need 6 - 2m = 0, so m = 3. Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, resulting in 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 120. \n\nWait, but is that correct? Because when you multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but only the constant term in the second expansion would contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is a different term, not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) remains as a standalone term is if it's multiplied by the constant term (i.e., where the exponent of c is zero). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed the product of the coefficients from each part. So, 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in the second part) gives 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Is there another term in the second expansion that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\)? For example, if the second expansion had a term with \\(c^0\\), which is 1, then that's the only term that would multiply with \\(a^2b^2\\) to give \\(a^2b^2\\). Any other term would have a c component, so the product would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where k is not zero, which wouldn't be the same as \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, yes, I think I'm correct. The coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of the entire expansion and how the terms combine. Let me write it out step by step.\n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\binom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\binom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\binom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\binom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\binom{4}{4}a^0b^4\n\\]\n\nCalculating the coefficients:\n\n- \\(\\binom{4}{0} = 1\\)\n- \\(\\binom{4}{1} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\)\n- \\(\\binom{4}{3} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\binom{4}{4} = 1\\)\n\nSo, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\na^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nNow, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand this using the binomial theorem as well:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term is \\(\\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The exponents of c will be:\n\n- For m=0: 6\n- m=1: 4\n- m=2: 2\n- m=3: 0\n- m=4: -2\n- m=5: -4\n- m=6: -6\n\nSo, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\nc^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20c^0 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\n\\]\n\nNow, when we multiply the two expansions together, each term in the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. We're interested in the terms where the product results in \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nBut wait, actually, in the product, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, so the variables will multiply as well. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider all products where the a and b exponents in the first part are 2 and 2, respectively, and the c exponents can be anything because they don't affect the a and b terms. Wait, no, that's not right because the c exponents will be part of the term. So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) with a term in the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\), because any other term would introduce a c component, making it \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms. Hmm, actually, no, that can't be. Because in the product, each term is a combination of a, b, and c. So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's the sum of all terms where the exponents of a and b are 2, regardless of the exponent of c. But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include any c terms. Wait, no, that's not possible because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first polynomial, and when multiplied by the second polynomial, it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second polynomial, which includes c terms. So, the only way to have a term that is exactly \\(a^2b^2\\) without any c terms is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term (c^0) in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part.\n\nSo, as calculated earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Suppose I consider the entire product:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4) \\times (c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6})\n\\]\n\nWhen I multiply these, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will multiply each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), etc. So, the only term that results in \\(a^2b^2\\) without any c terms is \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some k, that would be a different matter. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), it must be the case where the c terms cancel out, i.e., multiply by \\(c^0\\).\n\nWait, but hold on. Is that the correct interpretation? Because in the product, each term is a combination of a, b, and c. So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's possible that the term could have any power of c, but the problem is asking specifically for \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply that the exponent of c is zero. Otherwise, if it's \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some k, the coefficient would be different.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct approach is to consider only the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, resulting in a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Suppose I didn't consider the c terms and just multiplied the coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, so the combined coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of the two polynomials, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum over all possible products of coefficients from each part that result in \\(a^2b^2\\). But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first part and the second part doesn't have any a or b terms, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part with a term that is 1 (i.e., c^0) from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)** using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k=2\\), giving:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)** using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term (where \\(c^0\\)) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m=3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\binom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Multiply the coefficients** from each expansion to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Hmm, let's see. I think I can approach this problem by breaking it down into smaller parts. \n\nFirst, I remember that when expanding expressions like \\((a + b)^n\\), we can use the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^{k}\\). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nThe problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to find the term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. Let me write that out.\n\nSo, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the general term is \\(\\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\). I need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, substituting \\(k = 2\\), the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\), which is 4! / (2! * (4 - 2)!) = (24)/(2 * 2) = 24 / 4 = 6. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I think this part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so maybe I just need to consider the coefficient from this part separately and then multiply it by the 6 I found earlier.\n\nWait, no, actually, the entire expression is the product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't matter because we're only focusing on the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But that seems a bit off. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, actually, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials. So, when we multiply them, each term in the first polynomial will multiply each term in the second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can consider that term separately from the other terms involving \\(c\\).\n\nSo, in other words, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, when we're asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any term from the second expansion, but since the problem doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), I think we might be considering the entire coefficient, including all possible terms from the second expansion.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, maybe the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the entire second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient isn't just a number but a polynomial. But the problem asks for a coefficient, which is a number. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would involve multiplying the two expansions. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like it's not just a single coefficient. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any term in the second expansion, but without any specific power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would just be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But that also doesn't seem right because the sum of coefficients in the second expansion would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, so perhaps the problem is considering all terms, and we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.

But that would result in a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting just the numerical coefficient, ignoring the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me check this approach again. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, if we multiply this by 6, we get 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If we have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then when we expand, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which means that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient, not the entire term, perhaps it's considering the coefficient as a polynomial, which would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms, which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, times the entire second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. So, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the variables don't interfere. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. But since we're just looking for the coefficient, not the entire term, perhaps it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but let me verify this with a different approach. Let's consider that \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Since the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\( (1 + 1)^6 = 64 \\), so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider the problem as asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of each term in the second expansion. But since the problem doesn't specify a particular power of \\(c\\), I think the intended answer is 384.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm wrong. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's 6 times the entire expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually more straightforward. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), which gives 6\\(a^2b^2\\). Then, when we multiply this by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number, which contradicts the problem's wording.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. So, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and not considering the second part. But that seems unlikely because the entire expression is the product of both.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would involve considering all possible products of terms from both expansions that result in \\(a^2b^2\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and multiply it by any term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the entire product is a single polynomial, and we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, to confirm, let's consider a simpler example. Suppose we have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the product would be 1 (from \\((a + b)^2\\)) times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1)^1\\), which is 2, so the coefficient would be 2. Alternatively, if we consider the product, it's \\(a^2 \\times (c + 1)\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is \\(c + 1\\), which is a polynomial. But in the problem, the coefficient is a number, so perhaps the intended approach is to consider the sum of coefficients, which would be 2 in this case.\n\nTherefore, applying that logic, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest is part of the other variables, but that seems unlikely because the problem includes both \\(a, b, c, 1/c\\) in the expression.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try another approach. Let's consider the entire product as a product of two independent polynomials. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient, perhaps it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but maybe I should think in terms of generating functions. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, but that seems too simple, and the second part is there for a reason.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to write out the expansion.\n\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6\\(a^2b^2\\). Then, when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion will be multiplied by 6\\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would mean we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). In that case, we would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) from the second polynomial, then multiply them together.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, we would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, then multiply them.\n\nSo, let's do that.\n\nFirst, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as we found earlier.\n\nNext, from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. To find that, we can use the binomial theorem again.\n\nThe general term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\), which is 20.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\); it just asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nBut now I'm confused because the problem could be interpreted in two ways: either it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), which would be 384, or it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so perhaps it's considering all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nBut I'm still unsure because in the problem statement, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), so maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest is part of another variable's expansion. But that seems unlikely because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients would be multiplied.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nTherefore, I think the intended interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would involve considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which contradicts the problem's wording.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by \\(c\\) terms, which don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. But that seems incorrect because when you multiply by another polynomial, the coefficients do get scaled.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384.\n\nBut I'm still not entirely sure. Let me try to think differently. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire second polynomial. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, perhaps it's expecting the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, multiplied by 6, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nBut to confirm, let's consider an example. Suppose we have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product is 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 2, so 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would also be 2. But if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a \\times c^0\\), it would be 1 * 1 = 1, and similarly for \\(a \\times c^1\\), it's 1 * 1 = 1. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product is 2, which is the sum of coefficients in the second expansion times the coefficient from the first expansion.\n\nTherefore, applying that logic, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought about the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) being 20, leading to 120, but now I'm thinking it's 384. I need to resolve this.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nBut let me think about the structure of the product. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of the second polynomial. But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, perhaps it's considering the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6*20=120.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I think the intended answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with the binomial expansion for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients is indeed when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, if we take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and multiply it by the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, we get 384.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n$\\boxed{384}$"

    "text": " Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^{k}\\). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nIn this problem, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me write that out using the binomial theorem. So, \\((a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\). That means the expansion will have terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). Wait, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6. Okay, that's straightforward.\n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I also need to expand this using the binomial theorem. Let me write that out: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, each term in this expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). For example, when m=0, it's \\(c^6\\); when m=1, it's \\(6c^4\\); m=2 gives \\(15c^2\\); m=3 gives \\(20c^0 = 20\\); m=4 gives \\(15c^{-2}\\); m=5 gives \\(6c^{-4}\\); and m=6 gives \\(c^{-6}\\).\n\nNow, the original problem is the product of these two expansions: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply them together, each term from the first expansion will multiply each term from the second expansion.\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find all the terms in the product where the exponents of a and b are 2 each. That means, in the first expansion, I already have the term \\(6a^2b^2\\). Now, when I multiply this by each term from the second expansion, I need to see how it contributes to the overall coefficient.\n\nWait, no. Actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those terms will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of c, but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of c, I think that's not the case. Wait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but the entire product includes terms with different powers of c. So, actually, I think I need to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will multiply each term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is a constant (with respect to a and b) multiplied by a power of c, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of c, I think that's the case.\n\nWait, but actually, no. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply together to give that specific term. So, in this case, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, and since the second part doesn't involve a or b, every term in the second part will just multiply the entire first part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, that seems right. Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term is a constant (like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), etc.), so when you collect like terms for \\(a^2b^2\\), you'll have \\(6a^2b^2 \\times (c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6})\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6 \\times (1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1)\\), because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient to the overall coefficient when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but let me check that. So, the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, as I did earlier, gives terms with coefficients 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1. So, the sum of these coefficients is 1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1. Let me add that up.\n\n1 + 6 is 7, plus 15 is 22, plus 20 is 42, plus 15 is 57, plus 6 is 63, plus 1 is 64. So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. That makes sense because if you set c=1, then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), which is the sum of the coefficients. So, that's a good check.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first expansion) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients from the second expansion), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion? Because the second expansion doesn't involve a or b, so when you multiply it by \\(6a^2b^2\\), every term in the second expansion will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of c. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of c, right? So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because the second part doesn't involve a or b, so each term in the second part just scales the entire first part. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific k, then I would have to find the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second part. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of c, it's the sum of all possible coefficients when \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but actually, when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\), so the product becomes \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, for each m, you get a term with \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient to the term \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second expansion) = 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another approach. Let's consider that the entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a constant (with respect to a and b) and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient gets scaled by that constant. Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I wanted to compute the entire expansion, but that would be tedious, so I think this approach is correct.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the sum of coefficients in the second expansion. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) evaluated at c=1 is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), which is the sum of the coefficients. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is the product of two polynomials. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of the products of coefficients from each part where the exponents add up to \\(a^2b^2\\). But in this case, since the second part doesn't involve a or b, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiplying it by any term from the second part, because the second part doesn't affect the exponents of a and b. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to see it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum over all possible pairs of terms from each polynomial whose variables multiply to give that term. In this case, since the second polynomial has no a or b, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiplying it by any term from the second polynomial, which contributes its coefficient to the product. Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nSo, I think that's the correct answer. The coefficient is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\n\\]\nThe term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2 b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\nNext, we expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nThe coefficients of the terms in this expansion are the binomial coefficients \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\). The sum of these coefficients is found by evaluating the expression at \\(c = 1\\):\n\\[\n\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion:\n\\[\n6 \\times 64 = 384\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m}\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nOkay, so now I have both expansions. The original expression is the product of these two expansions. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider how the terms multiply together.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), right? Because the second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply them together, the variables involved in the second part are different. So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is entirely within the first expansion, and the second expansion's terms will multiply with it, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the variables in the second part won't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Is that correct?\n\nWait, no, maybe not exactly. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\) multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since the second expansion has terms with \\(c\\), \\(1/c\\), etc., when we multiply, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each of these would be separate terms, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would be the sum of all these coefficients multiplied by \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first expansion, and when you multiply it by the second expansion, you're just adding more variables. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion, because the second expansion doesn't affect the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Hmm, is that right?\n\nWait, no, I think I might be confusing something. Let me clarify. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, every term in the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Wait, but that can't be right because the second expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression with \\(c\\).\n\nWait, so maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is treating the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is raised to some power. But the way the problem is phrased, it just says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any condition on \\(c\\). Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is considering the entire expression as a product, and it's asking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient isn't just a number but a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems odd because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all terms, regardless of the \\(c\\) part. But that doesn't make much sense either because the expression is a product, so each term will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times 64\\)?\n\nWait, but that seems a bit off. Let me think again. If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\), which is \\(6a^2b^2\\). Then, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the entire term becomes \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not a number; it's an expression in terms of \\(c\\). So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and ignoring the \\(c\\) parts, but that doesn't make much sense because the expression is a product.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to approach it differently. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider how \\(a^2b^2\\) is formed. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, when I multiply this by the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the second expansion will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, effectively giving \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\times a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not a numerical coefficient; it's a coefficient that's a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some specific power of \\(c\\), but since it's not specified, perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient as a polynomial, which would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a number. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression as a single polynomial, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but in that case, the coefficient would indeed be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, but only considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts, which would mean that the coefficient is \\(6\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, setting \\(c = 1\\), the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, that seems plausible. Let me check. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But I'm not entirely sure if that's the correct approach because the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire product, not the sum of coefficients. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to treat \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) as separate variables and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would indeed be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the expansion is a product of two separate polynomials. Each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first polynomial, and it gets multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps it's expecting the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, multiplied by 6, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would indeed be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a number. So, maybe the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, implying that we should consider the entire expression and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible powers of \\(c\\), which would be the sum of coefficients in the second expansion multiplied by 6.\n\nWait, but let's approach it step by step. First, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is the middle term when \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Each term in this expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\). So, when we multiply the two expansions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that's multiplied by 6. But the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but that seems correct because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), and the sum of those coefficients is 64, so the total contribution is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire second expansion, which is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But if the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, perhaps it's considering the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, and then multiplying by 6 to get 384.\n\nWait, but perhaps another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in each part. But that's not quite right because the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so it's more about multiplying the coefficient from the first part by the entire second expansion.\n\nWait, no, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first part because the second part is multiplied by it, but that's not accurate because the second part is a separate expansion. So, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 times 64 is 384.\n\nLet me verify this with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion would be \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is \\(2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the product would be \\(1 \\times 2 = 2\\). Indeed, expanding it, we get \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, which matches. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) is also 2. So, this approach seems correct.\n\nTherefore, applying this to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake. Another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6 is being multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But if the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, perhaps it's expecting the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial multiplied by 6, which is 64 times 6, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is considering the entire expression as a product, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, but since the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, I think the intended answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check another angle. Suppose I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in the product, each term would be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so that part is fixed with coefficient 6. Then, the \\(c\\) part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\) for each \\(m\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, perhaps the problem is considering all terms where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), which is \\(6 \\times 2^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by taking the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), and multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\). Thus, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n$\\boxed{384}$"

    "text": " Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that when dealing with expressions like \\((a + b)^n\\), the coefficients of specific terms can be found using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem states that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^{k}\\). So, maybe I can use that here.\n\nIn this problem, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\). So, let me expand that using the binomial theorem. The expansion will be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\). I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), right? Because \\(a^{4 - k}b^k = a^2b^2\\) implies \\(4 - k = 2\\) so \\(k = 2\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire product. But wait, I'm only asked about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, so does that mean I don't need to consider the other part involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\)? Or do I?\n\nWait, no, because the entire expression is multiplied together. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and then it's multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), right?\n\nWait, but that can't be right because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, actually, when I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in that expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think again. Actually, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. But in this case, I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, in other words, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large. Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the question is asking for a numerical coefficient.

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a single number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so in other words, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out, making the term a constant. But the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let me think again. The problem is: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is considering the product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\).

But that doesn't make sense because the question is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach. Let's first expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and then consider the other part. The expansion is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier.\n\nNow, the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem. It would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so that can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. In that case, we need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times that constant term.\n\nLet me try that approach. So, first, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial expansion, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\).\n\nSo, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, the problem is probably asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nBut let me make sure. The problem says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's just considering the product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponents of \\(c\\) are such that they don't affect the coefficient, meaning that the term is \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a constant. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20, giving 120.\n\nYes, that seems more reasonable. So, the answer is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed when \\(k=3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of the entire product and how the terms interact. Each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. But that would be if we're considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), which seems unlikely because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\).\n\nWait, I'm getting conflicting results here. Let me clarify.\n\nIf the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so that can't be the case.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, then the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, giving 120.\n\nSince the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), but just asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's more likely that they're considering the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, making it a constant term. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe the answer is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the entire expression is a product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all terms in the second expansion, which would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire second factor, because when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by the entire second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire second polynomial, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which again doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the entire second expansion, so the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120.\n\nI think the correct approach is to consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second polynomial. But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\) expands to \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) in this product would be \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is presented as a numerical coefficient question.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the coefficient is 6 times the constant term in the second expansion, giving 120.\n\nWait, but in the example I just did, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is presented as a numerical coefficient question, so that can't be right.\n\nTherefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but to be thorough, let me compute the entire expansion and check.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nThen, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, the product is:\n\n\\[\n(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4) \\times \\left(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\right)\n\\]\n\nWhen we multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). But that is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a numerical coefficient. So, unless the problem is asking for a specific term involving \\(c\\), the coefficient can't be a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 times the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nAs established earlier, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We are interested in the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0), which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), i.e., \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient of this term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each expansion:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Hmm, okay. So, I think I need to expand both parts and then find the specific term. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider the expression \\((a + b)^4\\). I remember that when expanding binomials, I can use the binomial theorem, which states that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^{k}\\). So, applying this to \\((a + b)^4\\), each term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\).\n\nI'm specifically looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. So, in the binomial expansion, that would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) because \\(b^k\\) would be \\(b^2\\) when \\(k = 2\\). Let me compute that coefficient.\n\nThe binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!(4 - 2)!} = \\dfrac{24}{2 \\times 2} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part of the expression, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion will be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWait, but I'm not looking for a term in \\(c\\), I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Hmm, maybe I need to think about how the two expansions interact. Since the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when I multiply them together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion.\n\nBut the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, the \\(c\\) terms will just tag along as part of the product, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps I can ignore the \\(c\\) part when considering the coefficient.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because when I multiply the two expansions, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would come from taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and multiplying it by the constant term (if any) from the second expansion. Because if I take \\(a^2b^2\\) and multiply it by a term involving \\(c\\), then the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something like that, which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term (the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) in the second expansion.\n\nSo, let's think about that. The second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the constant term in this expansion. That is, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in the expansion, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). We set this equal to zero to find the value of \\(m\\):\n\n\\(6 - 2m = 0\\)\n\nSolving for \\(m\\):\n\n\\(2m = 6\\)\n\n\\(m = 3\\)\n\nSo, the constant term occurs when \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient for this term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that:\n\n\\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\)\n\nSo, the constant term is 20. That means when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by this constant term, the resulting term will be \\(6 \\times 20 \\times a^2b^2\\), which is \\(120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. From \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when I multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, giving \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the entire product, \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, each term in the product will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). To get a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\), we need the exponent of \\(a\\) to be 2 and the exponent of \\(b\\) to be 2. That happens when \\(k = 2\\) in the first binomial expansion, as we found earlier, giving a coefficient of 6. At the same time, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, which happens when \\(m = 3\\), giving a coefficient of 20. Since these two events are independent, their coefficients multiply, resulting in 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nSo, I think I've confirmed that the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nJust to make sure I haven't missed anything, let me consider if there are other terms that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). For example, could there be a term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that, when multiplied by a term from \\((a + b)^4\\), results in \\(a^2b^2\\)? Well, the only way that would happen is if the term from the second expansion is a constant, because otherwise, you'd have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something like that, which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the only contribution comes from the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120 is the correct coefficient.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is given by:\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{2} a^2 b^2\n\\]\nCalculating the binomial coefficient:\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). We need the constant term (the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero). Using the binomial theorem, each term is:\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nSetting the exponent equal to zero:\n\\[\n6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n\\]\nThe constant term is:\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{3} = \\frac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, we multiply the coefficient from the first expansion by the constant term from the second expansion:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Hmm, okay. So, I need to figure out the coefficient of a specific term in this product of two binomial expressions. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), the coefficients of the terms can be found using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, each term is a combination multiplied by the respective powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\nIn this case, the first part of the expression is \\((a + b)^4\\). So, applying the binomial theorem here, each term in the expansion will be \\(\\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. I'm specifically interested in the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, I need to find the term where \\(a^2 b^2\\). That would occur when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, substituting \\(k = 2\\), the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\).\n\nLet me compute that. \\(\\binom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the term \\(a^2 b^2\\). Since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's just a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when I multiply \\(a^2 b^2\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\) will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\) in the entire product. So, I think I might have misread that. Let me check again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\), which is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so it's in the first part of the product. The second part is only in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply the two expressions together, the term \\(a^2 b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), then in the product, \\(a^2 b^2\\) will be multiplied by the constant term (the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if I multiply \\(a^2 b^2\\) by any other term in the second expression, it will introduce \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which we don't want. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\) in the entire product is just 6 multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then multiply it by 6 to get the coefficient for \\(a^2 b^2\\) in the entire expression.\n\nOkay, so let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, we set the exponent equal to zero: \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the constant term is \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\binom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that's not right. Wait, 6! is 720, but 3! is 6, so 6!/(3!3!) is 720/(6*6) = 720/36 = 20. Hmm, but I thought \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\) was 20? Wait, actually, yes, that's correct because 6 choose 3 is 20. Wait, no, 6 choose 3 is actually 20? Let me check: 6*5*4/(3*2*1) = 120/6 = 20. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the term \\(a^2 b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20, so 6*20 is indeed 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nBut just to double-check, let me consider the entire expansion. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), has terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\), each with coefficients from the binomial coefficients. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), has terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\), with coefficients from the binomial coefficients as well.\n\nWhen you multiply these two together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2 b^2\\) (which is a specific term in the first expansion) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. However, only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero will contribute to a term that is just \\(a^2 b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) attached. So, that's why we only consider the constant term in the second expansion when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\) in the entire product.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 6 (from \\(a^2 b^2\\) in the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term in the second part), which equals 120.\n\nWait, but let me just verify that I didn't miss anything else. For example, is there a possibility that other terms in the first expansion could combine with terms in the second expansion to produce \\(a^2 b^2\\) multiplied by something else? But no, because \\(a^2 b^2\\) is only in the first part, and the second part only affects the \\(c\\) terms. So, when you multiply \\(a^2 b^2\\) by any term in the second expansion, you just get \\(a^2 b^2\\) times that term, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only consider the term in the second expansion that is 1 (the constant term). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6*20=120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we first determine the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNext, we identify the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

    "text": " Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with expressions like \\((a + b)^n\\), we can use the binomial theorem to expand them. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^{k}\\). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nIn this problem, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me write that expansion out. Using the binomial theorem, it would be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\n\\]\n\nSo, the terms in this expansion will be:\n\n- When \\(k = 0\\): \\(\\binom{4}{0} a^4 b^0 = 1 \\cdot a^4\\)\n- When \\(k = 1\\): \\(\\binom{4}{1} a^3 b^1 = 4 \\cdot a^3 b\\)\n- When \\(k = 2\\): \\(\\binom{4}{2} a^2 b^2 = 6 \\cdot a^2 b^2\\)\n- When \\(k = 3\\): \\(\\binom{4}{3} a^1 b^3 = 4 \\cdot a b^3\\)\n- When \\(k = 4\\): \\(\\binom{4}{4} a^0 b^4 = 1 \\cdot b^4\\)\n\nSo, looking at this, the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\) is 6. But wait, hold on, the problem isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by another expression: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nHmm, so I need to consider the entire product: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\). That term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), right? So, does that mean that the coefficient is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times whatever comes from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? But wait, no, because if we're multiplying two expressions, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion.\n\nWait a second, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think. When we have the product of two expressions, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2 b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by every term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\), and not involving \\(c\\), that means we're only interested in the terms where the power of \\(c\\) cancels out, so that when multiplied by \\(a^2 b^2\\), it doesn't introduce any \\(c\\) terms.\n\nWait, no, actually, that's not quite right. Let me clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\) in the entire expansion. But the entire expansion is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when we multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial.\n\nTherefore, the term \\(a^2 b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, is that correct? Because when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient for \\(a^2 b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But let me make sure.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Because if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\), that term in the product would only come from multiplying \\(a^2 b^2\\) from the first polynomial by any term from the second polynomial. But since the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), those terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\) in the entire product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial evaluated at \\(c = 1\\), because when you multiply by the second polynomial, each term contributes a factor that's multiplied by \\(a^2 b^2\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficients from the second polynomial will all add up.\n\nWait, that might be a better way to think about it. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2 b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each of those terms contributes a coefficient, and since we're only interested in the \\(a^2 b^2\\) term, regardless of the \\(c\\) part, those coefficients just add up.\n\nSo, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already did: it's 6.\n\nNext, we need to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). How do we do that? Well, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by evaluating the polynomial at \\(c = 1\\). Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) makes each term equal to its coefficient.\n\nSo, let's compute \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\).\n\nTherefore, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (from the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that logic. Because when we have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since we're looking for \\(a^2 b^2\\), which is only from the first polynomial, and the second polynomial doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so every term in the second polynomial, when multiplied by \\(a^2 b^2\\), contributes a multiple of \\(a^2 b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But since the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum over all the coefficients from the second polynomial. So yes, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that term. In this case, since \\(a^2 b^2\\) is only from the first polynomial, and the second polynomial's terms don't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), each term in the second polynomial will just multiply the \\(a^2 b^2\\) term by a coefficient, so the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me make sure that I'm not missing anything here. Let's consider a simpler case. Suppose we have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion would be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\n\\]\n\\[\n(c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\n\\]\nSo, the product is:\n\\[\n(a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c) = a^2 c + a^2 / c + 2ab c + 2ab / c + b^2 c + b^2 / c\n\\]\nNow, if we look for the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\), but in this product, there are no \\(a^2 b^2\\) terms because each term has either \\(a^2\\), \\(ab\\), or \\(b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\) would be zero, because there are no such terms.\n\nWait, but according to my earlier logic, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of coefficients in the second. But in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\) in the first polynomial is zero because \\((a + b)^2\\) only goes up to \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\), not \\(a^2 b^2\\). So, in that case, the total coefficient would be zero, which matches the actual expansion.\n\nWait, but in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\) in the first polynomial is 6, so when multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, gives 384. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of another example. Suppose we have \\((a + b)^3 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). Let's compute the coefficient of \\(a^2 b\\). In the first polynomial, \\((a + b)^3\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2 b\\) is 3. The sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is \\((1 + 1)^2 = 4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2 b\\) in the product would be 3 * 4 = 12. Let's check that by expanding.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^3 = a^3 + 3a^2 b + 3ab^2 + b^3\\).\n\nSecond, \\((c + 1/c)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\).\n\nMultiplying them together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(3a^2 b\\) from the first would be multiplied by \\(c^2\\), 2, and \\(1/c^2\\), giving:\n\n- \\(3a^2 b c^2\\)\n- \\(6a^2 b\\)\n- \\(3a^2 b / c^2\\)\n\nSo, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2 b\\) is 6, which is 3 (from the first) times 2 (the constant term in the second). Wait, that's different from my earlier conclusion. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2 b\\) is 6, but according to my previous logic, it should have been 3 * 4 = 12. So, that contradicts my earlier reasoning. Therefore, my earlier approach must be wrong.\n\nWait, so where did I go wrong? Let's analyze this carefully.\n\nIn the example I just did, the coefficient of \\(a^2 b\\) in the product is 6, but according to my earlier logic, it should be 3 (from the first) times 4 (sum of coefficients in the second) = 12. But that's not correct because in reality, it's only 6. So, my initial approach was incorrect.\n\nSo, perhaps I need a different approach. Let's think again.\n\nWhen we have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum over all pairs of coefficients from each polynomial whose variables multiply to give that term. So, in this problem, we're looking for \\(a^2 b^2\\). But in the second polynomial, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), all the terms are in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when we multiply by \\(a^2 b^2\\), each term in the second polynomial contributes a coefficient multiplied by \\(a^2 b^2\\), but with different powers of \\(c\\). However, the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean that all the coefficients from the second polynomial add up, and then multiplied by the coefficient from the first?\n\nWait, in the earlier example, when I took \\((a + b)^3 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2 b\\) in the product was 6, which is 3 (from the first) times 2 (the constant term in the second). So, that suggests that only the constant term in the second polynomial contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2 b\\), because if you have a term like \\(c^2\\) or \\(1/c^2\\), those would affect the power of \\(c\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2 b\\), regardless of \\(c\\), we have to consider all possible terms where the power of \\(c\\) is zero. Because if we have \\(a^2 b\\) multiplied by \\(c^k\\), then unless \\(k = 0\\), it's not just \\(a^2 b\\), it's \\(a^2 b c^k\\), which is a different term. So, perhaps in the original problem, we're only interested in the terms where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, so that when multiplied by \\(a^2 b^2\\), it remains \\(a^2 b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, in the product, the term \\(a^2 b^2\\) can only come from multiplying \\(a^2 b^2\\) from the first polynomial by the term in the second polynomial that is \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 (from the first) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial.\n\nIn the earlier example, the coefficient of \\(a^2 b\\) in the product was 6, which is 3 (from the first) multiplied by 2 (the constant term in the second). So, that aligns with this idea.\n\nSo, perhaps in the original problem, I was wrong before when I thought the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, and that the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. Instead, the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, which is the constant term, and then multiply that by 6.\n\nSo, let me correct my approach.\n\nFirst, in the first polynomial, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\) is 6.\n\nSecond, in the second polynomial, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term.\n\nSo, let's compute that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get:\n\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies 2k = 6 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), and its coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3! \\cdot (6 - 3)!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\cdot 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first polynomial) multiplied by 20 (from the second polynomial), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but that was based on a wrong assumption. Now, with this corrected approach, it's 120.\n\nLet me verify this with a concrete example. Let's take the same example as before: \\((a + b)^3 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^2\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2 b\\) should be 6, as we saw earlier.\n\nIn this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2 b\\) in the first polynomial is 3. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial is the constant term, which is \\(\\binom{2}{1} = 2\\). So, 3 * 2 = 6, which matches the actual expansion. So, this approach seems correct.\n\nTherefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the constant term in the second polynomial. Let me re-examine that.\n\nThe expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nWe need the term where the exponent is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\), as I calculated before. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but I'm confused because earlier I thought it was 384, but that was based on a wrong assumption. So, the correct answer should be 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, each term is a product of a term from the first polynomial and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2 b^2\\) can only come from the first polynomial, and then multiplied by any term from the second polynomial, but only the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, so that the resulting term is just \\(a^2 b^2\\). So, that's only the constant term from the second polynomial, which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check with another example to be absolutely sure. Let's take \\((a + b)^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^1\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\) in the first polynomial is zero, because \\((a + b)^2\\) only has up to \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\), not \\(a^2 b^2\\). So, the coefficient in the product should also be zero, which matches reality because when you multiply, you get terms like \\(a^2 c\\), \\(a^2 / c\\), etc., but no \\(a^2 b^2\\) term.\n\nAnother example: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\) is 6 (from the first) times 20 (from the second), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that in the expansion, the term \\(a^2 b^2\\) is indeed only multiplied by the constant term in the second polynomial. So, when I multiply \\(a^2 b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, I get terms like \\(a^2 b^2 c^6\\), \\(a^2 b^2 c^4\\), etc., but the only term that would result in \\(a^2 b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is when I multiply by the constant term, which is \\(c^0\\). So, that term is \\(a^2 b^2 \\times 20\\), giving \\(20 a^2 b^2\\). All other terms would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, so they wouldn't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\) alone.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but that was because I incorrectly assumed that all coefficients in the second polynomial contribute, which is only the case if we're looking for the coefficient of a term that includes all variables, but in this case, we're only looking for a term that doesn't include \\(c\\) at all, so only the constant term from the second polynomial contributes.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), and its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient of this term is:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Let me think about how to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that when expanding expressions like \\((a + b)^n\\), the coefficients can be found using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem states that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^{k}\\).

Got that part.\n\nNow, the original problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but in the second part, there's \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). How does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)?\n\nHmm, I think I need to consider that when I multiply the two expansions together, the terms from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I might not need to consider the \\(c\\) terms because they are separate variables. Wait, but the question is about the coefficient in the entire product. So, maybe I need to consider how the multiplication affects the coefficients.\n\nWait, but actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since we are only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other part is in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the variables are different. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be multiplied by a sum of terms involving \\(c\\).\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the product. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like it's not a single coefficient but rather a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the respective power of \\(c\\).\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Alternatively, maybe it's 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because only the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out would give a constant term, and thus the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times that.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\). It just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables are separate. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when you multiply it by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it will be \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all terms, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\), the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which usually refers to the numerical coefficient, treating all variables as separate. So, perhaps the answer is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems odd.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a numerical value. So, perhaps the problem is implicitly asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, in which case the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would be a very large number.\n\nWait, let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me look at the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by that term. So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut wait, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, let's calculate the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so:\n\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it again. Let me think differently.\n\nIn the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(a^k b^{4 - k} c^m\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) ranges from -6 to 6 in steps of 2, I think. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the other expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems like it's a polynomial, not a number.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient in the context of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is a misstatement, and it's actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120, as I calculated earlier. Alternatively, maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would be a polynomial, not a number.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, without considering the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6, and the \\(c\\) terms are separate. But that can't be right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from one is multiplied by each term from the other, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try a different approach. Let's consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so that can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, which would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), because the other part is in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are separate variables. So, the coefficient would just be 6. But that seems too simple, and I think the problem is expecting more.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems plausible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is a distractor. But that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, let me check the original problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the answer is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would be a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a number.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is a polynomial, but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, which suggests that perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out.\n\nSo, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which we calculated as 20, so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut which one is correct? Let me think again. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's ambiguous. But in standard terminology, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term in a product of polynomials, you consider the term in the combined variables. So, if the problem is asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), it's possible that they are considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, perhaps they are actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and they meant to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but they didn't specify. Given that, I think the most reasonable interpretation is that they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nBut let me confirm this. Let's consider that when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nTherefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, if they are asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut which interpretation is correct? Let me think about standard problems. Usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term in a product, you consider the term in the combined variables. So, if you're asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's ambiguous because \\(c\\) is another variable. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, I think the intended answer is 120.\n\nTherefore, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we start by expanding each part separately.\n\nFirst, using the binomial theorem, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\):\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found when \\(k = 2\\):\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

    "text": " Hmm, okay, so I need to figure out how to expand this expression and find the specific coefficient. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem, which involves combinations. The same goes for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So maybe I can handle each part separately and then multiply them together, but I'm not sure yet. Wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they might not affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Hmm, that might not be right, though, because when you multiply the two expansions together, the \\(c\\) terms could influence the coefficients. Wait, no, actually, since the \\(c\\) terms are separate, maybe I can treat them independently. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So when I expand both, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I might only need to consider the part of the expansion from \\((a + b)^4\\) that gives me \\(a^2b^2\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part because the \\(c\\) terms won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. Wait, no, that can't be right because each term in the product will be a combination of terms from both expansions. So maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, let me clarify: when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, if I'm looking for a term where the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) have exponents 2 and 2 respectively, then I need to find all possible ways that when I multiply a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the result has \\(a^2b^2\\). But since the second expression only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't be affected by the second expression. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, you have to consider each term.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients get multiplied as well. So, if I have a term \\(k \\cdot a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and a term \\(m \\cdot c^n\\) from the second expansion, then the product would be \\(k \\cdot m \\cdot a^2b^2c^n\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, I'm supposed to find all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the \\(c\\) part, and sum up their coefficients.\n\nWait, but that seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms, so the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right either. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, when you expand the product, each term will be of the form \\( (a^kb^{4 - k}) \\times (c^m \\times \\text{something}) \\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would come from when \\(k = 2\\) in the first expansion, and any \\(m\\) in the second expansion. But wait, no, because when you multiply, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will appear with each coefficient from the second expansion. So, the total coefficient would be (coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by (sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)).\n\nWait, but that seems a bit off. Let me check: If I have two expressions, say \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in their product \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\), because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed (coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\)) times (sum of coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\)).\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me take a simple example. Suppose \\(P(a, b) = a + b\\) and \\(Q(c) = c + 1\\). Then, the product is \\((a + b)(c + 1)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) in this product is the coefficient of \\(a\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) is 1, and the sum of coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\) is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product is 1 * 2 = 2, which is correct because the product is \\(ac + a + bc + b\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 (from \\(a\\)) plus \\(c\\) (from \\(ac\\)), but wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1, because it's only present in the term \\(a \\times 1\\). Wait, that contradicts my earlier thought. Hmm, so maybe my initial idea was wrong.\n\nWait, so in that example, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product is 1, not 2. So, perhaps my approach was incorrect. So, maybe I can't just multiply the coefficients like that. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficients would be multiplied as well. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but in the example I tried, that didn't hold.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach it differently. Let me try to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is the sum from k=0 to 4 of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^k b^{4 - k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6.\n\nNow, the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand this using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is the sum from m=0 to 6 of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^m \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{6 - m}\\), which simplifies to the sum from m=0 to 6 of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{m - (6 - m)}\\) which is \\(c^{2m - 6}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{2m - 6}\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes its coefficient to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nWait, but in my earlier example, that didn't hold. Let me check that again. In the example, \\(P(a, b) = a + b\\) and \\(Q(c) = c + 1\\). The product is \\((a + b)(c + 1) = ac + a + bc + b\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) in this product is 1 (from the term \\(a\\)) plus \\(c\\) (from the term \\(ac\\)), but that's not just the coefficient from \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of coefficients from \\(Q(c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) is 1, and the sum of coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\) is 2, so 1 * 2 = 2, but in reality, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product is 1. So, that approach is incorrect.\n\nHmm, so maybe my initial assumption was wrong. So, perhaps I can't just multiply the coefficients like that. So, what's the correct way?\n\nWait, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) only if the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents, but in reality, each term in the product is a combination of an \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) term and a \\(c\\) term. So, when you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), you're considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that gets multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but in the example, that didn't hold. So, perhaps I'm making a mistake in that reasoning. Let me think again. In the example, \\(P(a, b) = a + b\\), \\(Q(c) = c + 1\\). The product is \\(ac + a + bc + b\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product is 1 (from \\(a \\times 1\\)) plus \\(c\\) (from \\(a \\times c\\)). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is actually \\(1 + c\\), which is a polynomial, not a constant. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^1\\) is \\(1 + c\\), which is not just the product of coefficients.\n\nWait, so perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is not a constant but a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which might just be the coefficient without considering the \\(c\\) terms, or perhaps it's considering the entire term. Wait, no, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so perhaps it's referring to the coefficient when considering the entire expression, including all powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial, but the problem might be expecting a numerical coefficient, which would only make sense if we're considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but that seems conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to compute the product step by step.\n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this is:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k} a^k b^{4 - k}\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNext, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, this is:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{6 - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{m - (6 - m)} = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{2m - 6}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{2m - 6}\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we get:\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k} a^k b^{4 - k}\\right) \\times \\left(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{2m - 6}\\right)\n\\]\n\nWhen we multiply these two sums, each term from the first sum is multiplied by each term from the second sum. So, the product will be a double sum:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^4 \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{4}{k} \\dbinom{6}{m} a^k b^{4 - k} c^{2m - 6}\n\\]\n\nNow, we are interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need to find all terms in this double sum where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively. That means we need \\(k = 2\\) and \\(4 - k = 2\\), which is consistent because \\(k = 2\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, for each \\(m\\), the term where \\(k = 2\\) and any \\(m\\) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient will be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), because \\(k = 2\\) is fixed.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(2m - 6\\), but we are only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\).\n\nBut wait, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, so the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m}\\).\n\nNow, \\(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m}\\) is the sum of the binomial coefficients for \\(n = 6\\), which is equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me check that again because in my earlier example, this approach didn't work. Let me verify with the example.\n\nIn the example, \\(P(a, b) = a + b\\) and \\(Q(c) = c + 1\\). The product is \\((a + b)(c + 1) = ac + a + bc + b\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1\\), which is a polynomial. But according to the approach above, the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{1}{1} \\times (1 + 1) = 1 \\times 2 = 2\\), which is incorrect because the coefficient is \\(c + 1\\), not 2. So, this suggests that my approach is wrong.\n\nWait, so perhaps the mistake is that I'm considering the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, but in reality, when you multiply by each term, the coefficients get multiplied by the variables, so the overall coefficient is a polynomial, not a constant. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually \\(6 \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\right)\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a bit ambiguous because it could mean the coefficient as a polynomial in \\(c\\), or perhaps the numerical coefficient when considering all possible \\(c\\) terms.\n\nWait, maybe I misinterpreted the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem didn't specify, so maybe I should assume that it's asking for the coefficient as a polynomial, which would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\right)\\).\n\nBut that seems too complicated, and in the example, it didn't hold. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in the example, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product was \\(c + 1\\), which is not a constant. So, perhaps the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, but that's only possible if the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a constant term in the second expansion.\n\nWait, in the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(2m - 6 = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient of the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, perhaps that's the answer.\n\nWait, but then in the example, the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be the coefficient from the first expansion times the constant term in the second expansion. In the example, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) is 1, and the constant term in \\(Q(c)\\) is 1, so the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be 1 * 1 = 1, which is correct because the term \\(a\\) comes from \\(a \\times 1\\). But in reality, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product was \\(c + 1\\), so that approach is also incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would include all the \\(c\\) terms. But the problem didn't specify, so maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\right)\\). But that seems unlikely because usually, when someone asks for the coefficient of a term, they might be referring to the numerical coefficient, not a polynomial.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in the second expansion, which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I'm not sure. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's considering the coefficient as a polynomial in \\(c\\), which would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\right)\\), but that seems too involved.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, so the answer would be 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought earlier, because the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut in the example, that approach didn't work because the coefficient was a polynomial, not a constant. So, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient to be 384, treating the entire product as a polynomial where the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384 times some combination of \\(c\\) terms. But that seems inconsistent with standard terminology.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating again. Let me try to think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the product would be the sum of all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is only interested in the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), then the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's expecting the coefficient to be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 384.\n\nWait, to confirm, let me compute the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of coefficients is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384.\n\nWait, but in the example, when I set \\(c = 1\\), the product becomes \\((a + b)(1 + 1) = 2(a + b)\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, which is indeed the coefficient from the first expansion times the sum of coefficients from the second expansion. So, that seems to hold.\n\nTherefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me compute \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) when \\(c = 1\\): it's \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), so the sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, when I multiply by \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n$\\boxed{384}$"

    "text": " Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with expressions like \\((a + b)^n\\), we can use the binomial theorem to expand them. The binomial theorem states that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, maybe I can apply this here.\n\nThe problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), I need to find the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. Let me write that out.\n\nFor \\((a + b)^4\\), the general term is \\(\\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). We want \\(a^2b^2\\), so \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient here would be \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\binom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to figure out how this affects the coefficient. Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and we're multiplying by another expression, the entire coefficient will be the product of the coefficients from each part.\n\nWait, but hold on. Actually, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is just one part, and it's multiplied by some term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that term is independent of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because \\(c\\) is another variable. So, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a term that is a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), but not necessarily a constant overall.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again.\n\nThe expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's possible that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some constant from the second expansion, but perhaps the second expansion doesn't affect the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second part is a separate expression. So, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, if you have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part with coefficient 6, and then you multiply by the entire second part, which is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire second expression. But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, implying a numerical value.\n\nWait, maybe I misinterpret the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the question is considering all variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, but that term might also involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Hmm, but the way it's phrased, it's only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps we need to sum over all the possible coefficients from the second expansion, multiplied by the coefficient from the first part.\n\nWait, but that doesn't quite make sense. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that is, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to approach it differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, and that term is multiplied by some term from the second expansion. But since the second expansion involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are separate variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. Because otherwise, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would involve terms with various powers of \\(c\\), and it's unclear what the problem is asking for.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be 6 times a sum of terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But that would mean the coefficient isn't a single number, which contradicts the problem's phrasing.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the \\(c\\) terms are irrelevant because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest is just multiplied along. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply by the second expression, it's a sum of terms, so each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the entire sum of the second expansion, which would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's not a single number.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion.\n\nSo, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the middle term, which occurs when the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. Let me calculate that.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\).\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\binom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying \\(c\\). So, maybe I was overcomplicating it by considering \\(c^0\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be 6 times a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a single number.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nHmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me try to clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and then it's multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient isn't a single number but a sum of terms involving \\(c\\).\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a number. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), considering all variables, but only looking for the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which again isn't a single number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears with \\(c^0\\), meaning that the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a single number.\n\nSo, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), giving 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's not a single number. So, perhaps the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nWait, let me check that again.\n\nSo, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, when we multiply these two parts, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering only the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), is 120.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 120.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me confirm that.\n\nSo, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives a term with \\(c^0\\) when \\(k = 3\\), which has coefficient 20. Therefore, the product would have the term \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20c^0 = 120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 120.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that when dealing with expressions like \\((a + b)^n\\), we can use the binomial theorem to expand them. The binomial theorem states that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLooking at the problem, I see that the expression is a product of two binomials raised to different powers: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but the second part of the product involves \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), which don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) won't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)?\n\nLet me think. If I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then perhaps I can first find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then consider how it interacts with the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\) are separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), their expansion won't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that doesn't sound quite right.\n\nWait, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, but since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all products will just be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part.\n\nWait, but actually, that might not be the case. Let me clarify. Let me denote the first part as \\(P = (a + b)^4\\) and the second part as \\(Q = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we multiply \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\), every term in \\(P\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(Q\\). So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\), which are terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider only the terms in \\(Q\\) that are constants, because if there's a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) term, the product would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or similar, which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the only term in \\(Q\\) that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) is the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product \\(P \\times Q\\) is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(Q\\).\n\nOkay, so first, let me find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). So, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs is when \\(4 - k = 2\\), which implies \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\binom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the constant term in this expansion because that's the term that won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied. So, let's expand this using the binomial theorem as well.\n\nThe expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, this becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the constant term is \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\binom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, actually, that's not correct. Wait, 6! is 720, and 3! is 6, so 720/(6*6) is 720/36, which is indeed 20. So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) and 20 (the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that I didn't make a mistake in calculating the constant term. Let me recalculate \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\). 6 choose 3 is indeed 20 because 6*5*4/(3*2*1) = 120/6 = 20. So that's correct.\n\nSo, yes, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I'm only considering the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part and the constant term from the second part, because any other term in the second part would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), making the term not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the entire expression is a product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, but wait, no, that's not correct because only the constant term in the second part will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term without introducing any \\(c\\) terms. So, it's not the sum of all coefficients, but just the constant term.\n\nWait, actually, no. Wait, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which would give \\( (1 + 1/1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). But in our case, we're only interested in the constant term, which is 20, not the sum of all coefficients. So, I think my initial approach is correct.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n2. Constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n3. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think if there's another approach. Maybe using multinomial coefficients or something else, but I think the way I did it is straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider the entire product and see how \\(a^2b^2\\) comes about, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are only in the second, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and the constant term from the second part. So, that's consistent with what I did earlier.\n\nSo, I think my answer is correct: 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\), which implies \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). The constant term is:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the constant term from the second part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

The binomial theorem states that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^{k}\\).

Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6.\n\nBut hold on, the original problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider the expansion of both parts and then multiply them together. However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to expand the entire expression. Let me think.\n\nActually, the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when I multiply the two expansions together, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms won't interact with the \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms. That means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not quite right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. However, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, when you expand the entire expression, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe it's just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which is a polynomial, not a single number. That doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, maybe they're considering the product as a single expression and looking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But the problem doesn't specify a particular power of \\(c\\), so perhaps the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(c\\) is separate, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because usually, when asked for a coefficient, it's a constant. Maybe the question is only considering the part with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and ignoring the \\(c\\) part? That seems unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. Since the expression is a product of two separate binomials, \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when you multiply them out, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since the variables \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\) are all distinct, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be multiplied by every term from the other expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a specific power of \\(c\\). But the problem doesn't specify, so maybe I'm supposed to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean summing over all possible coefficients from the \\(c\\) part. That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. That doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(c^0\\) would make the term independent of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nThat makes sense. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's compute that.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6*6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20. When you multiply these two, you get \\(6 * 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the entire expansion, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 will result in a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\) (since \\(c^0 = 1\\)). All other terms would have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), which would make them different terms. Therefore, the only contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the term where \\(c^0\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), which is why we multiply the coefficients 6 and 20 to get 120.\n\nSo, I think that's the correct approach. Let me recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem and find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20.\n\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together to get 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the final coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

If that's the case, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Then, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the middle term when expanded. Let me calculate that.\n\nThe expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be found using the binomial theorem: \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but the question didn't specify the \\(c\\) term, just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, if I'm correct, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because coefficients are numbers. So, perhaps the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). That would make the coefficient 120, as I calculated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a number. So, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations. In \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, in the entire product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{m} \\times c^{-n}\\), but actually, in the expansion, it's more precise to say that each term is \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^{6 - 2m}\\), where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6 \\times 6a^2b^2c^5\\), etc. Wait, no, that's not correct. Actually, when you multiply the two expansions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). But that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. Therefore, if the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's that polynomial. But that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient.\n\nTherefore, I think the intended question is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). As I calculated earlier, that would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me check again. If I consider the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me see if there's another way. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any integer \\(k\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. So, that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^{10}\\) or something like that, but as it is, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me think of it as the product of two separate expansions. The first expansion, \\((a + b)^4\\), has terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), has terms involving \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^5\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the entire expansion of the second part multiplied by 6. But that's a polynomial, not a single number.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). As I found earlier, that coefficient is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because coefficients are numerical.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to be interpreted as finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and since they're separate variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest is separate. But that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would involve the entire expansion of the second part.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of it as two separate problems. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), has a term \\(20c^0\\). So, when you multiply them together, the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) has a coefficient of \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120.\n\nBut the problem didn't specify the \\(c\\) term, so perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number. So, I think the intended answer is 120, assuming that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that seems unlikely because coefficients are numerical. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me think of it differently. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, so the coefficient in the product would be 6 times 64 = 384. But that's not correct because setting \\(c = 1\\) would make all the \\(c\\) terms disappear, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is indeed 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. But that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which is 384. But that contradicts my earlier conclusion of 120.\n\nWait, so which is it? If I set \\(c = 1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64 = 384. But that's if I'm considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Alternatively, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120.\n\nI think the confusion arises from whether the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), or just the term where \\(c^0\\) is involved.\n\nIf the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would be 6 times 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's the intended interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 times 20 = 120.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the problem as written: \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". So, in the product, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in the first expansion with coefficient 6, and it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that seems unlikely because coefficients are numerical.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^{10}\\) or something else, but as it is, I think the intended answer is 120, assuming that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Since the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384.\n\nWait, but that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's the intended interpretation. Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then each term in the product is a term from the first expansion times a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^5\\), \\(15c^4\\), etc., up to \\(c^{-6}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nI think that's the correct interpretation. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Hmm, okay, so I need to figure out how to approach this. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the expression is a product of two binomial expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but in the second part, it's involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, does that mean the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\)? Because if I'm looking for a term that only has \\(a^2b^2\\), then the powers of \\(c\\) must cancel out. So, maybe I need to find terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that result in \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term, and then multiply that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\).\n\nLet me write this down to clarify:\n\n1. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\).\n2. Find the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression.\n\nThat makes sense because when you multiply the two expansions, the terms will multiply each other, so to get \\(a^2b^2\\), the other part must contribute a term that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), which would be a constant term in this case.\n\nOkay, starting with the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). I remember that the expansion of \\((a + b)^n\\) is given by the binomial theorem, which states that:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^{k}\n\\]\n\nSo, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the general term is \\(\\binom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\). We need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), which means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\binom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the constant term in this expansion. Again, using the binomial theorem, each term in the expansion is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero for the constant term, so:\n\n\\[\n6 - 2m = 0 \\implies 2m = 6 \\implies m = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\). Calculating the coefficient:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\n\\]\n\nWait, hold on, let me check that calculation again because 6! is 720, and 3! is 6, so 6 \u00d7 6 is 36, and 720 divided by 36 is indeed 20. So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, putting it all together: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the constant term in the second part is 20. So, when we multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by the constant term 20. Therefore, the overall coefficient is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, is that it? Hmm, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is the product of the two binomials. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first binomial, and the second binomial contributes a constant term, so when you multiply them, the coefficient is indeed the product of the two coefficients. So, 6 \u00d7 20 is 120. That seems right.\n\nLet me just recap to ensure I didn't skip any steps or make any mistakes:\n\n1. Expanded \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem and found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n2. Expanded \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and found the constant term (which is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) is 20.\n3. Multiplied the two coefficients together to get 120.\n\nYes, that seems correct. I don't think I made any calculation errors. Let me just verify the binomial coefficients again:\n\n- For \\((a + b)^4\\), \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\) is 6, correct.\n- For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\) is 20, correct.\n\nSo, 6 \u00d7 20 is indeed 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiplying the coefficients:**\n\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the overall coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."
