    "text": " Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that when you expand a binomial like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can use the binomial theorem, which says that each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{n}{k}a^{n - k}b^k\\). So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion will have terms like \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4.\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), I just need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\) and \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). So, solving \\(4 - k = 2\\) gives \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. But wait, that's just the first part of the expression. The entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, I think I need to consider the entire product. But, wait, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion.\n\nBut the problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we don't need to worry about the other variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) because they won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the variables from the second part don't interfere. Wait, no, that's not quite right.\n\nWait, no, when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider all possible terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each. But since the second expression doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), only \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the terms in the second expansion don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is a sum of terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire second expansion. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, so perhaps they just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient would then be a polynomial, not a single number.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms, but since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because usually, when asked for a coefficient, it's a single number. So, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(c\\) is separate, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is a bit unusual.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but since \\(c\\) is another variable, the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a constant, not a sum.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, maybe I misread the problem, and it's actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, to find that, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). As I did earlier, that's \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNext, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do this, I'll use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we multiply the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)) gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and \\(c^0\\) comes from the second part. When you multiply these together, the term is \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem was just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient, I think it's more likely that they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems odd because usually, when you're asked for a coefficient, it's a constant unless specified otherwise.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which seems unusual.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible terms, but that would still involve \\(c\\) terms.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, and since \\(c\\) is another variable, the coefficient is just 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is 6 times that expansion, which would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\right)\\). But that seems too involved, and the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but considering only the constant term in \\(c\\). So, that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 times 20, which is 120. That makes sense because then the answer is a single number.\n\nSo, to confirm, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct. Let me expand both parts step by step.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6.\n\nNext, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand this:\n\nThe expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, the terms are:\n\n- \\(k=0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1 \\times c^6 = c^6\\)\n- \\(k=1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^{4} = 6c^4\\)\n- \\(k=2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^{2} = 15c^2\\)\n- \\(k=3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\)\n- \\(k=4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(k=5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(k=6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion.\n\nBut we are interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\right)\\).\n\nBut that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems odd. However, if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then perhaps the answer is that polynomial. But that seems unlikely because usually, when you're asked for a coefficient, it's a constant unless specified otherwise.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering only the terms where \\(c\\) is raised to a specific power, but the problem doesn't specify. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and since \\(c\\) is another variable, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\right)\\). But that seems too complicated, and I think the problem is expecting a numerical answer.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, which would indeed be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient would then be a polynomial.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\), i.e., the term where \\(c^0\\). So, that would be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nI think that's the intended interpretation because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial, which is less likely what the problem is asking for. So, I'll proceed under that assumption.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\): that's 6.\n2. Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\): that's 20.\n3. Multiply them together to get 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\), is 120.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think about another approach. Maybe using generating functions or considering the entire expansion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be \\(6c^6 + 36c^4 + 90c^2 + 120 + 90/c^2 + 36/c^4 + 6/c^6\\). But that seems too involved, and the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me confirm by another method. Let's consider the entire product:\n\n\\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\n\\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\).\n\nNow, when you multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the entire second expansion. So, the coefficient is 6 times each term in the second expansion, which gives:\n\n6c^6 + 36c^4 + 90c^2 + 120 + 90/c^2 + 36/c^4 + 6/c^6.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is this entire expression. However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient is indeed this polynomial. But that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a single number.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. So, perhaps the problem is intended to be interpreted that way.\n\nGiven that, I think the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Suppose I consider the entire expansion of the product. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it will be multiplied by every term in that expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is a bit odd.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but the problem doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut that seems too involved, so perhaps the intended answer is 120, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\).\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but if we're looking for the coefficient as a numerical value, perhaps it's 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 would be 384. But that seems too high, and I don't think that's what the problem is asking.\n\nWait, no, because the sum of coefficients is when you set \\(c = 1\\), but in this case, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is different.\n\nI think the confusion arises because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, perhaps the answer is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient, maybe it's expecting a specific term, like the constant term in \\(c\\), which would be 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so the coefficient is 6 times the expansion, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about it differently. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Since the product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is 6 times that expansion, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But if the problem is just asking for the coefficient, perhaps it's expecting the polynomial. But that seems too involved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which is probably not what the problem is asking for.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, and since \\(c\\) is another variable, the coefficient is just 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is 6 times that expansion, which is \\(6c^6 + 36c^4 + 90c^2 + 120 + 90/c^2 + 36/c^4 + 6/c^6\\).\n\nBut that seems too detailed, and the problem is probably expecting a single number. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\), which is 120.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n2. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n3. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nThus, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step. I think I can tackle each part separately and then combine the results. \n\nFirst, let's look at the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). I remember that when expanding binomials, we can use the binomial theorem, which says that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^{k}\\). So, applying this to \\((a + b)^4\\), each term will be \\(\\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\). \n\nI need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. So, let's see what \\(k\\) would be for that. If \\(a\\) is squared, then \\(4 - k = 2\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\). \n\nCalculating that, \\(\\binom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. \n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider how this interacts with the first part. But wait, the first part is only in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), while the second part is in terms of \\(c\\). So, actually, when I multiply these two expressions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. \n\nBut the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second part, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will only come from the first part. The second part doesn't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), it only affects the powers of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, so does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6? Because when we multiply by the second part, each term in the first part is multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe it's just 6 multiplied by the entire second expansion? But that doesn't make sense because we're looking for a specific term. \n\nWait, no, actually, I think I need to consider that when we multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term from the first part, and the second part has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. \n\nWait, no, that might not be right. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, if I'm looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), that term only comes from the first part, and the second part would contribute a term that's 1, because if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then perhaps I need to consider the entire expansion of the second part. \n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify. The original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when expanded, each term will be of the form \\( \\text{(term from first expansion)} \\times \\text{(term from second expansion)} \\). \n\nSo, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term is present only in the first part. The second part will contribute terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is a polynomial, not a single coefficient. \n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. But in this case, the desired term is \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. \n\nBut we are just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, does that mean that the coefficient is the same as in the first part, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part? \n\nWait, but the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in this expansion would be when \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by 64, giving \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me check. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and the second part is multiplied as a whole, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as in the first part, because the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). \n\nBut that can't be right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, but since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we need to consider how many times \\(a^2b^2\\) appears in the product. \n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first part. The second part doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply, \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. \n\nWait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think differently. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, when you expand the entire expression, each term will have some combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nBut the sum of all coefficients in the second part is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), as I thought earlier. So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the \\(c\\) terms are separate. But that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product, so each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. \n\nWait, but if we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be the same as in the first part, because the second part is multiplied as a whole. So, maybe the coefficient is just 6. \n\nI'm confused now. Let me try to clarify. \n\nWhen you have two polynomials multiplied together, say P(a, b) * Q(c), the coefficient of a specific term in P that doesn't involve c will be multiplied by each term in Q(c). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in P(a, b), then in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in Q(c). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from P(a, b) times the sum of all coefficients in Q(c). \n\nSo, as before, the coefficient from P(a, b) is 6, and the sum of coefficients in Q(c) is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, let me check this with a simpler example. Suppose P(a, b) = (a + b)^1 = a + b, and Q(c) = (c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c. Then, the product is (a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c. \n\nNow, if I look for the coefficient of \\(a\\), which is a term from P(a, b), it's multiplied by each term in Q(c). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product is 1 (from P) multiplied by the sum of coefficients in Q(c), which is 1 + 1 = 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product is 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) is also 2. \n\nBut in reality, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 for each term it's multiplied by, so in the product, the coefficients are 1 (for a c) and 1 (for a/c), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) is actually 2. So, that works out. \n\nSo, applying that logic, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the sum of coefficients in Q(c), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me think about the general case. If I have two polynomials, P and Q, where P has variables x, y and Q has variables z, then when I multiply P * Q, the coefficient of a term like x^k y^m in P is multiplied by each term in Q, so the coefficient of x^k y^m in the product is the same as in P multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q. \n\nYes, that makes sense. Because when you multiply by Q, each term in P is scaled by each term in Q, so the coefficient of x^k y^m in the product is the coefficient in P times the sum of coefficients in Q. \n\nTherefore, in this problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me check the second part again. The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of its coefficients is when c = 1, which is (1 + 1)^6 = 64, as I thought. So, that part is correct. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut I'm still a bit unsure because sometimes when you have multiple variables, the coefficients can interact differently, but in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think this approach is correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the second part is multiplied as a whole, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest is about \\(c\\). But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient, not the entire term, it's 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think 384 is the correct coefficient. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I have P(a, b) = (a + b)^4 and Q(c) = (c + 1/c)^6. Then, the product is P(a, b) * Q(c). \n\nIf I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term comes only from P(a, b). In P(a, b), the coefficient is 6. Then, in Q(c), the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, when you multiply P(a, b) by Q(c), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in Q(c), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nYes, that seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, if I were to expand the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from Q(c), so the coefficient would indeed be 6 * 64. \n\nTherefore, I think the coefficient is 384. \n\nBut wait, let me check with another approach. Maybe I can consider that the second part is a separate variable, so when I look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). \n\nBut that can't be right because when you multiply, each term in P(a, b) is multiplied by each term in Q(c). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in P(a, b), and in the product, it's multiplied by each term in Q(c). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from P(a, b) times the sum of coefficients in Q(c). \n\nYes, that's consistent with what I thought earlier. So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nI think that's the correct answer. \n\nWait, but let me think about it differently. Suppose I set \\(c = 1\\). Then, the second part becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 * 64\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this is 6 * 64 = 384, which matches what I found earlier. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, by substituting \\(c = 1\\), I can find the sum of all coefficients in the second part, and then multiply by the coefficient from the first part. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. \n\nI think that's the correct answer. I'll go with that.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Evaluate the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " Hmm, that seems like it involves binomial expansions. I remember that when you have expressions raised to powers, you can use the binomial theorem to expand them. But I'm a bit confused because there are two separate parts here: one involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). \n\nFirst, maybe I should expand each part separately and then see how they interact. Let me start with the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this should expand to the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\). So, each term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\).\n\nI'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, let me calculate that coefficient. The binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6. So, the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. Now, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to figure out how this interacts with the first part. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient is just 6, regardless of the second part?\n\nWait, no, that can't be right. Because the entire expression is a product of the two expansions. So, actually, every term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can consider that term as a standalone term multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right either. Because when we multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, because any term involving \\(c\\) would not affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. \n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Because when you multiply, you have to consider all possible products, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by the constant term (with respect to \\(c\\)) from the second part. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nTo find the constant term, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the sum from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m}\\) which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). \n\nTherefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the constant term in the second part is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 and 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has a constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) of 20. Since we're multiplying these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but only the constant term contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term without any \\(c\\) factors. All other terms in the second expansion would introduce \\(c\\) terms, which would make the overall term have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something, but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), we only consider the constant term from the second expansion.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe I should write out the product more explicitly. So, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). \n\nNow, when we multiply these two expansions, each term in the first will be multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, \\(6a^2b^2 * c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2 * 6c^4\\), \\(6a^2b^2 * 15c^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2 * 20\\), and so on. \n\nBut when we collect like terms, the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) is the one where we multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by 20, which gives \\(120a^2b^2\\). All other terms would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, so they wouldn't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nSo, I think that's the answer. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by expanding each part separately and then considering the product. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)** using the binomial theorem:\n   - The term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   - The constant term (when exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs at \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients** from both expansions:\n   - \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but let me try to break it down step by step. \n\nFirst, I know that when dealing with expressions raised to a power, the binomial theorem is super useful. The binomial theorem says that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^{k}\\). So, maybe I can apply this theorem to both parts of the expression separately and then see how they interact.\n\nLet me start with the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this would expand to the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\). So, each term in this expansion is of the form \\(\\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\).\n\nNow, I'm specifically looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, right? Because the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the term where \\(a^{2}\\) and \\(b^{2}\\) appear.\n\nLet me think: If \\(a\\) is raised to the power of \\(4 - k\\) and \\(b\\) is raised to the power of \\(k\\), then to get \\(a^2b^2\\), I need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, solving for \\(k\\), \\(4 - k = 2\\) gives \\(k = 2\\). That makes sense. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\binom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. So, the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\).\n\nOkay, that's the first part. Now, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder how this part interacts with the first part. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), does that mean that the \\(c\\) terms can be ignored? Wait, no, that can't be right because the entire expression is the product of these two expansions. So, maybe I need to consider how the terms multiply together.\n\nWait, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and when I multiply it by terms from the second expansion, it might combine with other terms. However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe I need to find the term in the second expansion that is a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) because multiplying by a constant won't change the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Alternatively, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps I can consider the product as a whole, but I think I might need to clarify that.\n\nWait, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, so perhaps I need to consider all possible ways that \\(a^2b^2\\) can be formed when multiplying the two expansions. But wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first expansion, and when multiplied by the second expansion, which involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the resulting terms would involve \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Hmm, but that doesn't make much sense because in the product, each term would have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) as separate variables, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the sum of all possible coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, because each term in the second expansion would be multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, no, that might not be right. Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then when I multiply these two, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, I get terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each of these terms would be \\(6 \\times \\binom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(6 \\times \\binom{6}{m}\\), because each term contributes \\(6 \\times \\binom{6}{m}\\) to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\). But wait, that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all \\(\\binom{6}{m}\\) multiplied by 6, which is 6 times the sum of \\(\\binom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\).\n\nBut the sum of \\(\\binom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's correct because I'm considering all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) term.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, which is \\(6 \\times 2^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all terms involving different powers of \\(c\\).\n\nBut wait, another thought: maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would include all the possible coefficients from the second expansion. So, yes, that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm interpreting the problem correctly. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\"\n\nSo, in the entire product, each term is of the form \\(a^k b^{4 - k} c^m / c^n\\) or something like that. Wait, actually, each term in the product is a term from the first expansion times a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, and when multiplied by any term from the second expansion, it would create a term like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{6 - 2m}\\) where \\(m\\) is from 0 to 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(6 \\times \\binom{6}{m}\\), because each term from the second expansion is multiplied by 6.\n\nSo, the sum of \\(\\binom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\), so the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check another approach. Alternatively, maybe I can treat the two expansions separately and see how the coefficients combine. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion.\n\nIn the first expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as we found earlier. The second expansion, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms with coefficients \\(\\binom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m\\) from 0 to 6. The sum of these coefficients is indeed \\(2^6 = 64\\), because when you substitute \\(c = 1\\), the expression becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there a possibility that when multiplying the two expansions, \\(a^2b^2\\) could be formed in another way? For example, maybe through cross terms where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms. But no, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so when you multiply terms from the first expansion by terms from the second, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) only come from the first expansion, and the exponents of \\(c\\) come from the second.\n\nTherefore, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and multiply it by any term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nSo, I think that's the answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI don't see any errors in that reasoning, so I think the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by considering the expansion of each part separately. Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when dealing with expansions, the binomial theorem is super useful. Maybe I should start by expanding each part separately and then see how they combine. \n\nFirst, let's consider the \\((a + b)^4\\) part. Using the binomial theorem, which states that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^{k}\\). So, applying this to \\((a + b)^4\\), each term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\). \n\nI need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me calculate that. The binomial coefficient here is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. So the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). \n\nNow, that's just the first part. The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to figure out how this interacts with the first expansion. But wait, the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they are separate variables. \n\nWait, hold on. The entire expression is a product of two expansions: one in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So when I multiply them, the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all separate. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think I just need to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the entire second expansion. \n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because the second expansion has multiple terms. So maybe the question is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So in that case, since the first part gives \\(6a^2b^2\\), and the second part is multiplied by it, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that seems too broad. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But the way the problem is phrased, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe the \\(c\\) terms don't affect it. So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6, and the rest is separate. \n\nBut wait, that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient isn't a single number but a polynomial in \\(c\\). \n\nHmm, that's confusing. Maybe I need to clarify the question. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a+b)^4\\left(c+\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps it's considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). \n\nIn that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. That seems a bit odd because usually, when someone asks for the coefficient of a specific term, they might be looking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when we multiply the two expansions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first expansion, which is 6, times the sum of all terms from the second expansion. But that's not possible because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe it's actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. \n\nIf that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, then multiply them together. \n\nSo, first, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. \n\nNow, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. To find that, I can use the binomial theorem again. \n\nThe general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. \n\nNow, since the original expression is the product of the two expansions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is the product of the coefficients from each expansion, which is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but the problem just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not necessarily multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, if it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number. \n\nTherefore, I think the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, the answer would be 120. \n\nLet me double-check. \n\nFirst part: coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. \n\nSecond part: coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. \n\nMultiply them: 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nYes, that seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number, which is unlikely. \n\nTherefore, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nSo, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   We need the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   Setting the exponent equal to 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Hmm, let me break this down step by step. I think I should handle each part separately and then combine them. Let me start by expanding each bracket separately and see how it goes.\n\nFirst, let's look at \\((a + b)^4\\). I remember the binomial theorem, which says that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^k\\). So, applying that here, each term in the expansion will be \\(\\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\), right? So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would correspond to the term where \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, that term is \\(\\binom{4}{2} a^2 b^2\\). Let me compute \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\). That's 4! / (2! * (4 - 2)!) = (24) / (2 * 2) = 6. So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem here. Each term will be \\(\\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, it becomes \\(\\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m}\\) which is \\(\\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but wait, that term is in the first part. The second part is in terms of \\(c\\), so unless \\(c\\) is involved with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), I think the terms are independent. Wait, but in the original expression, it's a product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the variables are separate, so the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are multiplied by the \\(c\\) terms.\n\nWait a second, so when we multiply the two expansions together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), maybe the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion, but wait, that doesn't make sense because the second part is multiplied as a whole.\n\nWait, no, actually, the entire expression is the product of two polynomials. So, when you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term in the first part is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and in the second part, the terms are in \\(c\\), so when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be present in all those products, but each multiplied by a different power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion because each term in the second expansion is a constant (with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)) that gets multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the second expansion isn't a constant; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that seems odd because the entire expression is a product, so \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying any particular power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps it's considering all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) part. But that would mean that the coefficient is \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which would be \\(6 \\times (1 + 1)^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\), but that seems too high. Wait, maybe that's not the case.\n\nWait, no, I think I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when we multiply by the second part, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in the product with all the terms from the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think implies that we are to consider the coefficient regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, which is \\(6 \\times 2^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that seems too large. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the second part is a separate variable, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just 6, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, that can't be right because the product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) part. So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but let's test that. The sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems like a lot. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that each term in the product will have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) term. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, 6, because the second part is independent. Wait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). The product P(a, b) * Q(c) would have terms where each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in P is 6a^2b^2, and when multiplied by Q(c), which is a sum of terms like \\(\\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\), the resulting term would be 6a^2b^2 * sum_{m=0}^6 \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}. So, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of each term in Q(c), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But maybe I'm overcomplicating it because the problem might just be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the answer is 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so that would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm wrong. Let me try a different approach. Let's consider that the entire expression is a product of two independent polynomials, so when we multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second part. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion, which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term, not a coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero. That would make more sense. So, in that case, I need to find the term where in the second expansion, the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, and then multiply it by the coefficient from the first part.\n\nSo, in the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(6 = 2m\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the term is \\(\\binom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of the constant term in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), but perhaps considering only the constant term in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me make sure. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which has different powers of \\(c\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the entire second expansion. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), so the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at it differently. The problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k \\times \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\), as before, giving a coefficient of 6. Then, for each \\(m\\), the term will have \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) for each \\(c\\) term is 6 * \\(\\binom{6}{m}\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\binom{6}{m}\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\) = 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would be 6 multiplied by the entire second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Since the two parts are independent, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely confident.\n\nWait, but let me check with a smaller example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we have \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no \\(b^2\\) term multiplied by any term in \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, in \\((a + b)^2\\), the \\(b^2\\) term is 1*b^2, and in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\), the terms are c and 1/c. So, when you multiply, the \\(b^2\\) term would be multiplied by c and 1/c, giving \\(b^2c\\) and \\(b^2/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) in the entire product would be 1 * (1 + 1) = 2, but that's for \\(b^2c^0\\), but in this case, the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) would be 2 if we're considering all terms, but the problem might be asking for a specific power of \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe this is getting too confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut let me think again: in the product, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which has different powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384, because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient becomes 6 times that coefficient.\n\nWait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384, but that seems too large. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, so the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so I think the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm not entirely confident. Let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion is \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 1 * (c + 1/c), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) is also \\(c + 1/c\\). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is not a single number but a polynomial. But in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems odd because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting that we consider the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because if we consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. So, maybe the problem is expecting that answer. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 * 64 = 384, but that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's what is intended.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the problem differently. Since the two parts are independent, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part. But that's not correct because the product is a multiplication of two polynomials, so each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion, which would be 6 times the second expansion. But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\), is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. So, in the second expansion, the constant term is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the term is 20c^0. Therefore, when we multiply by the first part, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, giving \\(120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, we find the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. \n\nFirst, I know that when you have an expression raised to a power like \\((a + b)^4\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^{k}\\). So, applying that to \\((a + b)^4\\), it would expand to \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}ab^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}b^4\\). \n\nWait, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), right? Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\). \n\nNow, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider this part as well. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they are separate variables. Wait, but actually, the entire expression is multiplied together, so when I expand both parts, I might get terms that combine \\(a^2b^2\\) with various powers of \\(c\\). But the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps I just need to find the part of the expansion where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term (i.e., the term where the power of \\(c\\) cancels out, like \\(c^0\\)) in the second expansion. \n\nWait, is that correct? Because if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), that would give me \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something like that. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps I need to find the part where \\(c^0\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). That way, the term would just be \\(a^2b^2\\), and its coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from both expansions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. It says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so perhaps it's considering all possible terms in the expansion, and the coefficient would be a term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) times some combination of \\(c\\) terms. But that seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we can treat the entire expression as a product of two polynomials, and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. \n\nWait, but that's not quite right because \\(c\\) and \\(a\\), \\(b\\) are separate variables. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem might just be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, so maybe it's the part of the expansion where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) in the second expansion. \n\nLet me try to break it down step by step. \n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) as I did before. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. \n\nNext, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, this would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nSo, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the entire expression becomes a product of two sums. So, each term in the first sum is multiplied by each term in the second sum. \n\nBut I'm only interested in the terms where the product results in \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only present in the first factor, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and multiply it by any term from the second expansion. \n\nWait, but that would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, leading to terms like \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then perhaps we're considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and we need the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). \n\nBut that seems unlikely because the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", implying that it's considering \\(a^2b^2\\) as a term on its own, perhaps multiplied by some constant. But since \\(c\\) is involved, maybe the problem is expecting us to consider only the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). \n\nWait, let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two expansions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be a sum over all \\(k\\) of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\), but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would depend on \\(c\\). \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a constant. \n\nIf that's the case, then I need to find the term where in the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. \n\nSo, let's find the value of \\(k\\) such that \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\) so \\(k = 3\\). \n\nTherefore, the term in the second expansion where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is when \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). \n\nCalculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the term is \\(20c^0 = 20\\). \n\nNow, going back to the first expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. \n\nTherefore, when we multiply these two terms together, \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and \\(20\\) from the second, we get \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2 = 120a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the key idea is that to get the term \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and multiply it by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second expansion. \n\nYes, that makes sense because any other term from the second expansion would introduce a power of \\(c\\), which would make the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), where \\(k\\) is not zero. So, only when \\(k = 3\\) do we get \\(c^0\\), which allows the term to be just \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient is indeed 6 (from the first expansion) multiplied by 20 (from the second expansion), giving 120. \n\nI think that's correct. Let me double-check the calculations. \n\nFirst, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), that's correct. \n\nSecond, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), that's also correct. \n\nMultiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. \n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. It makes sense because each part is handled separately, and only the constant term from the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The expansion is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient for this term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each expansion:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Hmm, let's see. I think I can approach this by breaking it down into two parts: first, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) and then looking at \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to expand the entire expression. Instead, I can focus on the part involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and see how it interacts with the other part. \n\nFirst, let me consider \\((a + b)^4\\). I remember from the binomial theorem that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, for \\(n = 4\\), the expansion will have terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\). Specifically, the term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) would be when \\(k = 2\\), right? So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\binom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I also think about using the binomial theorem here. The expansion will be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, each term is \\(\\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is part of the first expansion, and we're multiplying this by the second expansion, I think we need to consider how these two parts combine.\n\nWait, but actually, since the two expansions are multiplied together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will multiply each term in the second expansion. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the overall product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, does the problem want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), or is there a specific power of \\(c\\) we're looking for? Hmm, the problem just says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe we just need to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, multiplied by the entire second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the second expansion isn't being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) directly.\n\nWait, no, actually, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these out, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, which are powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, so does that mean we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), or specifically when multiplied by a certain power of \\(c\\)? Wait, the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so I think it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be the same as the coefficient in the first part times the entire second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the second expansion has multiple terms.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion, but that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to the second expansion itself, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, if I expand both parts separately, the first part will have terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), \\(b^4\\), and the second part will have terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will multiply each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will multiply each term from the second part, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). Wait, but that's not a single term; it's multiple terms. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean we're looking for all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, each multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), and the coefficients would be the sum of the products of the coefficients from each part.\n\nBut that seems a bit odd because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by a specific power of \\(c\\), but the problem doesn't specify that. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the products where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a number.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't seem right because usually, when you're asked for a coefficient, it's a specific term. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and ignoring the second part. But that seems too simplistic because the second part is being multiplied.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so we need to consider how the two expansions interact. But in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by each term from the second part. But that would make the coefficient a sum of terms involving powers of \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because a coefficient is a number, not a polynomial.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it doesn't specify. Hmm, maybe I need to re-express the problem differently. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, which are in terms of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because coefficients are scalars.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try another approach. Perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, we can treat the \\(c\\) part as a separate variable and just focus on the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts. But that doesn't seem right because the \\(c\\) terms are part of the product.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would require considering all possible combinations where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a sum over all possible terms, which is not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is miswritten, or maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let me try to clarify. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\binom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\binom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\binom{4}{k}\\binom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, we're interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need to find all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, which would correspond to \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), which gives us the coefficient \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\) from the first part. Now, this term will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, which is \\(\\binom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\binom{6}{m}\\). Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is a sum of terms involving \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\), which again seems like it's a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, meaning \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). That would make the term \\(a^2b^2c^0 = a^2b^2\\). So, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the product of the coefficients from both expansions when the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out.\n\nIf that's the case, then we can proceed as follows:\n\nFrom the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nFrom the second part, the term where \\(c^0\\) is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient for that term is \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\); it just said \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I'm making an assumption here. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean we're looking for all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, each multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), and the coefficient would be a polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because coefficients are numbers, not polynomials.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would indeed be a polynomial. But that seems unusual because the problem didn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\).\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. Perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, and since the second part is multiplied by the first, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which is not a number. So, that can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), meaning that we're just looking for the coefficient in the first part, which is 6. But that seems too simple because the second part is being multiplied.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be the sum of all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because coefficients are scalars.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^4\\), but that's just a guess. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120 as I calculated earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the product of the coefficients from each part, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is a sum, not a single term.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial. But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number.\n\nWait, maybe I should just proceed under the assumption that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is a distraction. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts.\n\nWait, let me try to think differently. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in the product will be of the form \\(\\binom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\binom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would occur when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient from the first part is 6. Then, for each \\(m\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(\\binom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\right)\\). But that's a polynomial, not a single number.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's referring to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 times 20, which is 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients from the second part multiplied by 6. But that would be 6 times (1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6 times 64 = 384, which seems too large.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is a separate consideration. But that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, but that would be 6 times 2^6 = 6 times 64 = 384, which seems too high.\n\nWait, but the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has a sum of coefficients when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, if we substitute \\(c = 1\\), the second part becomes 64. Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times 64 = 384. But that seems like a possible approach.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's the correct way to approach it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial. But the problem didn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so perhaps the intended answer is 6, the coefficient from the first part, and the second part is a separate consideration.\n\nWait, but that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would require considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), and the coefficient would be a polynomial. But since the problem didn't specify, I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the product of the coefficients from each part when the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero. So, as I thought earlier, the term where \\(c^0\\) is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient from the second part is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\). Then, the coefficient from the first part is 6, so the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the problem is likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Therefore, the answer is 120.\n\nWait, let me confirm that approach. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be combined with any term from the second expansion. However, if we're specifically looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, then we need to find the term in the second expansion where \\(c^0\\), which is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient for that term is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is 6, so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering the \\(c^0\\) term, is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\binom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We are interested in the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\binom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient from the second part is 20.\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

But wait, the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so maybe those terms don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, maybe I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then consider how the second part might influence it. Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is the product of two binomials, so maybe I need to consider both expansions together. But wait, the terms in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so perhaps the coefficients in the second part don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So maybe I can just find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that might not be correct. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are different variables, the product will have terms that are products of terms from each expansion. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes only from the first part, and the second part's terms will be multiplied by \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that might not be right because each term in the second expansion has different powers of \\(c\\), so when we multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, leading to terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the problem just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps we can ignore the \\(c\\) terms and just take the coefficient from the first part. Wait, but that seems too simplistic. Alternatively, maybe I need to consider that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So first, let me find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\).\n\nUsing the binomial theorem, \\((a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^4 \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs is when \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. So the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the sum of all coefficients in this expansion. Wait, but the sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So if I substitute \\(c = 1\\), the expression becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients from the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if this is correct. Because when we multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, the specific term is \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So perhaps each term in the first expansion (which is \\(a^2b^2\\)) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) power. So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nBut wait, let me verify this. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and when expanding, each term is of the form \\(\\binom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\binom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\binom{4}{k}\\binom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we are looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as before, so \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient from the first part is 6. Then, for each such term, it's multiplied by \\(\\binom{6}{m}\\) times \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\binom{6}{m}\\), because each \\(m\\) contributes a term that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives a term with different \\(c\\) powers, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself is the sum of all these contributions. So, the sum of \\(\\binom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it: since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part contributes a coefficient that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So yes, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if this is correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider only the constant term in the second expansion, but no, the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\). It just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So I think my approach is correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanding, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion with coefficient 6, and it's multiplied by every term from the second expansion. Each term from the second expansion has a coefficient, so the total contribution to \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that seems right. So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " Hmm, that seems a bit involved, but let me break it down step by step. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that when you expand a binomial like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can use the binomial theorem, which states that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, maybe I can apply this theorem to both parts of the expression, \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then see how they interact.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), right? So maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are separate from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Hmm, but wait, actually, the entire expression is the product of two expansions. So, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are multiplied by the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I might not need to consider the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). Or do I?\n\nWait, no, actually, the entire expression is the product of two polynomials, so each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we only need the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that have \\(c^0\\), because when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would give a term that's purely \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps I need to find the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\).\n\nThat makes sense. So, first, let me find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). So, when \\(k = 2\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2} b^{2}\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. So, that's straightforward.\n\nNext, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20.\n\nSo, the constant term is 20. Now, since the original expression is the product of the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we only care about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we only need the constant term from the second expansion because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) component, which we don't want. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the constant term from the second part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. So, in the first expansion, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs at \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when we multiply these two, we get 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about the entire product. Each term in the product is a term from the first expansion multiplied by a term from the second expansion. So, to get a term that's purely \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by the constant term from the second part. That makes sense because any other term from the second part would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) component, which would make the term not purely \\(a^2b^2\\). So, indeed, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but is there any other way this could happen? For instance, could there be a scenario where taking a different term from the first expansion and a different term from the second expansion could result in \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied together? Let me think. For example, if I took \\(a^3b\\) from the first expansion and multiplied it by a term from the second expansion that has \\(1/a\\), but wait, the second expansion doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's only in terms of \\(c\\). So, no, the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and multiplying it by the constant term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nSo, to recap, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, and multiplying these together gives 120. Therefore, the coefficient we're looking for is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts: the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   We need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which occurs when \\(k = 2\\).

Because each term in the second expansion contributes its own coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nBut wait, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So that's 64. So the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times 64.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should just consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first part, the second part's coefficients just multiply the entire term. So maybe the total coefficient is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let's think about it: when you multiply two expressions, say \\( (P(a,b)) \\times (Q(c)) \\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a,b)\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\), because every term in \\(Q(c)\\) gets multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total contribution to the coefficient is the coefficient in \\(P(a,b)\\) times the sum of coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\).\n\nSo, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^4 \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs is when \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNext, find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I thought earlier, this is equal to evaluating the expression at \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times\\) sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6\u00d764=384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two expansions, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part, but since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's just the product of the coefficients. So yeah, 6\u00d764=384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Let me consider a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be \\(\\binom{2}{2}=1\\) times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\), which is 2. So the coefficient would be 1\u00d72=2. But if I expand it, it's \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) is \\(a^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), so the coefficient is 1\u00d7(c + 1/c), but if I'm just considering the coefficient as a number, it's 1\u00d72=2, which matches. So that seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the given problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6\u00d764=384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of the entire expansion and consider that each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from one specific term in the first expansion, and then all terms from the second expansion. So the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Let me compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^6 \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The sum of all coefficients is when \\(c=1\\), which is \\(2^6=64\\). So when I multiply the two, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6\u00d764=384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part. So the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6\u00d764=384.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me just compute the two parts separately and then multiply.\n\nFirst, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\binom{4}{2}=6\\).\n\nNext, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c=1\\), which gives \\(2^6=64\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure that this approach is correct. Because in the product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the other polynomial. So yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to expand the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the first part, and each term from the second part would multiply it, contributing their coefficients. So the total coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64.\n\nTherefore, I think the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with another approach. Let me compute the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and see what the sum of coefficients is.\n\nExpanding \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^6 \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^6 \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo the coefficients are:\n\n- For \\(k=0\\): \\(\\binom{6}{0}=1\\), term is \\(c^6\\)\n- \\(k=1\\): \\(\\binom{6}{1}=6\\), term is \\(6c^4\\)\n- \\(k=2\\): \\(\\binom{6}{2}=15\\), term is \\(15c^2\\)\n- \\(k=3\\): \\(\\binom{6}{3}=20\\), term is \\(20c^0=20\\)\n- \\(k=4\\): \\(\\binom{6}{4}=15\\), term is \\(15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(k=5\\): \\(\\binom{6}{5}=6\\), term is \\(6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(k=6\\): \\(\\binom{6}{6}=1\\), term is \\(c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo the sum of coefficients is \\(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64\\), which confirms the earlier result.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me consider the entire product. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it adds to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the total coefficient is the sum of all those products, which is \\(6 \\times (1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1)\\) = \\(6 \\times 64\\) = 384.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I should look at each part separately. The expression is a product of two binomials raised to powers: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since multiplication distributes over addition, maybe I can expand each part separately and then see how they combine.\n\nStarting with \\((a + b)^4\\). I remember the binomial theorem, which says that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^k\\). So applying this to \\((a + b)^4\\), each term will be \\(\\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\).\n\nI specifically need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So in this expansion, \\(a^{4 - k} b^k\\) becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) when \\(4 - k = 2\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). So the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\binom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, each term will be \\(\\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking about \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So does that mean I can treat these two parts independently? Because the first part is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\). So when I multiply them together, the terms from each expansion will multiply term by term.\n\nSo, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), I only need the term from \\((a + b)^4\\) that has \\(a^2b^2\\), which we found has a coefficient of 6. Then, I need to consider how this term interacts with the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), it will multiply every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me think. If I have \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then every term in the second expansion will be multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), I think that's correct. So the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term in the first expansion, and when multiplied by the entire second expansion, it will contribute \\(6a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's just 6, because the other part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, but that seems too simple.\n\nWait, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So if I have \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the entire second expansion, then each term in the second expansion will be multiplied by 6a^2b^2. So, the coefficient for each term involving \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient from the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So maybe I need to sum all the coefficients from the second expansion and multiply by 6.\n\nBut wait, that's not quite right because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because when you distribute \\(6a^2b^2\\) over the second expansion, each term in the second expansion will have a coefficient, and when multiplied by 6a^2b^2, it becomes 6 times that coefficient times \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on \\(c\\), I think that the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but actually, no. Because the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in this expansion would be when we set \\(c = 1\\). So if I substitute \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term has a coefficient. So the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times each \\(c^k\\) term is 6 times the coefficient of each \\(c^k\\) term. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's actually the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So yes, 6 times 64 is 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and when multiplied by the entire second expansion, it's like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, so 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because in the product, each term is a combination of \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). So if I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then I need to sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms. That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of \\(c\\), so it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me think if there's another way. Maybe I should consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since the first polynomial has \\(a^2b^2\\) and the second has various \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, so the total coefficient is 6*(sum of coefficients in the second expansion).\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with a different approach. Let's expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. Each term is \\(\\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} (1/c)^m = \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So the coefficients are \\(\\binom{6}{m}\\) for each \\(m\\) from 0 to 6. So the sum of all coefficients is when \\(c=1\\), which is indeed \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6*64=384. Therefore, the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because I might be missing something. Let me try another way. Suppose I consider the entire expression:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\left(\\sum_{k=0}^4 \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\right) \\left(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\right)\n\\]\n\nNow, when I multiply these two sums, each term will be \\(\\binom{4}{k} \\binom{6}{m} a^{4 - k} b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nI'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which requires \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, for \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(k=2\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\binom{6}{m}\\). Because \\(b^2\\) is fixed, and the \\(c\\) terms can be anything. So, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\binom{6}{m}\\).\n\nCalculating that: \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\) and \\(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\binom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\). So, 6*64=384. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I'm only considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\), then it's multiplied by the entire second expansion, so the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nYes, I think that's the right approach. So the coefficient is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts and use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   We need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which occurs when \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Considering the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives:\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results**:\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient from the first expansion and the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when dealing with expansions, the binomial theorem is really useful. But wait, the expression has two parts multiplied together: one involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since the terms \\(a^2b^2\\) and the terms involving \\(c\\) are separate, maybe I can handle each part separately and then combine them.\n\nFirst, let me consider the \\((a + b)^4\\) part. Using the binomial theorem, I know that the expansion of \\((a + b)^n\\) is the sum from \\(k=0\\) to \\(n\\) of \\(\\dbinom{n}{k}a^{k}b^{n - k}\\). So for \\(n = 4\\), the expansion will have terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\). But I'm specifically interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So I need to find the term where the power of \\(a\\) is 2 and the power of \\(b\\) is 2.\n\nUsing the binomial coefficient formula, the term for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be when \\(k = 2\\). So the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So the coefficient from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part is 6.\n\nNow, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider how this part interacts with the first part. Wait, but in the original problem, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term? Hmm, let me think. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Or does it? Wait, no, because the entire expression is the product of both expansions, so each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider how it interacts with the second part.\n\nWait, but actually, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all, so when I multiply it by the second expansion, which involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe it's considering the entire product, so the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire sum of coefficients from the second part. Wait, no, that can't be right because each term in the product is a combination of terms from both expansions. So perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, that might be the case.\n\nWait, let me clarify. Let's denote the first part as \\(P = (a + b)^4\\) and the second part as \\(Q = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So the entire expression is \\(P \\times Q\\). When we multiply these two, each term in \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\). So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(Q\\), which are terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear multiplied by each term from \\(Q\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So that would mean that the coefficient is the coefficient from \\(P\\) (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from \\(Q\\). Because each term in \\(Q\\) contributes a factor when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So let me compute \\(Q\\) when \\(c = 1\\): \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So the sum of the coefficients in \\(Q\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\(P \\times Q\\) would be 6 (from \\(P\\)) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients in \\(Q\\)), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product equal to the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) and the sum of coefficients in \\(Q\\)? Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(Q\\), each term in \\(Q\\) is of the form \\(c^k \\times (1/c)^{6 - k}\\), which is \\(c^{2k - 6}\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), when we multiply it by each term in \\(Q\\), each resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^{2k - 6}\\). So in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in every term of the form \\(a^2b^2c^{2k - 6}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the sum of all the coefficients from \\(Q\\), each multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\(P\\). So that would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(Q\\), which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. So I think that's the correct approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) is 6, and since \\(Q\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), when you multiply \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\), which is 64, so 384.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should approach it differently. Let me consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. So in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the product of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) and any term in \\(Q\\), because \\(Q\\) doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\). So that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check that. Let's take a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1)^1\\). The expansion of \\((a + b)^2\\) is \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and the expansion of \\((c + 1)\\) is \\(c + 1\\). So when I multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be 1 (from \\(a^2\\)) times (1 + 1) = 2, so the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product is 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2 times 2 = 4, and so on. So yes, in that case, the coefficient of a specific term in the first polynomial is multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. So that seems to confirm my approach.\n\nTherefore, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) is 6, and the sum of coefficients in \\(Q\\) is 64, so the coefficient in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. Is there any interaction between the variables \\(a, b\\) and \\(c, 1/c\\) that could affect the coefficient? For example, does the term \\(a^2b^2\\) get multiplied by \\(c^k\\) terms, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's effectively the sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms. So yes, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(Q\\), which is 64, so 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the constant term in \\(Q\\), but that doesn't make sense because \\(Q\\) is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded has terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\). So the constant term would be when the exponent is 0. Let me compute that.\n\nThe general term in \\(Q\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{k} \\left(1/c\\right)^{6 - k} = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{2k - 6}\\). So the exponent is \\(2k - 6\\). To find the constant term, set \\(2k - 6 = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would be 6 * 20 = 120. But in our problem, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any \\(c\\) terms. So I think that means we have to consider all possible \\(c\\) terms, which would mean the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and when it asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's considering the entire product, so each term in the product would have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents and \\(c\\) exponents. So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would include all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). So in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\), which is 64, so 384.\n\nWait, but let me check this again. Let's say I have \\(P = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(Q = (c + 1/c)^6\\). The product is \\(P \\times Q\\). Each term in \\(P\\) is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{k}b^{4 - k}\\), and each term in \\(Q\\) is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{m}(1/c)^{6 - m} = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{2m - 6}\\).\n\nSo when I multiply \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\), a general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{k}b^{4 - k}c^{2m - 6}\\). Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So I need to find all terms where \\(k = 2\\) and \\(4 - k = 2\\), which is consistent. So for each \\(m\\) from 0 to 6, the term \\(a^2b^2c^{2m - 6}\\) will have a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum over \\(m\\) from 0 to 6 of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\).\n\nWait, but that's exactly what I thought earlier: the sum over \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\), so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we would have to set \\(2m - 6 = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 * 20 = 120\\). But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's 384.\n\nSo, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let's compute \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) again: 4! / (2!2!) = (24)/(2*2) = 6. Correct. The sum of coefficients in \\(Q\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Correct. So 6 * 64 is indeed 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include all possible exponents of \\(c\\). So, yes, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\), which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but perhaps another approach is to expand both expressions and see, but that would be time-consuming. Alternatively, think of it as the product of two polynomials, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) and the sum of coefficients in \\(Q\\).\n\nI think that makes sense. So, I'm confident that the coefficient is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts and handle each part separately.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^k b^{4-k}\n   \\]\n   We are interested in the term where the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2.

    "text": " Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. \n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression raised to a power, like \\((a + b)^4\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), each term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4.\n\nSince I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That means I need to solve for \\(k\\) in the equation \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), which gives \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). \n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nNow, looking at the other part of the expression, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder if this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so when we multiply the two expressions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\). That means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression should just be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), right? Because when you multiply by another expression, unless there are overlapping variables, the coefficients don't change. \n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't affect the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would just come from the product of the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but wait, that might not be right. \n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials together, the coefficients multiply. But in this case, we're dealing with separate variables, so each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) by any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, is that correct? Because when you have separate variables, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), meaning that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut hold on, that might not be the case. Let me clarify: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply together to give that specific term. \n\nIn this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(c\\) is a different variable, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because when you multiply by another polynomial, the coefficients don't just multiply by the sum. Let me think again. \n\nActually, no, that's not correct. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself isn't affected by the \\(c\\) terms because there's no way to combine \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) to get a constant term (unless \\(k = 0\\), but that's just 1). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the constant term. \n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because to get \\(a^2b^2\\), you need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the term that has \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, first, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found to be 6. \n\nNext, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that using the binomial theorem as well. \n\nThe expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we solve \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). That gives \\(k = 3\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. \n\nNow, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, we multiply the two coefficients: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). \n\nSo, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when you multiply these together, you get 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the coefficient is 120. \n\nI think that's the answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. \n\nWe have two separate parts: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will only come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part by the constant term in the second part. The constant term in the second part is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nYes, that makes sense. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations. The binomial coefficients are correct, and the reasoning about how the variables don't interfere with each other seems solid. \n\nSo, I think the coefficient is indeed 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). \n\nNext, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 occurs when \\(k = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nMultiplying these coefficients together: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

So, I can apply this theorem to both \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) separately. \n\nBut wait, the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term is part of the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), so maybe I don't need to worry about the other part involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). Hmm, is that right? Let me make sure.\n\nSo, the entire expression is the product of two binomial expansions: one in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) in it, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be the coefficient from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a constant with respect to \\(c\\)) from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think again. Because when you multiply two expansions together, every term in the first expansion gets multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, if I'm looking for a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would mean I need to find terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is the constant term, which is the middle term when the exponent is even. Since 6 is even, the middle term is when \\(k = 3\\), so the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{3} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{3}\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\), so that's 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient from the second part is 20. Now, I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). \n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\). The term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs is when \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of these two coefficients: 6 (from the first expansion) multiplied by 20 (from the second expansion). \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Hmm, that seems correct. Let me verify each step again.\n\nFirst, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(k = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but hold on a second. Is it correct to just take the constant term from the second expansion? Because when you multiply the two expansions, every term from the first is multiplied by every term from the second. So, if I'm looking for a term that doesn't have any \\(c\\) in it, that would be the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term and the constant term from the second expansion. So, yes, that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, if I were looking for a term that does have some power of \\(c\\), I would have to consider cross terms, but in this case, since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get that term in the product is by multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion by \\(c^0\\) from the second expansion. \n\nTherefore, I think my reasoning is correct. The coefficient is 120. \n\nBut let me just think about whether there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe by considering the entire expansion? Although that might be more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the two expansions separately and then see how they interact.\n\nWait, another thought: the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), their coefficients don't interfere with the \\(c\\) terms. So, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if we take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first factor and the constant term from the second factor.

The expression is a product of two binomials each raised to a power: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since these are multiplied together, any term in the expansion will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. \n\nBut wait, the question is specifically asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).

So the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I also need to expand this using the binomial theorem. Let me denote \\(x = c\\) and \\(y = \\dfrac{1}{c}\\), so the expansion becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\).\n\nSimplifying each term, \\(\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = c^{-k}\\), so each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nI need to find the coefficient of a specific term here, but wait, the original problem is about \\(a^2b^2\\). Since this part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), it doesn't directly affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So when I multiply the two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. \n\nBut since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that means we only care about the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a constant with respect to \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion's sum. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is multiplied by the first, so each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, when multiplied by the second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient times \\(c^{\\text{something}}\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), I think we have to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, each contributing their own coefficient.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't sound right. Because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so each of those would be separate terms. So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the same as the coefficient in the first part, because each term in the second expansion just adds another factor, but the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by all of them. But that seems contradictory because the problem is asking for a single coefficient, so maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So that would mean that the coefficient is the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the entire second expansion, you're effectively scaling \\(a^2b^2\\) by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nLet me check that logic. If I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6 \\), then each term in the expansion of the first part is multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part. So the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these, you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So each of these is a separate term, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) alone, without considering \\(c\\), would be zero because there's no term without \\(c\\). Wait, but that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient, so maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the other variables, so the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term is \\(a^2b^2\\) times something with \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) and ignoring the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So for the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), plugging in \\(c = 1\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So the sum of the coefficients is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then in the entire product, every term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) will have the coefficient 6 times the coefficient from the second expansion. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's just 6, because the other part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term is multiplied by every term, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms. So in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first expansion, and it's multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6 \\), then the expansion is a product of two independent polynomials. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and when multiplied by the entire second part, it becomes 6*(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6). So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6*(1) because the constant term in the second expansion is 20. Wait, no, because in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6*1, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 6*6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^2\\) is 6*15, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (with no c) is 6*20, and so on.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of c. So in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, so the coefficient is 6*20 = 120.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the second expansion, the only term that results in \\(a^2b^2\\) without any c terms is when you multiply by the constant term in the second expansion. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is when the exponent of c is zero. So in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(c^{6 - 2k} = c^0\\) is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. So the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the constant term in the second part, which is 20. So 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me verify:\n\nFirst part: \\((a + b)^4\\), coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nSecond part: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(c^0\\), which is when \\(k = 3\\), so coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some k, then we would have to consider the corresponding term in the second expansion. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of c, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's the correct approach. So the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   The general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\). For \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nMultiplying the coefficients from each part gives the final coefficient: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Hmm, let's break this down. I think I should tackle each part separately and then see how they combine. \n\nFirst, let's look at \\((a + b)^4\\). I remember that when expanding a binomial like this, the coefficients can be found using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^k\\). So, applying that here, \\((a + b)^4\\) will have terms like \\(\\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\) for \\(k\\) from 0 to 4.\n\nSince we're interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that corresponds to the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. So, let's set up the exponents: \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), which means \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). So, the coefficient here is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\binom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder if this part will affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), right? So, when we multiply the two expressions together, the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with \\(c\\). That means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, does that make sense? Because when we multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. But in this case, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the \\(c\\) terms won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) should just be 6 times whatever the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is, but since we're only looking for the coefficient, and the variables are separate, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest is about the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, so maybe I need to consider how the two expansions interact. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider that in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6, as I found earlier. Then, when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the variables are separate. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you have two separate variables, the product of the two expressions will have terms where each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second. But since we're looking for a specific term \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way that term can come about is if we take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expression and multiply it by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second expression. Because if we take any other term from the second expression, it would involve \\(c\\) raised to some power, which would make the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something like that, which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the only contribution to \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, that means I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Once I have that, I can multiply it by 6 to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product.\n\nOkay, so let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\binom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 * 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and when multiplied by the constant term 20 from the other expansion, gives 120. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and when expanding, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and multiplying it by the term in the second expansion that doesn't have \\(c\\), which is the constant term. So, yes, that makes sense.\n\nI think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero:\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\nThe constant term is:\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I'm a bit confused because there are two parts to this expression: one involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). I think I can handle each part separately and then multiply them together, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, let's consider the part with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\): \\((a + b)^4\\). I remember that when expanding a binomial like \\((x + y)^n\\), we can use the binomial theorem, which states that the expansion is the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(n\\) of \\(\\dbinom{n}{k}x^{n - k}y^{k}\\). So, applying that here, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) would be the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\). \n\nI'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to find the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. So, let me set up the exponents: \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\) and \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). Solving \\(4 - k = 2\\), I get \\(k = 2\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^{2}b^{2}\\). \n\nNow, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is the binomial coefficient, which is calculated as \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!(4 - 2)!}\\). Let me compute that: \\(4! = 24\\), \\(2! = 2\\), so it becomes \\(\\dfrac{24}{2 \\times 2} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nAlright, that's the first part. Now, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider how this part interacts with the first part. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The other part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables. So, maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, that might be the case. Let me think.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find all the terms in the expansion where the product results in \\(a^2b^2\\). But since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expression would introduce \\(c\\) terms. But the original problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient is just 6, regardless of the other part?\n\nWait, no, that can't be right. Because when you multiply the two expressions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since the second part is a separate variable, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not an expression.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of the two expressions. That means that \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the expansion of the product. But since the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term from the second expression. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\).\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, when you expand the entire expression, how many times does \\(a^2b^2\\) appear, considering all possible terms from the second expression. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which would result in a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, not an expression. So, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) as separate variables, and we're supposed to find the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. Because in the second expression, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term that has \\(c^0\\) would be the constant term, which is the middle term when expanded. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the constant term of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nThat makes sense. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6. So, let's work on that.\n\nFirst, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, the expansion is the sum from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(1/c\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero for the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\): \\(6! = 720\\), \\(3! = 6\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the coefficient from the first part is 6, and the constant term from the second part is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the entire expansion, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion.

    "text": " Hmm, let me break this down step by step. I'm a bit confused because there are two parts to this expression: one involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But wait, the term we're interested in is \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So maybe the \\(c\\) part doesn't affect this term? Or does it? Hmm, maybe I should consider both parts together, but perhaps the \\(c\\) terms won't interact with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms when expanding. Let me think.\n\nFirst, let's consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). I remember that the binomial theorem can be used here. The binomial theorem states that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^k\\). So, applying this to \\((a + b)^4\\), each term will be \\(\\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. So, that part is straightforward.\n\nNow, the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to figure out how this interacts with the first part. Since we're multiplying two expressions together, the entire expansion will be the product of the expansions of each part. So, every term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the term we're interested in is \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which means I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficients in the product will be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again.\n\nActually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), like \\(a^2b^2\\), then in the product, that term would come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term involving \\(c\\), then the result will have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something like that, which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to get a term that's exactly \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the term in the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term.\n\nSo, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well.\n\nThe expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will have terms of the form \\(\\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\), which simplifies to \\(\\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\), which is 20.\n\nTherefore, the constant term in the second expansion is 20. So, when we multiply the two expansions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), gives me 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), gives me 20 as the constant term. So, when I multiply these two expansions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we only want the term where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\), we have to pick the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and the constant term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut wait, is that the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. Suppose I have other terms in the second expansion, but they involve \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). If I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\) or \\(1/c^k\\), the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the only way to get a pure \\(a^2b^2\\) term is to multiply by the constant term in the second expansion. So, yeah, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Maybe I should consider if there's a way to have \\(c\\) terms that cancel out, but no, because \\(c\\) and \\(a\\), \\(b\\) are different variables. So, unless \\(c\\) is expressed in terms of \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), which it isn't, the \\(c\\) terms can't interact with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion by the constant term from the second expansion. So, yeah, 120 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product, and when expanding, the coefficients multiply. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, so their product is 120, which would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. That makes sense.\n\nWait, let me check if I calculated the binomial coefficients correctly. For the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\). Let's compute that: \\(\\binom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). Correct.\n\nFor the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Then, \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\). Correct.\n\nSo, 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, maybe I should write out the expansions a bit more to see if I'm missing something. Let's see:\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, yeah, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nSecond, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, the terms are:\n\n- \\(k=0\\): \\(\\binom{6}{0}c^6 = 1 \\cdot c^6\\)\n\n- \\(k=1\\): \\(\\binom{6}{1}c^{4} = 6c^4\\)\n\n- \\(k=2\\): \\(\\binom{6}{2}c^{2} = 15c^2\\)\n\n- \\(k=3\\): \\(\\binom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\)\n\n- \\(k=4\\): \\(\\binom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n\n- \\(k=5\\): \\(\\binom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n\n- \\(k=6\\): \\(\\binom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the constant term is indeed 20.\n\nTherefore, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from multiplying 6a^2b^2 by 20, giving 120a^2b^2. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the answer should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results**:\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

I'm a bit confused because there are two parts to this expression: one involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I can handle each part separately and then combine them somehow. \n\nFirst, let me focus on the \\((a + b)^4\\) part. I remember that when you expand a binomial like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can use the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, in this case, \\(n = 4\\). \n\nI need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. So, let's see: when \\(a^{2}\\) and \\(b^{2}\\), then \\(n - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, substituting into the binomial coefficient, that would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6.\n\nNow, what about the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? I'm not directly looking for a term involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), but I think I need to consider how this part interacts with the first part. Wait, maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms at all because the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So perhaps the \\(c\\) terms just multiply the entire expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), but since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms would just contribute a constant factor, right?\n\nWait, but that might not be the case. Let me think again. If I have two separate expressions multiplied together, like \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then when I expand them, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part would be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps I can consider the coefficient as 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. But wait, that doesn't make sense because each term in the second part is a power of \\(c\\), so they're not constants.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When I expand both, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. But wait, the second part isn't just a sum of constants; it's a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when I multiply out the two expansions, every term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or something like that. But since the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider the coefficient as 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficients from the second expansion just contribute a factor that gets multiplied by 6.\n\nWait, that might make sense. So, if I let \\(S\\) be the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times \\(S\\). But how do I find \\(S\\), the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)?\n\nI remember that the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients from the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) terms, that can't be right because the entire product will have terms involving \\(c\\). Wait, no, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, we're looking for all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponents of \\(c\\) can be anything. So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach it differently. Let's consider that \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) are multiplied together, so when we expand the entire expression, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{2}b^{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{n}\\), where \\(k\\) and \\(m\\) are appropriate indices. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum over all terms in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384, as before.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion really 64? Because when you set \\(c = 1\\), you get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), yes. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the entire second expansion is multiplied by that. But since the second expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Let me try expanding the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), using the binomial theorem. The expansion would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply this by \\((a + b)^4\\), which has the term \\(6a^2b^2\\), the product will have terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), because each term contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\), as we found earlier. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me compute \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). That's the sum of binomial coefficients for \\(n = 6\\), which is indeed \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand it, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from the first part times the entire second part, because each term in the second part is multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, that seems consistent. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts and then combine the results.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   We need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Considering the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion can be found by substituting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n   This means the sum of all coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64.\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."
