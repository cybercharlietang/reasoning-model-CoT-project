    "text": " So, the coefficient from the second part is 20. Now, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Let me double-check the steps. First, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(c\\) cancels out (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) occurs when the exponent from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are equal. So, in the expansion, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\cdot (1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Setting \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) gives \\(m = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, that's correct. Then, multiplying 6 * 20 gives 120. So, I think that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. The problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand this, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion and the constant term in the second expansion. So, yes, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. I don't think I made a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire product, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and \\(c^0\\) from the second part. So, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nWait another thing: sometimes when you have multiple variables, you might have cross terms, but in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and the constant term from the second part. So, yeah, 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's correct.\n\nSo, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiply them together, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nI don't think I missed anything here.

    "text": " So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, combining both parts: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when we multiply these two parts together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanding, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part can only be multiplied by the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) from the second part, which is the \\(c^0\\) term. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but let me just check if I did the binomial coefficients correctly. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), which is correct. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent is 0 is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), which is correct. So, 6 * 20 is indeed 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure that I'm not supposed to consider other terms. For example, could there be a term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) gives another term, but the coefficient is still 120? No, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a separate variable from \\(c\\), so any term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) would result in a term that includes \\(c\\), which isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the only contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) with the constant term in the second polynomial. So, yes, 120 is the correct coefficient.\n\nWait, but just to double-check, let me think about the entire expansion. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the first expansion, and the term \\(c^0\\) is part of the second expansion. So, when you multiply them together, you get \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0 = a^2b^2\\), which is the term we're interested in. The coefficient is 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), which is 120. So, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to write out the entire expansion, but that would be time-consuming. But perhaps I can consider a simpler case to test my reasoning. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\(a c + a (1/c) + b c + b (1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^1\\) is 1, and the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^0\\) is 0 because there's no such term. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1c^1\\) is 1, and so on. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^0\\) is 0, which makes sense because there's no term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are such that their sum is 1, and the exponents of \\(c\\) sum to 0. But in our problem, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, so their sum is 4, and in the second polynomial, the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which is possible as we found. So, our approach seems correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial by the \\(c^0\\) term from the second polynomial. There are no other combinations because any term from the second polynomial would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) term, which would change the term we're looking at. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me just check if I considered all possible terms. Suppose I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and \\(c^k\\) from the second part, but since we're only interested in the term without \\(c\\), \\(k\\) must be 0. So, yes, only the \\(c^0\\) term contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.
