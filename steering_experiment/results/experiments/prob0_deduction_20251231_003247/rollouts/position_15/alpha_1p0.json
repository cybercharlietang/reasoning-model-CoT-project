    "text": " So, the overall expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, is that right? Let me think. When I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is from \\((a + b)^4\\), when I multiply it by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it will just add the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, if I have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) and I multiply it by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each of those will contribute to different terms in the final product. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), maybe I need to consider all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that seems a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term will have a coefficient multiplied by the corresponding term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), we need to find the part of the expansion where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because only then will the resulting term have no \\(c\\) component, so it will just be a constant multiple of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that means I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we found to be 6. So, let's work on finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We need to find the value of \\(m\\) such that \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 - 2m = 0 \\Rightarrow 2m = 6 \\Rightarrow m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) will have \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) for the constant term. So, that's \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, let me double-check my reasoning. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. Then, when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), to get a term without \\(c\\), we need to multiply by the constant term in that expansion, which is 20. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, if I think about the entire expansion, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by all the terms in the second expansion, but only the constant term will result in a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

But since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I might not need to consider the \\(c\\) terms unless they affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. Wait, no, actually, the \\(c\\) terms are separate variables, so when I multiply the two expansions together, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms will only come from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the \\(c\\) terms will come from the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms at all? Or do I? Hmm, let me think. Wait, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. But in this case, since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would mean I need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because \\(c^0 = 1\\), and that would be the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\).

First, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do this, I can use the binomial theorem again. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). I need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(m = 3\\) will have \\(c^0\\), and its coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expression is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, since we're multiplying the two expressions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by \\(c^0\\) (which is 1) from the second part, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\)). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. Wait, let me just make sure I didn't miss anything. I considered the binomial expansions for both parts, found the coefficients for the specific terms, and then multiplied them together.

That means I need to consider the product of the terms from each expansion. However, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second part, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). So, when I multiply the two expansions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). That suggests that maybe I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms at all because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) in it. Wait, that might not be the case. Let me think again. Actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and I multiply it by any term from the second part, the resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking only for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would imply that we're looking for the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out, so that the term is just a constant multiple of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in other words, we need the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is a constant term, because when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it will give a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant. Alternatively, if the term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is not constant, then when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it will result in a term that has \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something like that, which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\) by itself. So, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if it's multiplied by 1 (i.e., a constant term) from the second part. Therefore, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, which is 6. So, let's work on finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, we can write this as \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m}\\) which is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0 because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. When we multiply these two parts together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, when I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Then, when I expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when I multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part gets multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, resulting in 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. I think that makes sense. Let me check if there's another way to approach this problem. Alternatively, maybe I can consider the entire expansion as a product of two separate expansions and think about how the terms combine. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the exponents don't interfere with each other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

Wait, but that doesn't seem right because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are variables, so maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) would affect the overall coefficient. Hmm, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. So, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term remains, and the coefficients from the second expansion add up. So, the coefficient would be 6 (from the first part) times the sum of coefficients in the second part. Now, to find the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can set \\(c = 1\\), because substituting \\(c = 1\\) into the expression gives the sum of coefficients. So, let's compute \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64. So, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only present in the first part, so when I multiply by the second part, which is in terms of \\(c\\), the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are not affected. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would indeed be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, so 384. But wait, let me make sure. Let me think about it differently. Let me write the product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, for the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, it's \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\) times \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying the second part, \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in the second expansion is \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\). Now, when I multiply \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, I get \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2k}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that gets multiplied by \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), and since we're summing over all terms, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion. As before, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct. Wait, but let me check if there's another approach. Alternatively, maybe I can consider that since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, but in the problem, we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the right answer. Wait, but another thought: perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so that the coefficient is indeed 384. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that would be different, but as it is, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), so regardless of \\(c\\), so 384 is correct. Wait, but let me confirm by another method. Let me compute the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and see. The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when I multiply these two, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion is 6a^2b^2. When multiplied by each term in the second expansion, it becomes 6a^2b^2 times each term in the second expansion, which are terms like \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. As before, the sum of coefficients is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, I think the coefficient is 384. So, the final answer is 384.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think again. Is there a possibility that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) or something? Because if it is, then the answer would be different.

If I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then maybe I can just find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since the \\(c\\) terms are multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so actually, the coefficient would be 6 times each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire expression, it's multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me clarify: when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not correct because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has its own coefficient. So, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the expansion, each term would contribute a multiple of \\(a^2b^2\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the answer is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the \\(c\\) terms are separate, so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term, not considering the \\(c\\) part. So, perhaps the answer is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me think differently. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Because if you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you might get terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but perhaps the problem is only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which would be the constant term. Let me check the problem again. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. So, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expansion, which would include terms with different powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make more sense, as it would be a single number. Let me check that. So, if that's the case, then I need to find the term in the expansion where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as before. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me calculate that. Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the product of the coefficients from each part, it would be 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, that seems more reasonable. So, perhaps I was overcomplicating it earlier. Let me recap: The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But in reality, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all terms from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each of which has a different power of \\(c\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is typically a number, so perhaps it's intended to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), which would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, but that seems unlikely because the problem is expecting a single numerical answer. So, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficients of the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are specified, but since \\(c\\) isn't mentioned, perhaps the answer is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times each term in the expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't seem to fit the question. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expansion and looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that each term in the product is a combination of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and that's it, regardless of the other part. But that can't be right because the expression is the product of two polynomials, so the coefficients would combine. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach it differently. Let me consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't seem to fit the question's expectation of a single number. So, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. That would make the coefficient a single number. So, let's proceed under that assumption. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As calculated earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. So, I think that's the answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I initially thought it might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), but that would lead to a polynomial. However, given that the problem is likely expecting a single numerical answer, it's more reasonable to assume it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Therefore, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\).

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But that can't be right because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the product, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part.

Let me think: the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\).

Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6, and the \\(c\\) terms are separate.

Because any other term would involve \\(c\\) raised to some power, so \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^k\\) would give \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. So, I need to find two things: 1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found as 6. 2. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on the second part now. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). I need the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), I get \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients I found: 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which gives the coefficient 20. Multiplying them together gives 120. Yeah, that seems correct. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by multiplying the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. Constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiply these coefficients: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms when looking for \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, maybe not, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider that any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient would be 6 times whatever the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is. Wait, but the problem just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems a bit off because the question is about a specific term. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are in the first part, and \\(c\\) terms are in the second part. So, when I multiply these together, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part would be multiplied by every term in the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so when multiplied, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would have coefficients multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). But perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the entire expression is a product. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider that in the product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by all the terms in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Oh, wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but considering that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that seems odd because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some \\(c\\) terms, but the problem didn't specify any particular \\(c\\) terms, just \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), ignoring the other part, but that seems unlikely because the other part is multiplied in. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a number. Wait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times a specific term in the \\(c\\) expansion, but the problem statement doesn't specify. Hmm, perhaps I need to consider that the entire product is a combined expression, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times each term from the second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because we're only considering terms up to \\(a^2b^2\\). But that doesn't make much sense because the second part is multiplied in. Wait, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, or perhaps I'm misinterpreting it. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's only given as \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, that's unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just the coefficient from the first part times the entire second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because coefficients are typically constants. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is a separate expansion, so when multiplied, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient of 6 times each term in the second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would be the product of the coefficients from each part. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would require considering all possible combinations, but I'm getting confused. Let me try to approach it differently. Let me first expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6, as I found earlier. Now, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that as well using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) for \\(m\\) from 0 to 6. Now, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion, which has a coefficient of 6, will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times each term from the second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. Therefore, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would be a polynomial, not a constant. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the \\(c^0\\) term, i.e., the constant term in the second expansion. Let me check: If I set \\(c^0\\), then in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term occurs when the exponent is 0. So, from the expansion, the exponent is \\(6 - 2m\\), so setting that equal to 0: \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, if I multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part by the constant term from the second part, I get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), which would be 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, but that would require more information. Given that the problem states \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying any \\(c\\) terms, perhaps it's assuming that we are to consider the entire product and that the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only concerned with the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms and ignores the \\(c\\) part, but that would be unusual. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would be 6 times each term in the second expansion, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, perhaps the way to interpret this is that we are to consider the product as a single expression, and find the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But that's not a single coefficient; it's a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's only given as \\(a^2b^2\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be the product of the coefficients from each part. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), but that would require more information. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times each term in the second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the second part is a separate expansion, so when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) remains 6, and the rest is about \\(c\\). But that doesn't seem right because the entire product would have terms involving \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would require considering that the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times each term in the second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is a separate expansion, so the overall coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that seems odd because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be the product of the coefficients from each part. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that still doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a constant. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^{10}\\) or something like that, but that's just a guess. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). So, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, so 6 times 20 is 120. So, perhaps the answer is 120. Let me check that. So, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, if I multiply that by the 6 from the first part, I get 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) would be 120. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion, which is a polynomial. But since the problem didn't specify, perhaps it's assuming that we're only considering the constant term in \\(c\\), so the answer is 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would require considering the entire expansion, but that would involve a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense for a coefficient. Therefore, I think the most reasonable interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), which would be 120. So, I think the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. If I consider the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial. But that seems odd because coefficients are usually constants. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), which is 20, so 6 times 20 is 120. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but to be thorough, let me consider that the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would involve all possible \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is a separate expansion, so the overall coefficient is 6. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. So, I think the most reasonable answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to a polynomial in \\(c\\). When I multiply these two, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have coefficients that are multiples of 6, each multiplied by the corresponding term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be this polynomial. But that seems odd because coefficients are usually constants. Therefore, perhaps the problem is miswritten, or perhaps it's intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's only given as \\(a^2b^2\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, I think the most plausible interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), which is 20, so 6 times 20 is 120. So, the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\), the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems different from the 120 I thought earlier. Hmm, so which is it?\n\nWait, no, that's not the right approach. Substituting \\(c = 1\\) would make \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = 64\\), so the entire product would be 64 times \\((a + b)^4\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 64 times 6, which is 384. But that's different from 120. So, now I'm confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion, but that's a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but when I substitute \\(c = 1\\), I get a different result. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that's a polynomial. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is a separate expansion, so the overall coefficient is 6. But that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think in terms of generating functions. If I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, I can consider that the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only affected by the \\(c\\) terms when multiplied by 1, i.e., the constant term. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, giving 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that's a polynomial.

So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be 120, but when \\(c = 1\\), the entire coefficient becomes 384, which is different. So, I'm confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is a separate expansion, so the overall coefficient is 6.

Therefore, I think the most reasonable answer is 120, considering the constant term in \\(c\\).\n\nSo, to summarize: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check again. If I expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is indeed \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when I multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term (with coefficient 6) by this constant term, I get 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) is 120. So, I think that's the intended answer.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion, but that's a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, I think the answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\).

    "text": " The problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms? Wait, no, because when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) can be considered as coefficients themselves. So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of some term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, because we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the \\(c\\) terms are separate. So, actually, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times whatever the coefficient is for \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you just get \\(a^2b^2\\). Alternatively, if I'm not considering the \\(c\\) terms, maybe the \\(c\\) part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. Wait, but no, because the entire expression is the product of the two expansions. So, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and multiply it by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second part is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient times the \\(c\\) term. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\). So, all those terms will have \\(a^2b^2\\) as part of them, each multiplied by a different power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, how do I find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Is it correct to say that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part? Because each term in the second part is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so each of those terms contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, yes, it's 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I should think about it differently. Let me consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponent of \\(c\\), we get \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we are interested in the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, for each \\(m\\) from 0 to 6, the term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum over \\(m\\) from 0 to 6 of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Because each term in the second expansion contributes its own coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\). The sum of binomial coefficients \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. That seems to confirm my earlier result. So, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Is there a possibility that the \\(c\\) terms affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms in a way that I haven't considered? For example, maybe I'm supposed to consider cross terms where \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) combine in a way that affects the exponent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). But no, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so their exponents are independent. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, and when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by its own coefficient. So, that's another way to see that it's 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, I'm confident that the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps we're considering the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, maybe I need to think differently. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second.

Wait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), because when you multiply by the other expression, it's like you're scaling the entire expansion by the sum over all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit abstract. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. When you have two separate expressions multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. But in this case, the terms in \\((a + b)^4\\) involve \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), while the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) involve \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then in the product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64, giving 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's correct. Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating it because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the answer is just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is only determined by the first part. But that doesn't seem right either because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. Wait, but that would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that seems off. Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is treating \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as separate variables, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems very high. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is just 6, since the \\(c\\) terms are separate. Wait, but that can't be right because when you multiply, each term is multiplied by every term in the other expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times each term in the second expansion, but that's not possible because the coefficient of a term in a product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again: when you have two expressions multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the terms that multiply together to give that specific term. But in this case, the specific term is \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), any term would be a power of \\(c\\), say \\(c^k\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\), the term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would mean that the coefficient is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because every term in the second expansion would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but if we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then perhaps it's the sum over all \\(k\\) of the coefficients of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient can't depend on \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. That makes more sense. So, let me check: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 would be when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product would be 6 (from the first part) times 20 (from the second part), which is 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 120. Wait, that makes sense because when you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), you're effectively looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), so you have to multiply the coefficient from the first part by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), then you would have to consider the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^k\\). But since the problem just says \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's safe to assume that it's looking for the coefficient where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), so the answer would be 120. Let me double-check my steps. First, I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) which is 6. Then, I found the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) which is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, if I didn't consider the \\(c^0\\) term and just took the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, that would be 64, and 6 * 64 would be 384, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a specific term, not the sum over all terms. So, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion and multiply it by the coefficient from the first part. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem, which is 6. Then, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). But in the product, each term would be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{-m}\\), depending on the term from the second part. But \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from \\(k = 2\\) in the first part, and any term in the second part would multiply it by some coefficient. However, since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that would mean that the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second part multiplied by 6. Wait, but that would give the coefficient as 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought earlier. But let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2 respectively, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. In that case, I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be found using the binomial theorem. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\).

So, perhaps it's considering all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.

So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.

I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but I'm not entirely sure. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the \\(c\\) part. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems a bit odd because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by all possible terms from the second part, each with their own coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. But since the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think it's more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384. Wait, but let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second part. So, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. I think I need to clarify this. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which usually means the coefficient when considering all variables. But in this case, since the expression also involves \\(c\\), it's a bit ambiguous. However, in many problems like this, when they ask for the coefficient of a term that doesn't involve another variable, they are considering the coefficient as a polynomial in the other variables. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. To resolve this, let me think about how the problem is presented. It's written as \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, you'll have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) and \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{-m}\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120. But since the problem didn't specify \\(c\\), I think it's more likely asking for 384. However, I'm a bit unsure. Let me try to look for similar problems. Usually, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a term in a product of two expressions, they are considering the term as a whole, including all variables. But in this case, since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's ambiguous. But perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Therefore, I think the answer is 384. But I'm still a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expression, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, I think that's the right approach. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the constant term in the second part is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. But now I'm thinking it's 6 * 64 = 384. I need to clarify this.\n\nLet me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product. When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part. So, that would mean the coefficient is 6 * \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. That makes more sense because the problem is asking for a specific numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. So, I think the correct approach is to find the constant term in the second part, which is 20, and then multiply it by 6, giving 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the entire second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nI think I've confused myself enough. Let me try to approach it differently. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 * \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times a specific power of \\(c\\). But since it's not specified, perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 * (constant term of the second part) = 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, I think that's the correct interpretation. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. So, I think the answer is 120.\n\nBut let me confirm this by expanding both parts.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\) has the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6.\n\nSecond, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nThe constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, giving a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. Since the problem didn't specify \\(c\\), but just asked for \\(a^2b^2\\), it's likely that it's referring to the term where \\(c\\) is also at its zero exponent, making the answer 120.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, the correct interpretation must be that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nYes, I think that's the right approach. So, the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Does that mean I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms? Or maybe I do, but only in terms of how they affect the coefficient when multiplied. Wait, no, I think I might be overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, maybe I just need to find the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right because each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will have its own coefficient, but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would contribute to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) expanded, and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expanded, and I'm multiplying them together, then each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would mean that the coefficient is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those will contribute to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me check that. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients from the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, perhaps each term in the product will be of the form \\(a^k b^{4 - k} \\times c^m \\times (1/c)^n\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m + n = 6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that corresponds to \\(k = 2\\) in the first part, so the coefficient is 6, as I found before. But then, when we multiply by the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion will contribute a coefficient multiplied by \\(c^m\\), where \\(m\\) can range from -6 to 6 in steps of 2, I think. But since the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then perhaps the coefficient is indeed 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. But wait, let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But if that's the case, then the coefficient would just be 6 times each term in the second expansion, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6*64=384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the second part is multiplied by the first, so each term in the second expansion will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as a constant factor. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me check if that's correct. Let me think of it differently. Let me expand both parts separately and then see what the product looks like. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), when expanded, has terms \\(a^4, 4a^3b, 6a^2b^2, 4ab^3, b^4\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, can be written using the binomial theorem as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponents of \\(c\\) in the second part will be 6, 4, 2, 0, -2, -4, -6, corresponding to \\(k = 0\\) to \\(k = 6\\). So, each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Now, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, which has a coefficient of 6, will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because when you multiply 6a^2b^2 by each term in the second expansion, each of those terms will have a coefficient, and when you collect like terms, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Since the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), as I thought earlier. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Multiplying them gives 6*64=384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384. I think that makes sense. Alternatively, if I were to consider specific terms, but since the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), it's just the product of the two coefficients, so I think 384 is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. Hmm, I'm confused.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. The other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, is a sum of terms involving \\(c^k\\) and \\(c^{-k}\\). So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they all contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is when we set \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because when you set \\(c = 1\\), you're effectively summing the coefficients, but in reality, each term in the second expansion has its own coefficient, so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Wait, but that's not quite right because each term in the second expansion has its own coefficient, and when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term, the coefficient becomes 6 times each of those coefficients. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all those products. So, that would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion. Since the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64, as I thought before, then the coefficient would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me verify that. Let me consider a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 1 times the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion, which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 2, and similarly for \\(b\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, which is 1 \u00d7 2. Similarly, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. That seems to make sense.\n\nAlternatively, let me think about it another way. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you're effectively distributing \\(a^2b^2\\) across all those terms, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all the coefficients from the second part. Since the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64, the total coefficient is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me think about the expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. Then, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a sum of terms like \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\), so each term has a coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) and a power of \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, the resulting term is \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{k}a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384, because the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, if I set \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), \\(c = 1\\), then the value of the expression would be \\((1 + 1)^4 \\times (1 + 1)^6 = 2^4 \u00d7 2^6 = 16 \u00d7 64 = 1024\\). But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of this total. Wait, but that might not be directly helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as the product of two polynomials, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients from each polynomial for that term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) only comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients from the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to write it out more formally. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Then, when you multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term has a coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). The sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with a smaller exponent to see if this approach is correct. Suppose we have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\). The product would be \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be 1 \u00d7 (1 + 1) = 2, which is correct because \\(a^2c + a^2/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2 \u00d7 (1 + 1) = 4, and the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) would be 1 \u00d7 (1 + 1) = 2. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 2, which is 1 (the coefficient from \\((a + b)^2\\)) times 2 (the sum of coefficients from the second expansion). So, this approach seems to work. Therefore, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another thought: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply together to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the other part is in terms of \\(c\\), which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient, not the entire term, we can consider that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient becomes the product of the coefficients. Therefore, 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nSo, after all this thinking, I believe the coefficient is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives:\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me check again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and when multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it becomes 6 times the sum of all terms in that expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because I might be missing something. Let me try another approach. Maybe I should consider that the entire expression is a product of two separate expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384.

So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that would be different, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's 384. Wait, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the total coefficient would be 6 multiplied by each coefficient in the second expansion, and then when you sum all those, you get 6 times 64. So, yes, 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me try another approach. Let me first expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) separately and then see what happens when I multiply them. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) expands to \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).

The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand this, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\( \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m \\).

Now, for each term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the exponents of \\(c\\) will vary. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6, and when we multiply by the second part, we get terms like \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).

Let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. Because if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps without any \\(c\\) terms, but that doesn't make sense because the expression includes \\(c\\). Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That is, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting the variable to 1. So, \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because if so, then we need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, and then multiply that by the coefficient from the first part. So, let me try that approach. So, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the term where \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by 20, giving 120. Wait, that seems more reasonable. So, which is it? Is the problem asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), or specifically when the power of \\(c\\) is zero? Hmm, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying any particular power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps it's asking for the coefficient when \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. But that seems high, and I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible terms, but that would require considering all possible exponents of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Wait, no, the coefficient is a number, so perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem doesn't specify \\(k\\). Hmm, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". So, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms. That suggests that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that we need to find the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, and then multiply by 6, giving 384. But that seems a bit odd because usually, when you talk about the coefficient of a term in a product, you consider the term with specific exponents in all variables. But in this case, the variables are separate. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) as variables and \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would involve the sum over all possible \\(c\\) exponents. But that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that's not what the problem is asking; it's asking for the coefficient, which is a number. So, perhaps the correct interpretation is that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only interested in the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which would be 6 times 20, giving 120. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to approach this differently. Let's consider the entire expansion. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term will be of the form \\( \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m \\), which simplifies to \\( \\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m} \\). Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that would require that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for each term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the sum over all possible \\(m\\) of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). So, that would be \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But the sum of binomial coefficients \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, that seems like a lot. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we need to find the term where \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient from the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). But the problem didn't specify the power of \\(c\\), so I'm not sure which interpretation is correct. Let me think about how the problem is phrased. It says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". So, in the context of polynomials, when you have multiple variables, the coefficient of a specific term in one variable is the sum of the coefficients when multiplied by any power of the other variables. So, for example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all possible exponents of \\(c\\) of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that's not the case here because the problem asks for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. So, that can't be right. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the product, and since \\(c\\) is another variable, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. But to confirm, let me think of a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1 = (a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). If I expand this, I get \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) is also \\(c + 1/c\\). But if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a\\) in this expression, it would be \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial. However, in our original problem, the coefficient is a number, so perhaps the problem is expecting us to treat \\(c\\) as a constant and find the coefficient accordingly. Wait, but \\(c\\) is a variable, not a constant. Hmm, I'm getting more confused. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would involve all possible powers of \\(c\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem asks for the coefficient, implying a numerical value, so that can't be. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 120. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   We need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) in this expansion because we are interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\).\n\n3. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\).

So, when I multiply them, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I might not need to consider all the terms from the second expansion. Wait, but the \\(c\\) terms are separate from the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so when I multiply them, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit off because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. Since the problem is about \\(a^2b^2\\), which is only present in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), so the overall expression would have terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{(something with }c\\text{)}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate, their terms don't interact with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, no. Because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when multiplied by 6, each of those terms would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would actually be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But that can't be right because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the question. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. Because if we consider the product, the \\(c\\) terms could combine with \\(1/c\\) terms to give a constant term. Let me check the problem again: it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, perhaps the problem is assuming that we're looking for the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) also cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). Because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make much sense. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. That makes more sense. So, the approach would be: first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply those two coefficients together. Because when you multiply the two expansions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. So, let me calculate the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 times 20, which is 120. So, the final answer should be 120. Wait, but let me double-check. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when we multiply these two parts, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, including the \\(c^0\\) term, which is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.

That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would involve \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right for a coefficient. So, if that's the case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That would give me the numerical coefficient for the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, let's break it down. First, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. To find that, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). I need the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each expansion, which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but I should make sure I'm interpreting the problem correctly. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without any mention of \\(c\\). So, perhaps it's considering all possible terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a number. Therefore, it's more plausible that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. So, that would be 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, if the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. Since the problem is asking for a coefficient, I think it's more likely that they want the coefficient when \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. So, I think the answer is 120. Let me double-check my steps. From \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). From \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs at \\(k = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. Yes, that seems correct. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the expansion of each part separately and then combining the relevant coefficients.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0.

But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with \\(c\\). Wait, but actually, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, right? Or does it? Wait, no, because the expression is the product of both parts. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will multiply each term in the second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the \\(c\\) terms might not affect it. Wait, no, because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) would be multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6\\) (the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include all the \\(c\\) terms as well. But that seems complicated because \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a single coefficient, implying it's a numerical value. So, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" Hmm, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all terms, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) and contribute to the overall coefficient. Wait, but that might not be correct either. Let me think differently. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable. So, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is phrased as asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number. So, maybe I need to clarify. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when the entire expression is expanded, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we treat \\(c\\) as a separate variable and just focus on the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts. But that doesn't make sense because the \\(c\\) terms are part of the product. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is not a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), ignoring the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part. But that seems inconsistent because the problem includes both parts. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Hmm, perhaps I need to re-express the problem. Alternatively, maybe the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of the entire expression, treating all variables together. So, perhaps it's a multinomial expansion. But that might be more complicated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we can treat \\(c\\) as 1, but that seems like an approximation. Wait, no, that wouldn't be correct. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering the entire expression, which would involve summing over all possible \\(c\\) terms. But that seems complicated. Let me think again. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present in the product as \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a single coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is miswritten, or I'm misinterpreting it. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem doesn't specify that, so perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and ignoring the \\(c\\) terms. But that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, meaning that we need to consider all terms where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. In that case, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, but that's not quite right because the two parts are multiplied together, so each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, that might make sense. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, let me calculate that. First, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1/1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but that seems high. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficient is just 6, and the \\(c\\) terms don't affect it because \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\). But that can't be right because the entire expression is a product, so each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would indeed be a polynomial. But the problem is phrased as asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is miswritten, or I'm misinterpreting it. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve considering all possible combinations of \\(c\\) terms. But that seems too broad. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, ignoring the \\(c\\) terms, so just considering the part from \\((a + b)^4\\). But that would make the coefficient 6, which seems too simple. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. But that's not correct because the coefficients are combined when multiplying terms. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. Let me consider the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) expands to terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is not a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the \\(c\\) terms are irrelevant because the problem is only focusing on \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). But that seems inconsistent because the problem includes both parts. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all terms, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. As I calculated earlier, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 384. Wait, but that seems like a lot. Let me check that again. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed 2^6 = 64 when \\(c = 1\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients is 64. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by 64, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) becomes 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. But wait, let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with those of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is miswritten, or I'm misinterpreting it. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but considering only the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). That is, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be a specific term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. In that case, we would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. So, let me approach it that way. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem again. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (assuming we're considering \\(c^0\\)) is 120. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial, but the problem is asking for a single coefficient, so perhaps it's 120. That seems more reasonable. Let me confirm that approach. So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), then we need to find all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. But if we're only interested in the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), then the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, if we're considering all terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion, but that's a polynomial, not a single number. Therefore, the problem is likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering the \\(c\\) terms as well, but only the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120. So, I think that's the correct approach. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. This happens when \\(k = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n$\\boxed{120}$"
