The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the exponent \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(2m = 6\\), which means \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients: 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiplying them gives 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials, and when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all possible products of coefficients from each polynomial that result in \\(a^2b^2\\). But since the second polynomial doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and the constant term from the second. Therefore, it's indeed 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Alternatively, maybe I can think about the entire expansion. When you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion.

Therefore, only the term where the second expansion is \\(c^0\\) would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that's why we only take the constant term from the second expansion. So, 6 times 20 is 120.

So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, which is 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from the second part, which is 20. Since these are independent, when we multiply the two expressions, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I should think about expanding both parts and seeing how the terms multiply, but that might be more complicated. Let me consider that approach as a check. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) has terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\).

Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Is there a possibility that other terms could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by something else? For example, if there's a term with \\(a^3b\\) multiplied by a term with \\(1/c\\), would that somehow affect \\(a^2b^2\\)? No, because when you multiply, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) would change, but \\(1/c\\) is a separate variable, so it doesn't interact with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiplying it by the constant term from the second part. So, I think my initial conclusion is correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since these are two separate polynomials multiplied together, the variables are independent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for a term that has only \\(a^2b^2\\), then any term from the second polynomial that has a non-zero power of \\(c\\) would result in a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\) by itself. So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the term in the second polynomial that has \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed the product of the two coefficients: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nJust to make sure, let me consider a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). What's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Well, in \\((a + b)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{2}{2} = 1\\). In \\((c + 1/c)^1\\), the constant term is when \\(c^0\\), which would be when the exponent is 0. So, \\(c^1 \\times (1/c)^0 = c\\), and \\(c^0 \\times (1/c)^1 = 1/c\\). Wait, actually, in this case, there's no constant term because the exponents are 1 and -1. So, the constant term is zero. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 1 * 0 = 0. That makes sense because \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\) would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c\\) and \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1/c\\), but not \\(a^2b^2\\) itself. So, the coefficient is zero. So, that checks out.\n\nSimilarly, if I have \\((a + b)^3 \\times (c + 1/c)^3\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{3}{1} = 3\\) from the first part, and the constant term in the second part is \\(\\dbinom{3}{1.5}\\)... Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because \\(m\\) has to be an integer. Wait, in the expansion of \\((c + 1/c)^3\\), the exponents are \\(3 - 2m\\). So, to get \\(c^0\\), \\(3 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 1.5\\), which isn't possible because \\(m\\) must be an integer between 0 and 3. Therefore, there's no constant term, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b\\) would be 3 * 0 = 0. That makes sense too.\n\nSo, coming back to our original problem, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term exists because \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) gives \\(m = 3\\), which is an integer. So, the constant term is 20, as calculated earlier. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's solid.

    "text": " 2. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on that. To find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can again use the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\): \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) \u2192 \\(2m = 6\\) \u2192 \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of these two coefficients: 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, is that all? Let me double-check. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) in the second part is to take the constant term, which is \\(c^0\\), so the term is 20. So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) (which is 6a^2b^2) by 20 (from the second expansion), you get 6*20 a^2b^2, which is 120a^2b^2. So, the coefficient is indeed 120. Let me just think if there's another way this could be approached. Alternatively, maybe I can consider the entire expansion and see if there's any other term that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\), but I don't think so because the second part only contributes a scalar multiple when multiplied by the first part's \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n\nWait, hold on, actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is just the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and the constant term from the second part, so yeah, 6*20=120. That makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum over all terms in the second part, but since only the constant term contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, it's just 6*20. So, I think that's solid.\n\nSo, to recap: Coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Coefficient from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) for \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiply them: 6*20=120. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nI think that's the answer. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning.
