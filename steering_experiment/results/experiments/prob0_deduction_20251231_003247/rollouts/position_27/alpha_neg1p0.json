Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents: \\(c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is indeed 6, because \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). And the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply these two, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way that can happen is if I take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and the constant term from the second part.
