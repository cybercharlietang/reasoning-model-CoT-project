Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents: \\(c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\): \\(6 = 2m\\) \u21d2 \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, because when you multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will multiply the constant term in the second part, giving \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1\\) (since \\(c^0 = 1\\)), and the coefficient will be 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything here. Is there any other term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that could contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term when multiplied by \\((a + b)^4\\)? Hmm, no, because any term in the second polynomial that isn't \\(c^0\\) would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) term, which isn't present in \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, only the constant term from the second polynomial contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, I think that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Wait, but just to be thorough, let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when expanding, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, to get a term without \\(c\\), we need to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term (which is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2) by the constant term (which is 20). So, the term would be 6 \u00d7 20 \u00d7 a\u00b2b\u00b2, which is 120a\u00b2b\u00b2. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120. I don't see any mistakes in this reasoning. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the constant term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 20.\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients:**\n   Multiply the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."
