So, the exponent on \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the exponent to be 0 because we're looking for the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the constant term. So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.

But since we're only interested in the term where the product is \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), that's just 6 times 20, which is 120. So, I think that's correct. Let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), that's correct. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent is 0 is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), which is also correct. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120.

So, any term involving \\(c\\) would have a \\(c\\) exponent, so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would create a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the constant term in the second polynomial would multiply with \\(a^2b^2\\) to give a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, my earlier conclusion seems correct: the coefficient is 120. Yeah, I think that's right.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the expansion of each part separately and then multiplying the relevant coefficients.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   - The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) has the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) to find the constant term:**\n   - The term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when the exponent is 0, which happens at \\(m = 3\\), giving the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   - \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the two coefficients I found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, multiplying them together: 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) has \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The other part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), has a constant term (c^0) with coefficient 20. So, when you multiply the two polynomials together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, but only the constant term will contribute to \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. I think that makes sense.
