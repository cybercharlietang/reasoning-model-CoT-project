    "text": " Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. Wait, actually, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part, and the second part is just a separate expansion, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the terms from the second expansion must not involve \\(c\\) either. Wait, but that's impossible because \\(c\\) is present in the second part. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, when you multiply the two expansions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms can be anything because they don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) part. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes to a different part of the product, but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), we can consider the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, and then multiply that by the coefficient from the first part. So, first, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Now, we need to find the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). How do we find the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial? Well, one way is to substitute \\(c = 1\\) because that makes each term equal to its coefficient. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives us \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (from the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me check that again. Is that correct? Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, every term in the first expansion (which includes \\(a^2b^2\\)) is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the \\(c\\) terms can be anything, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would give a term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) times some \\(c\\) term. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), we sum all the coefficients from the second expansion, which is 64, and multiply by 6 to get 384. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each part because \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first expansion, and the second expansion can be any term. But since the second expansion's terms involve \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the product of the coefficients from each expansion. So, 6 (from the first part) times 64 (sum of coefficients from the second part) equals 384. Let me confirm this another way. Let's expand both parts separately and then see what the product looks like. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), when expanded, is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded using the binomial theorem, is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the expansion would have terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\) with various coefficients. Now, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) exponents, we can consider the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each multiplication by a term in the second expansion adds a multiple of \\(a^2b^2\\) with a coefficient equal to the coefficient of that term. Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion (which is 64). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me check if that's accurate. Alternatively, perhaps the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the \\(c\\) part must be such that it doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But in reality, when you multiply, every term from the second expansion will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would have to find the specific coefficient from the second expansion for \\(c^k\\) and multiply by 6. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient is the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion times 6. So, I think 384 is the correct answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that makes sense. I don't see any mistakes in that reasoning.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   To find the sum of all coefficients, substitute \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n   This means the sum of all coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64.\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   Since each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient from the first expansion and the sum of coefficients from the second expansion:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\).\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Substitute \\(c = 1\\) to find the sum of all coefficients:\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n   This means the sum of all coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64.\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient from the first expansion and the sum of coefficients from the second expansion:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

But since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient from that part is 6, and then the rest of the terms involving \\(c\\) would just be multiplied by 6. But wait, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all. So, when I expand \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would come from taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiplying it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not correct because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\)? Wait, that seems high. Let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, as I thought before. So, 6 times 64 is indeed 384. Hmm, but let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and when you expand it, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. So, 6 times 64 is 384. But I'm not entirely sure if that's the correct approach. Let me try another way. Maybe I can think of the entire expression as the product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because when you multiply each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64, as found by setting \\(c = 1\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Wait, but let me confirm this with a small example to make sure I'm not making a mistake. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we have \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no \\(b^2\\) term in the second factor, but wait, no, actually, in this case, the second factor is linear in \\(c\\), so when you multiply, the \\(a^2\\) term would be multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), giving \\(a^2c + a^2/c\\). Similarly, the \\(2ab\\) term would give \\(2abc + 2ab/c\\), and the \\(b^2\\) term would give \\(b^2c + b^2/c\\). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because there are no \\(b^2\\) terms in the product that don't involve \\(c\\). Wait, but that contradicts my earlier approach because in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero, but according to my earlier method, it would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^2\\) (which is zero, since the highest power is \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\), but actually, \\((a + b)^2\\) has \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero) multiplied by the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\), which is \\(c + 1/c\\), so sum of coefficients is 2. So, 0 \u00d7 2 = 0, which matches the actual expansion. So, that seems correct. So, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, so the total coefficient is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Wait, but let me think again: when I set \\(c = 1\\), \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), so the sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by this, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct answer. But just to be thorough, let me consider expanding \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for each term \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\). The sum of all coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\), as before. So, when I multiply this by \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\)s, that means we need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is a constant term, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because only then, when we multiply it by \\(a^2b^2\\), we'll get a term that's purely \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant. So, first, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do that, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).

Now, we want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.

Actually, the entire expression is the product of two expansions: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since we're looking for a term that only has \\(a^2b^2\\), and no \\(c\\) terms, that means we need to find the term in the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\), because when we multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), we want the \\(c\\) terms to cancel out, so that the overall term is just \\(a^2b^2\\) times a coefficient.

Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me use the binomial theorem again for this. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0, so set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, multiplying the two coefficients together: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times 20 (from \\(c^0\\)) gives 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(m = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 * 20 is 120. That seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n\\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

But that doesn't seem right because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would contribute a coefficient that would multiply the corresponding term from \\((a + b)^4\\). Wait, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is just the sum of all the coefficients in that expansion, because when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms would just add their coefficients together. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion.

But wait, is that correct? Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since we're looking for a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because \\(c^0\\) is the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would give a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by 6, which is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\). That makes more sense. So, let me work on finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 from the first part, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20 from the second part. Since these two are multiplied together in the overall expression, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20. So, when you multiply these two, the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of it as the entire expansion being the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) is indeed the product of their individual coefficients.

But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, it's actually the sum of all the products where the first part contributes \\(a^2b^2\\) and the second part contributes any term. Wait, but actually, no. Because when you multiply two expressions, the terms combine. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) which has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) which expands to some terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), then the product will have terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 6c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, that's not correct. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which includes all possible terms. But actually, when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that right? Because if I have \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\right)\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times (1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1)\\), because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(6 \\times\\) coefficient times \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, the resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes to a term with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (regardless of \\(c\\)) would be the sum of all those coefficients multiplied by 6. Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, that seems too high. Let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would mean considering the product as a single expression and finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384. But let me confirm this approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the product includes both \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the question is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384. But let me think differently. Maybe I should consider that the two parts are independent, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in each part. But in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), there is no \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the second part is zero. Wait, that can't be right because the second part is entirely in terms of \\(c\\), so when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, but since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out to the zero power. In that case, I would need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is the middle term. Let me check that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). To find the term where the exponent is zero, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying any \\(c\\) terms, so perhaps it's considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, meaning the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify any \\(c\\) term, so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering terms where \\(c\\) is also squared or something, but that's not specified. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\), as I found earlier. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(k = 2\\) in the first part, which gives \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\), and then it's multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but earlier I thought that if we're looking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would be 120. But the problem didn't specify \\(c\\), so I think it's 384. Let me confirm by another approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire product as a product of two independent expansions. The first part gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has terms with various powers of \\(c\\). When I multiply the two, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part gets multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. The sum of coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would be 6 * 20 = 120, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), it's 384. So, I think the answer is 384. Wait, but I'm not 100% sure because sometimes problems like this might expect you to consider only the constant term in \\(c\\). But the problem didn't specify, so I think the correct approach is to consider all terms, leading to 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in the second expression is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Because if we take any other term with a positive or negative exponent of \\(c\\), when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would result in a term that includes \\(c\\) raised to some power, which isn't what we want.

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. Because if you have \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), their product can give \\(c^0\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me check that. The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), setting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that doesn't seem right because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient, but I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach. Let me consider that when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But I'm not entirely sure if that's the correct interpretation. Let me try to verify. If I consider the entire product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) ranges from -6 to 6 in steps of 2, perhaps. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so we set \\(k = 2\\), which gives \\(a^2b^2\\), and then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that sum is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Wait, but let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product comes from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial by every term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second polynomial. But that's a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0, respectively. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a single number. So, let me try that approach. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then multiply them together. That makes more sense. So, first, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 times 20, which is 120. So, the final answer should be 120. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) as 6. Then, I needed the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which I found by setting the exponent to 0, leading to \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient being 20. Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. That seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering the \\(c^0\\) term, is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   To get \\(c^0\\), set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both parts:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. Actually, the expression is a product of two separate binomial expansions. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives a term \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives some terms involving \\(c\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient would be 6 times whatever the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right because each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by each term in \\((a + b)^4\\). But since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), we can take the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the \\(c\\) expansion will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing to the overall coefficient. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me approach it differently. When you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that correct? Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient and a power of \\(c\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps we need to consider all the terms in the second expansion, regardless of their \\(c\\) power, because when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they will all contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the final product. So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). How do I do that? Well, the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. So, then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is not a polynomial; it has negative exponents as well. But when I set \\(c = 1\\), it still works because \\(1^{-1} = 1\\), so each term becomes a positive integer. So, the sum of coefficients is indeed 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384. Let me double-check this approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part and any term in the second part, regardless of \\(c\\), because when multiplied, the \\(c\\) terms won't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I should expand both expressions and see. Let me try a different approach. Let's consider that \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents on \\(c\\), we get \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we are interested in the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\), which means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), which gives us \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for each such term, the exponent on \\(c\\) can be anything because the problem doesn't restrict \\(c\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum over all possible \\(m\\) from 0 to 6. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Wait, but \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\), as before. So, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two coefficients because the two parts are independent. Since \\((a + b)^4\\) contributes 6 to \\(a^2b^2\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a sum of coefficients 64, then the product would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find this, I first found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, since the other part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) contributes all its coefficients when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), I calculated the sum of all coefficients in that expression by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gave me 64. Multiplying these together, 6 * 64, gives 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. I think that makes sense. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be found by considering each part separately. \n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):** Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Considering \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):** The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n\n3. **Combining both parts:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms from each polynomial that multiply together to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if we take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because any other term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would have a \\(c\\) exponent, and since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only contribution comes from the constant term in the second expansion. So, that means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, as I calculated earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, it becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Since we're multiplying the two expansions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would indeed be the product of the two coefficients I found. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. I think that's correct, but let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second part, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). But wait, no, because the second part has multiple terms, but only the constant term contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. Any other term from the second part would have a \\(c\\) term, which would make the product have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something, which isn't what we want.

    "text": " Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), any terms involving \\(c\\) would not affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables. Wait, but actually, no, because the entire expression is a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can consider the part of \\((a + b)^4\\) that gives \\(a^2b^2\\), which we already found to be 6, and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, that doesn't sound right. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term in the product would be the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and the constant term (if any) from the second polynomial. Wait, but in this case, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so when we multiply it by \\(a^2b^2\\), the result would be \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that can't be right because then the coefficient would involve terms with \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for a numerical coefficient, not involving \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression, and when expanded, it's a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that's a polynomial in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which might just be the coefficient in front of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would involve multiplying the coefficients from both expansions. Wait, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems odd. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a single number. Let me think about that. If I consider the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, if I'm looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), that would correspond to \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering the entire expression, and the coefficient is a polynomial. But that seems unlikely because usually, when asked for a coefficient, it's a numerical value unless specified otherwise. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so just the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. But that doesn't seem right because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), so the sum of coefficients is 64. So, if I take 6 * 64, that's 384. But I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve multiplying the coefficients from each part. So, since \\((a + b)^4\\) gives a coefficient of 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be considered as a separate polynomial, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms don't affect it. Wait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the other expansion, resulting in \\(a^2b^2\\) times a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is usually a number, not a polynomial. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. Let me check the problem again: it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, maybe it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is unusual. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts, and the \\(c\\) part is separate, so the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient should be a number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be a number. Let me assume that and proceed. So, if I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that would be the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\) from the other expansion. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Now, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is the middle term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the term where \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, I think that's the answer. Let me double-check. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) has a coefficient of 20. Therefore, when you multiply the two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, giving a total coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, when you expand the product, each term will be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), that is, we're considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, each multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But wait, no, that's not quite right. Wait, actually, when you multiply, the variables are independent. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) and any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, no, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the product, but it's multiplied by terms from the other expansion, so the entire term would be \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) something involving \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all the coefficients from the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion multiplied by the 6 from \\((a + b)^4\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, I think I'm getting confused here. Let me clarify: When you have two expressions multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. But in this case, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), not \\(c\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is a different term. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the case when \\(k = 0\\), so that the term is just \\(a^2b^2\\) times 1. Therefore, the coefficient is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, let's compute that. We already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k - k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and it's multiplied by the constant term from the other expansion, which is 20, so yes, 6 times 20 is 120. So, the coefficient should be 120. Alternatively, I can think of it as the entire product being a multiplication of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 times 20, which is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the product of the relevant terms from each binomial expansion. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**  \n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**  \n   The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\).

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to approach it differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).

So, we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), which gives us \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for each \\(m\\) from 0 to 6, the term will have \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), we need to consider the entire coefficient from the \\(c\\) part.

That can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but the coefficient would then involve terms with \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which typically refers to the numerical coefficient, treating other variables as constants. Wait, but in this case, the expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's expecting the coefficient to be a numerical value, implying that the \\(c\\) terms must cancel out, i.e., the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. Let me check that.

When you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the \\(c\\) terms, that becomes \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for each \\(m\\) in the second part, we have a term \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), does that mean we need to sum over all possible \\(m\\) values? Wait, no, because each term in the product will have a specific power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think differently. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which is only in the first polynomial, the second polynomial will contribute a factor that doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests it's a constant. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all variables, which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term, it's in the context of treating other variables as constants. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering \\(c\\) as a separate variable and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is the product of the coefficients from both expansions, summed over all possible \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that would be the case if we were looking for a specific term involving both \\(a^2b^2\\) and a specific power of \\(c\\). Since the problem doesn't specify a power of \\(c\\), I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would involve summing over all possible \\(c\\) terms. But that seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then considering that multiplied by the entire second expansion, so the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. That means we need to consider all terms in the expansion where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be the sum of the products of the coefficients from \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) for each term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the term \\(k = 2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then for each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by 64, which is 384. Wait, that seems plausible. Let me verify. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, does that make sense? Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by the corresponding term in \\((a + b)^4\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if I think about it differently, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and since every term in the second polynomial is multiplied by this, the total contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second polynomial. So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. In this case, since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which only comes from the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial, and it's multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient would be 6 (from the first polynomial) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if I expand both polynomials separately and then multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. So, I think 384 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me check another approach. Let's consider that when you have \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2. Then, when you multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you get 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. That confirms it again.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and since the second polynomial is being multiplied by this term, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire second polynomial. But if we're only interested in the coefficient, not the variable part, then we need to consider that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. So, that's 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think I've convinced myself that the coefficient is 384. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. So, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), that's correct. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " Wait, no, actually, I think that's not quite right. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply by the entire expansion, you'd be changing the coefficients. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to clarify. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is multiplied by it, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's just 6, and the \\(c\\) terms are separate? Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the entire expression, when expanded, what's the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the exponent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, each term in the expansion will be of the form (coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\)) times (coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)) times \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or something like that. But since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from \\(k = 2\\) in the \\((a + b)^4\\) expansion, the coefficient would be 6 (from \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\)) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. Because otherwise, if it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely. Maybe the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but perhaps it's considering the coefficient in the entire expansion, so it's 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient isn't a single number, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not quite right either. Let me think differently. Maybe the problem is to consider the product of the two expansions, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), because that's how you sum the coefficients. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me check that logic again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6, multiplied by every term in the second expansion, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, as I thought. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which would be the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 times 20, which is 120. So, depending on whether the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) or specifically \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), the answer would be different. But given that the problem is stated as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying \\(c\\), it's more likely that it's considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, so 384. But I'm a bit confused because if you don't specify the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient isn't a single number, it's a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Let me check that. If I consider the entire product, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as before. Then, for the \\(c\\) part, it's \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\), it must be that \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the expansion of each part. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):** Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):** We seek the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0).

Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we need the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero. Because if \\(c\\) is raised to some power, then that term would involve \\(c\\), but we're only interested in the constant term (with respect to \\(c\\)) because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) in it.

So, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's work on that. Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents: \\(c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\): \\(6 = 2m\\) \u2192 \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense either. Let me try to clarify. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply together to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that correct? Because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first part, and the second part has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part would contribute its own coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), because that makes each term's coefficient equal to the term itself. So, let me compute that. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first part, and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part. But that doesn't sound right either. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because for each term in the second part, which is a term involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get a term like \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) (some term in \\(c\\)). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think that the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because in the product, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part, but the variables are separate. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part, which are terms like \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that means we're summing over all possible terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because for each term in the second part, the coefficient is added to the product. So, yes, as I thought earlier, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64, so the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of the second part. But since the second part is a separate variable, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't change; it's just multiplied by the entire second expression. But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, not an expression. So, perhaps the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, 6, and the second part is treated as a constant factor. But that doesn't seem right either because the second part is also an expression, not a constant. Alternatively, perhaps the second part's expansion doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because it's in a different variable. So, maybe the coefficient remains 6. But that contradicts my earlier thought. Hmm, I'm confused now.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in one polynomial doesn't affect the other variables. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, because the second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, perhaps the coefficient remains 6. But that seems too simple. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the second part contributes a factor that affects the overall coefficient. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the second part is multiplied as a whole, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. That seems more plausible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). But I'm not sure. Let me try to approach it differently. Let's expand both parts separately and then see how they multiply. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) expands to \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Now, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are terms like \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the resulting terms will be \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that means we need to consider all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, which is just the 6 times each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me check this again because I might be making a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would include all possible terms from the multiplication, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first part, the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, 6, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that seems contradictory because when you multiply by the second part, you're effectively scaling the first part by the entire second expression. So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expression, but that would mean the coefficient is not a number but a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me think about it another way. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). The product P(a, b) * Q(c) will have terms that are products of terms from P and terms from Q. So, each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term comes only from the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in P multiplied by each term in Q. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times\\) (sum of coefficients in Q). Since Q is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the sum of its coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by considering the binomial expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Set \\(c = 1\\) to find the sum, which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The overall coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because we're multiplying the two expansions together. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, if I'm looking for a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), result in a term that has only \\(a^2b^2\\), meaning the \\(c\\) terms must cancel out, right? Wait, but actually, no. Wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some terms involving \\(c\\), but the problem just wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that specific term. So, in this case, I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part, and \\(c\\) is in the other, the \\(c\\) part doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), does that mean that the coefficient is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a constant. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a constant. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, maybe the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we're supposed to consider the entire expansion and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a constant, not a sum of terms. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to treat the entire expression as a single expansion and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and when multiplied by terms from the second part, it would produce terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) to give a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term. Wait, no, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but \\(a^2b^2\\) itself isn't present unless \\(k=0\\), which would require that the second part contributes a constant term. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find two things: 1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we found to be 6. 2. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply these two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. Okay, so let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, multiplying the two coefficients together: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times 20 (from \\(c^0\\)) equals 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying them gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, if I were to expand the entire expression, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by every term in the second part, but only the term with \\(c^0\\) would result in a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, so they wouldn't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, only the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) and the constant term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hence, 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that makes sense. I think I'm confident that 120 is the correct coefficient.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{120}"

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients combine. So, if I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), it can only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term involving \\(c\\), you'll end up with a term that has \\(c\\) in it, which isn't what we want. So, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by the constant term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find two things: 1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found to be 6. 2. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on the second part now. The expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I can expand this using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, I need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\) so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the two coefficients I found: 6 and 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient should be 120. Wait, let me check if I did that correctly. So, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives me 6 as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives me 20 as the constant term. Multiplying these together, 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes here.
