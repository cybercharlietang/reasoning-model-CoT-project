    "text": " Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. But since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes only from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, and the other part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, so when we multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. But since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part, the second part will contribute a factor that's just the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. Actually, when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in \\((a + b)^4\\), and not in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not correct either. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients add up in a way that each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present in the second polynomial, the coefficient in the product would just be the same as the coefficient in the first polynomial. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the second polynomial is multiplied by the first, so every term in the first is multiplied by every term in the second. But \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first is a term, and when multiplied by the second polynomial, it becomes \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps we're supposed to treat the entire \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as a scalar and just multiply it by the coefficient 6? But that can't be right because then the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expression, but I think I'm overcomplicating it. Wait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But how do I find the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Well, the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all the coefficients in the second expression is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, that seems high. Let me check. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, each term in the second part is a multiple of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384. But let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) would not affect the exponent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me make sure. Let me think of it as multiplying two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and one in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient in the first polynomial, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 is indeed 384. So, I think that's the answer. But let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps I should expand both parts and see. Let's see, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), let's expand that. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for each term \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\). Now, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first will be multiplied by each term in the second, which are all the terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, as I calculated before. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. So, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), yielding 64. Multiplying these together gives the final coefficient.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{384}"

    "text": " Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. Actually, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can treat the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part as a single term, because it doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, that doesn't sound right. Let me clarify: The expression is a product of two separate binomial expansions. So, when we expand each part separately, we'll have terms from each expansion multiplied together. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can find the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\), which we found as 6, and then the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will be a constant multiplier for that term, because it doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Wait, but that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient in the product, so maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the entire \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is just a scalar multiple. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times a constant (the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times that constant. But wait, no, because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is not a constant; it's an expression in terms of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is considering the product as a whole, and we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, but that would mean that any terms involving \\(c\\) are part of the coefficient. So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) itself, because each term in that expansion is a coefficient for the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me try to structure this more clearly.\n\nFirst, let's consider the two parts separately:\n\n1. \\((a + b)^4\\) expanded using the binomial theorem gives terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\), with coefficients given by the binomial coefficients. As we found, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\n2. \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can also be expanded using the binomial theorem. Let's compute that. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion (with coefficient 6) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient, which should be a numerical value, not an expression in terms of \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but only considering the \\(a^2b^2\\) term and its associated coefficients from the other expansion. But that still seems unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In other words, we're to find all the terms where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), and sum their coefficients. But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider each term in the product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each possible power of \\(c\\). But the problem doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so perhaps it's indeed considering the entire expansion and just wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me check that. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, without considering \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient is not a single number but a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, maybe the problem is written in a way that \\(c\\) is a separate variable, and we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Wait, the problem just says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering the entire product and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. Therefore, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a product, and we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, setting \\(c = 1\\), we have \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and perhaps it's considering each term separately. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, which would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, and it should be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) or something like that. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and since the other part is multiplied by it, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the \\(a^2b^2\\) term and not worrying about the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient is 6. But that seems too simple. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, meaning that we have to consider the product of the two expansions, and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and since the other part is a separate expansion, the coefficient remains 6. But that seems too straightforward, and I think the problem is expecting more. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem, and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would involve considering all possible cross terms. Wait, no, because in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term from the second part, each of which is a power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), multiplied by 6. But that sum is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. But let me check this again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and since the other part is multiplied by it, the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and that's the answer. But that seems too simple, and I think the problem is expecting to consider the entire product, so I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiply it by the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, giving 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let's think about it differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion (with coefficient 6) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). The sum of coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would have to compute the coefficient for that specific term. But since it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient is the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check this again because I might be making a mistake. Let me think about the product of two polynomials. If I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c), then the coefficient of a term in P(a, b) would be multiplied by the entire polynomial Q(c). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) is 6, and when multiplied by Q(c), it becomes 6Q(c). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6Q(c), which is a polynomial in c. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a number, not a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating c as a variable, but the coefficient would then be a polynomial in c, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, implying a numerical value. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the power of c, meaning that we have to sum the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by all possible powers of c. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in Q(c), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and that's the answer. But that seems too simple, and I think the problem is expecting to consider the entire product, so I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, let me try another approach. Let me compute the entire product and see what the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is. So, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15\\dfrac{1}{c^2} + 6\\dfrac{1}{c^4} + \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\). So, when we multiply these two, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. The term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times (c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15\\dfrac{1}{c^2} + 6\\dfrac{1}{c^4} + \\dfrac{1}{c^6})\\). So, the coefficient is \\(6c^6 + 36c^4 + 90c^2 + 120 + 90\\dfrac{1}{c^2} + 36\\dfrac{1}{c^4} + 6\\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in this context would be the entire expression above. But that's a polynomial in c, not a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is miswritten, or perhaps I'm misinterpreting it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the power of c, which would mean that we sum all the coefficients, leading to 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second expansion). The sum of coefficients in the second expansion is when c = 1, which is 2^6 = 64. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but that seems to make sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this by considering a simpler case. Suppose we have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\) would expand to \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), but if we consider the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) regardless of c, we would set c = 1, giving (1 + 1) = 2. So, the coefficient would be 2. Alternatively, if we consider the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 2, then 1 * 2 = 2, which matches. So, in this simpler case, the approach works. Therefore, applying the same logic to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Considering the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The sum of the coefficients of this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives:\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

Because if we take any other term from the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion, it would introduce a \\(c\\) term, which would mean the product would have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some \\(c\\) power, but since the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), we need the term where the \\(c\\) terms multiply to give 1, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, first, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) has a coefficient of 6, and when we multiply it by the constant term 20 from the other expansion, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when we multiply the two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. Therefore, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first will be multiplied by the constant term 20, giving \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, if I were to expand everything, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by multiplying the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) (which is 6) by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) (which is 20), resulting in \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Wait, no. Actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(c\\) terms are separate, maybe the coefficient will just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, that can't be right because the problem is a product of two expressions, so the coefficients would multiply. Wait, no, I think I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term comes only from the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), multiplied by every possible term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that seems off. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term would have different powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same across all those terms, right? So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that might not be correct because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those terms, the coefficients would add up. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so that would be \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems too straightforward. Let me check if I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the answer is simply 6, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion, so the coefficients would indeed multiply. Wait, no, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, when you multiply by the second part, each term in the second part will just add a factor, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all the terms. But wait, if I think about it, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms from each polynomial. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first polynomial, and the second polynomial has terms involving \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, for example, if the second polynomial has a term like \\(c^3\\), then \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^3\\) would be a term in the product, but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same across all these terms. So, the total coefficient would be the coefficient from the first polynomial times the sum of the coefficients from the second polynomial. Therefore, I think my initial calculation is correct: 6 times 64 is 384. But let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the entire product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and when you expand this, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the \\(c\\) terms, that becomes \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, which means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), which gives the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, for each \\(m\\) from 0 to 6, the term will have \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from the second polynomial, which is indeed the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to 6. And that sum is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because when you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum over all combinations where the exponents add up to that term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the exponent of \\(c\\) can be anything, so the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire sum of coefficients in the second polynomial. So, yes, 6 times 64 is 384. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

Actually, since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part is in terms of \\(c\\), perhaps the entire expression is a product of two expansions, and we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms.

But that would mean that the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because then the coefficient would depend on \\(c\\). Wait, that can't be right. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Oh, so the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when we multiply them together, each term in the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we can treat the second polynomial as a constant when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because in reality, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is being multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, essentially, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, is that correct? Let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply by the other polynomial, each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the coefficient we're looking for is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, how do we find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if we substitute \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we'll get the sum of the coefficients. Let's compute that: \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by 64, which is 384. Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this product, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all \\(k\\) and \\(m\\) such that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) implies that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and then for each \\(m\\), the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can have any \\(m\\) from 0 to 6, but the term \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\) must be 1, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a constant term with respect to \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. Actually, when multiplying by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion is multiplied by each term in \\((a + b)^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, if I think about it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) being \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) being the sum of the coefficients where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Wait, but that's not the case here because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so the coefficient is just \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because then the coefficient would depend on \\(c\\), which it shouldn't. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try a different approach. Let's consider that the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). We need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\). So, when we expand the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As calculated earlier, the sum of coefficients is 64, so the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if I consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) and the rest of the terms are multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient, not the entire term, it's just 6 times the sum of coefficients in the other polynomial. So, I think that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a^2b^2. When we multiply this by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in the product will be 6a^2b^2 multiplied by \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that would be the term where \\(c^{6 - 2m} = c^0 = 1\\). So, we need to find the value of \\(m\\) such that \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20 \\times 1 = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)), which gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, let me check that again. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, correct. Then, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, when we multiply these together, 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire coefficient being the product of the coefficients from each part because the terms are multiplied together. So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe I should compute the expansions separately and see. So, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Then, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me compute that. Using the binomial theorem, it's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the terms are:\n\n- \\(m = 0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1 \\times c^6\\)\n- \\(m = 1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^{4} = 6c^4\\)\n- \\(m = 2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^{2} = 15c^2\\)\n- \\(m = 3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\)\n- \\(m = 4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(m = 5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(m = 6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the constant term is indeed 20. Therefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find the term in the second expansion that is a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but is that the case? Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, if I have \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by 20, that gives \\(120a^2b^2\\). So, yes, the coefficient is 120. Therefore, the answer should be 120.\n\nBut let me think again to make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if you take any other term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it would introduce a \\(c\\) term, which would make the term in the product have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is non-zero, which we don't want. Therefore, only the constant term from the second expansion will contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me consider an alternative approach. Suppose I expand both parts and then multiply them together, but that might be more complicated. Alternatively, since the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I can consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because any other term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would introduce a \\(c\\) term, which would make the term not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that's consistent with what I thought earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product of two separate polynomials, and when you multiply them, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since we're looking for a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and not \\(c\\), we have to ensure that the \\(c\\) part is canceled out, which happens only when we multiply by the constant term from the second polynomial.\n\nWait, another way to think about it is that the entire expression is a product of two independent polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second polynomial. But wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only term in the second polynomial that contributes is the constant term, because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) term, which would make the product term have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't what we want. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (the constant term), giving 120.\n\nWait, but to confirm, let's think about how the multiplication works. When you have \\((a + b)^4\\) expanded, each term is \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\) with coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\). Then, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is expanded as \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when you multiply these together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). When you multiply this by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear in the product as \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, for this term to be just \\(a^2b^2\\), the exponent of \\(c\\) must be zero, which happens when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product, I think that the coefficient will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I need to consider that the entire expression is the product of two independent polynomials, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the product of the coefficients from each part. But in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in the second part, since it's being multiplied, the coefficient for each term in the second part is 1 (because it's just being multiplied as a whole). Wait, no, that's not right. The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps it's considering all possible combinations where the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) exponents. Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384. But let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second part. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is not a number but a polynomial. That doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the correct approach is to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. Wait, but let me confirm. Let me think of it as two separate expansions. The first expansion is \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply them, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), etc., up to \\(c^{-6}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in multiple terms, each with different powers of \\(c\\). However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that it's considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent. But that would imply that the coefficient is the same as 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Since the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would need to find the specific coefficient in the second expansion for \\(c^k\\) and multiply it by 6. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms, I think it's considering all possible \\(c\\) exponents, so the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Let me see if that makes sense. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to recognize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the rest of the expression is just a scalar multiple, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.

Then, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 20, which is 120. That makes sense because when you multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and the constant term (in \\(c\\)) from the second part would combine to give \\(120a^2b^2\\). So, I think that's the answer.\n\nLet me recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.

The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Then, multiply these two coefficients together: 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nI think I got it now. The key was realizing that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would involve multiplying the coefficient from the first part by the constant term (in \\(c\\)) from the second part. So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), giving \\(m = 3\\).

Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will have coefficients multiplied by each of those terms. But actually, no, that's not quite right either. Let me think again. Let me denote \\(A = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(B = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, the product is \\(A \\times B\\). So, when you expand this, each term in \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find all the terms in \\(B\\) that are constants, i.e., terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a constant with respect to \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not correct either. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply it by any term from \\(B\\), which is a function of \\(c\\), the result will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only come from the terms in \\(B\\) that are constants, i.e., terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because otherwise, you'd have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but actually, no. Because in the product \\(A \\times B\\), \\(A\\) has terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(B\\) has terms involving \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(B\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would require that the term from \\(B\\) is a constant, i.e., \\(c^0\\), so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(B\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on that. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. Let me write that out: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term: \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). We found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the other expression is 20.

But since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be a term without \\(c\\), so perhaps I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is a constant term, i.e., where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains as \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), you get \\(a^2b^2\\). If you multiply by other terms involving \\(c\\), you'd get terms like \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), which are not \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me try to expand that. Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).

Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.

    "text": " Wait, no, actually, I think I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I can treat the entire \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not quite right because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a separate expansion. Let me think again. Actually, the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the first expansion, and the second expansion involves \\(c\\) terms, the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents.

But wait, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a single coefficient, not a polynomial. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but without considering the \\(c\\) terms. Alternatively, maybe it's considering all possible terms, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the product of the coefficients from each expansion. Let me check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the expansion will have terms involving various powers of \\(c\\), but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps we can consider the entire expansion of the second part as a single term, or maybe it's just 1? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve multiplying the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. So, let me break it down. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply those two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. That seems correct because when you multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero will contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. So, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent is zero, so set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\), and we found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. The second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when you multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find the term in the second expansion that doesn't change the \\(c\\) exponent, which is \\(c^0\\). So, yes, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about it differently. Let me consider the entire product: \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) multiplied by \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we want the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for the second part, we want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient from the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the term is \\(6 * 20 a^2b^2 c^0 = 120 a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120. That confirms my earlier calculation. So, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Is there a possibility that other terms in the second expansion could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by terms from the first expansion? No, because the first expansion only has terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second expansion only has terms involving \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are determined solely by the first expansion, and the exponents of \\(c\\) are determined solely by the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is determined by the product of the coefficients from each expansion where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) match the desired term. Since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), but in the product, each term will have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the product would include all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Wait, but that's not the case. Actually, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, the exponents add. So, for example, \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which has various powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only consider the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me think again. If the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then perhaps it's considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent. But that can't be, because in the product, each term will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents and \\(c\\) exponents. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only appear once, multiplied by a specific power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include any term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, but without considering the \\(c\\) exponents. Wait, no, that's not how it works. Each term in the product is a combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) exponents. So, \\(a^2b^2\\) would only be present in the term where the \\(c\\) exponent is zero, because otherwise, it would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120. So, I think I'm confident with that answer.\n\nLet me recap: To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, I first found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, I found the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations. The binomial coefficients seem correct, and the logic follows. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem, which is 6. Next, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these coefficients together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{120}"

So, when you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). So, simplifying the \\(c\\) terms: \\(c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find all terms where \\(a^{4 - k}b^k = a^2b^2\\). That implies \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, from the first part, \\(k = 2\\), which gives us \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for the \\(c\\) terms, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can have any power of \\(c\\). Wait, but when you multiply, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not correct because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would contribute to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{n}\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). Hmm, but that seems confusing. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when multiplied by any term from the second polynomial, it would create a term involving \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only be the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, because otherwise, it's a different term. Wait, no, that's not correct. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself doesn't involve \\(c\\), but when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all the terms in the second polynomial. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term in the second polynomial becomes a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by that term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients of a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, in this case, setting \\(c = 1\\), the sum of the coefficients is \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient from the first part is 6. Then, the term from the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), we need to find the term in the second polynomial where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, let's find that. The general term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, going back, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part (6) multiplied by the coefficient from the second part (20), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, so earlier I thought it was 384, but that was a mistake because I was considering the sum of all coefficients, which isn't necessary. The correct approach is to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero in the second polynomial, which gives 20, and then multiply by 6, resulting in 120. Let me confirm this. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives \\(c^0\\) with coefficient 20. So, multiplying these together, the term is \\(6 \\times 20 \\times a^2b^2c^0 = 120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120. That makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20.

When you multiply two polynomials together, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial.

Because when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) (from the first part) by this constant term, it will contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the overall product.

    "text": " Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Wait, actually, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking only for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider that term separately. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) as we found, with a coefficient of 6. Then, when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion will be multiplied by 6. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps the coefficient will just be 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other part is in \\(c\\). So, perhaps I need to consider the entire expression and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\). Wait, but the expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply them, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, that doesn't sound right. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's not correct because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since the problem is asking for the coefficient, not the term, perhaps it's just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not right either. Let me think again. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is another polynomial, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not quite accurate because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has different powers of \\(c\\), but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term in the product will be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that coefficient would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that can't be right because the coefficient is a number, not a polynomial. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the other in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables are separate. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is 6, and when multiplied by the entire second polynomial, each term in the second polynomial will have a coefficient multiplied by 6. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the product would be 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would involve terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is implicitly asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Let me check that. If that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply them together. That would make sense because when you multiply the two polynomials, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first and \\(c^0\\) from the second would combine to form \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), and the coefficient would be the product of the two coefficients. So, let me proceed under that assumption. First, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), we multiply the coefficients from each part: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but let me double-check. Is there a possibility that I'm missing something? For instance, when multiplying the two polynomials, could there be other terms that also contribute to \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)? But no, because in the first polynomial, the only term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is the one with coefficient 6, and in the second polynomial, the only term with \\(c^0\\) is the one with coefficient 20. So, when you multiply them, the only contribution to \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, I think that's the correct coefficient.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by considering the contributions from both parts of the product. \n\n1. **From \\((a + b)^4\\):** The term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **From \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):** The term with \\(c^0\\) (i.e., the constant term) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nMultiplying these coefficients together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's actually the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me clarify: when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expression, each term will have a coefficient, and all those coefficients will add up to the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, that means I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, how do I find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Well, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me double-check that. Because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and when we multiply by the second part, each term in the second part will just add a multiple to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so indeed, the total coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the second part doesn't affect the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the product of the coefficients from each part. Since the second part is multiplied by the first, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the sum of coefficients. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when \\(c = 1\\), is indeed 2^6 = 64. So, that part is correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but actually, let me think again. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of the two expressions. But when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms in the first polynomial that multiply to give that term, and similarly for the second polynomial. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only present in the first polynomial, and \\(c\\) is only in the second, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will only come from the first part, and when multiplied by any term in the second part, it will result in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then actually, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, but that's not quite accurate because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, each of which has a coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part contributes to the coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, that means the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by the second expression, which is a Laurent polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since the second polynomial doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the first polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's equivalent to multiplying the coefficient from the first part by the sum of the coefficients in the second part. So, that again gives 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the second polynomial is being multiplied by the first, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second polynomial evaluated at \\(c = 1\\), which is the sum of its coefficients. So, that again gives 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm not making a mistake here. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). Then, the product P(a, b) * Q(c) would have terms where each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in P would be multiplied by each term in Q, which are terms involving \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that means we're summing over all possible coefficients from Q when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in Q. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but maybe I should approach it differently. Let me consider the entire expansion. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand each part separately and then see how the terms combine. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), as I did before, has a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). Now, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are terms involving \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent, that means we're summing over all the coefficients from the second expansion when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), as before. So, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in the first part, and when multiplied by each term in the second part, which is a Laurent polynomial in \\(c\\), it results in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in effect, we're summing all the coefficients from the second part because each term in the second part contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part. Therefore, the total coefficient is indeed 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the product of the coefficients from each part because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second. So, the coefficient would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the entire second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient, not the actual expression, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{2}{2} = 1\\), and the sum of coefficients in the second part is \\( (1 + 1) = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Let's check that: \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\). Multiplying them gives \\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which when considering the coefficient without \\(c\\) terms, we'd set \\(c = 1\\), so it's 2. So, that works. Therefore, in our original problem, the coefficient should indeed be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and when multiplied by the entire second part, each term in the second part just scales the coefficient. Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think I've thought this through enough, and all the approaches point to the same answer. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would contribute factors that might include \\(c^0\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that's a constant term, i.e., \\(c^0\\). Because when we multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a constant with respect to \\(c\\), the only way to get a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is to multiply by the constant term from the second expansion.

Let me check that logic again. So, the product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanding, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that would actually not be the case. Wait, no, because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, perhaps it's just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, when we multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because any other power of \\(c\\) would make the term not just \\(a^2b^2\\), but \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), which isn't what we want. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, let's compute that. First, we already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do that, we can use the binomial theorem again. Let me write that out. \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me double-check. So, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).

    "text": " Wait, no, that might not be correct. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial multiplies each term in the second polynomial. But in this case, since the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a separate expression, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the product would be a polynomial in four variables: \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that can't be right either because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\). Hmm, I'm getting confused here. Let me think again. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is just the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me check the problem again: it says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, I think the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is being considered in the entire product, but the coefficient would include the contribution from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all those products. But wait, no, that's not right either because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has its own coefficient, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But actually, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me check that again. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) which gives me \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and then I multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, each of these terms would be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times each of these coefficients, but that would result in a sum of all these terms. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but it doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) term. That is, it's considering \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, as I thought earlier, the sum of the coefficients is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. But let me make sure that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. In that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6. So, let me see. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 20, which is 120. That makes more sense because the problem is probably asking for the coefficient when considering the entire product, but only for the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, leaving a constant term. So, I think the correct answer is 120. Let me recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.

But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, right? Because if the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, then the term is a constant with respect to \\(c\\), so when we multiply it by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains part of the coefficient. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense. So, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me use the binomial theorem again for this part. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).

Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients from each expansion. So, that's 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, let me just double-check that I didn't miss anything. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\\).

Solving for \\(m\\), \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).
