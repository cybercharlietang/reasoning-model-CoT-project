    "text": " \n\nFirst, let me break down the problem. It looks like the expression is a product of two binomial expansions. The first part is \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think I can handle each part separately and then combine them.\n\nStarting with the first binomial: \\((a + b)^4\\). I remember that when expanding a binomial like \\((x + y)^n\\), each term is given by the binomial theorem, which is \\(\\dbinom{n}{k}x^{n - k}y^{k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(n\\). So in this case, \\(x = a\\), \\(y = b\\), and \\(n = 4\\).\n\nI need the term where the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would be when \\(k = 2\\) because the exponent of \\(b\\) is \\(k\\), and the exponent of \\(a\\) is \\(4 - k\\). So, plugging into the binomial formula, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). That means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder how this relates to finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, actually, I think I might be confused here. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables. So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times whatever the constant term is in the second expansion? Because if I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by something else, the \\(c\\) terms would still be there. Hmm, but the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms.\n\nWait, let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand both, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider that term in the first expansion and see how it interacts with the second expansion.\n\nSpecifically, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion because multiplying by \\(c^0\\) (which is 1) won't change the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. If I multiply by any other power of \\(c\\), it would change the term to something like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't what we're looking for. So, I need the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nTo find the constant term, I can again use the binomial theorem. Let's let \\(x = c\\) and \\(y = \\dfrac{1}{c}\\), and \\(n = 6\\). The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\).\n\nSo, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Let me compute it again. \\(6! = 720\\), \\(3! = 6\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that's correct. So the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion, when multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second expansion, gives \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2 = 120a^2b^2\\). So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me double-check the calculations. \n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\): the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nThen, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\): to find the constant term, set the exponent of \\(c\\) to 0. So, in the general term \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\times c^{-k}\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). Setting \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Then, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). That's correct.\n\nSo, multiplying the two coefficients: 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", but in the entire product, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all the products where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion? But no, because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by, say, \\(c^k\\), then the term becomes \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\) anymore. So, the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) is when it's multiplied by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I expand both parts fully. The first part will have terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), \\(b^4\\). The second part will have terms involving various powers of \\(c\\), but when I multiply them together, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(6a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by the constant term from the second part, which is 20. So, yes, that gives \\(6 * 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two expansions, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion and the constant term in the second expansion. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me think about whether there's any other way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. For example, if I take a higher power of \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) from the first expansion and multiply by something from the second expansion, but since the second expansion only has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and multiplying by the constant term from the second expansion. So, yes, 120 is the correct coefficient.\n\nSo, I think I've got it. The coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   - Using the binomial theorem, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is given by \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\).\n   - Calculating the binomial coefficient: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\).\n   - Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   - We need the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product.\n   - Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n   - Setting the exponent of \\(c\\) to 0: \\(6 - 2k = 0 \\Rightarrow k = 3\\).\n   - Calculating the binomial coefficient: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n   - Therefore, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\n3. **Combining the results**:\n   - The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from the two expansions: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((x + y)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that each term in the expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{n}{k}x^{n - k}y^k\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to \\(n\\). So maybe I can apply this theorem to both parts of the given expression separately.\n\nLet me start with the first part, which is \\((a + b)^4\\). Applying the binomial theorem here, each term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\). I'm specifically looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). \n\nCalculating the binomial coefficient for that term: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). I know that \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. \n\nAlright, so I've handled the first part. Now, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to expand this as well. Again, using the binomial theorem, each term will be \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\), where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. \n\nWait, but how does this affect the exponents? Let me simplify that term. \\(\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = c^{-m}\\), so the term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nHmm, but I'm not sure how this relates to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term yet. Wait, actually, the second part is multiplied by the first part, so when I multiply the two expansions together, I might get cross terms. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to consider all the terms in the second expansion. \n\nWait, hold on. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So when I multiply these two expansions, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), maybe I can treat the two parts separately.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first part, and the second part will contribute some other terms, but when multiplied together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's just the coefficient from the first part, and the second part doesn't affect it? \n\nWait, no, that can't be right because the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would involve multiplying by each term from the second expansion. But actually, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some exponent \\(k\\), which isn't what we want. \n\nWait, hold on, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me clarify: The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But actually, no, because the entire expression is a product, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would then include terms with \\(c\\). \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So maybe the problem is considering the entire expression as a single polynomial, and we need the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So in other words, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the entire second expansion, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself (without considering \\(c\\)) would be the sum of all those coefficients. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right either.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). So when you multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression, which includes all the \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), so unless the second part somehow cancels out the \\(c\\) terms, but that's not the case.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. That would make more sense because then we can consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. So perhaps the problem is implicitly asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\).\n\nIf that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, then multiply them together.\n\nSo let's proceed under that assumption. So first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier.\n\nNow, for the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. Using the binomial theorem, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\), as I derived earlier. So we want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). \n\nSo the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the product of the two coefficients we found, we multiply 6 and 20 together. So 6 times 20 is 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). \n\nIn the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), so the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{6 - 6} = 20c^0 = 20\\). \n\nMultiplying these together, \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 120a^2b^2\\). So yes, the coefficient is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't consider the \\(c^0\\) term and just multiplied the entire second expansion by the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the entire second expansion, but that would result in terms with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), each with coefficients 6 times the coefficients from the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), it must be referring to the constant term in the second expansion. So my initial approach was correct.\n\nI think that's solid. So the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, then multiplying them together.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   - The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\).\n   - Coefficient: 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   - Each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n   - To find the constant term (\\(c^0\\)), set \\(6 - 2m = 0 \\Rightarrow m = 3\\).\n   - Coefficient: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   - \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " I'm a bit confused because there are two variables, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another expression involving \\(c\\).

But wait, the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, since \\(c\\) doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\nLet me verify that. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by something that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will indeed be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire second expression. So, I can compute the coefficient from the first part and then multiply it by the sum from the second part.\n\nOkay, so let's start with \\((a + b)^4\\). To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can use the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^k\\). In this case, \\(x = a\\), \\(y = b\\), and \\(n = 4\\). So the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), because \\(y^k = b^2\\) when \\(k = 2\\).\n\nCalculating the binomial coefficient: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\).

I need to figure out what this expands to, but since I'm only concerned with the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), I might not need to compute the entire expansion. Wait, but actually, the entire second part is a scalar multiple when multiplied by the first part, so the coefficient from the first part will be multiplied by the entire second expression. But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because each term in the expansion of the second part is a term involving \\(c\\), but when we multiply by the first part, each term in the product will be a combination of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second.\n\nWait, but actually, since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think I might need to consider the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all terms in the second part. Wait, but the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the product will be a term from the first expansion times a term from the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which occurs in \\((a + b)^4\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, that can't be right because each term in the second part is a separate term, so actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to realize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply by a scalar, the coefficients get scaled by that scalar. But in this case, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) isn't a scalar; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). So actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we can consider the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and sum all its coefficients, because each term in the expansion will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part. Wait, but that's not quite right because each term in the second expansion is a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term will contribute a different power of \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by evaluating the polynomial at \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. In this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second polynomial, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will contribute a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we can sum all the coefficients from the second polynomial and multiply by the coefficient from the first part.\n\nSo, yes, that makes sense. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed found by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms in the first polynomial that multiply to give that specific term, and similarly for the second polynomial. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the terms in the second polynomial that multiply to give \\(a^2b^2\\) are all the terms in the second polynomial, because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, each term in the second polynomial will contribute its coefficient to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the total coefficient is indeed the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct by considering a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{2}{2} = 1\\), and the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\) is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(1 \\times 2 = 2\\). Let me expand it manually: \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c)\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\). Multiplying them together, we get \\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\). The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from \\(a^2 \\times 1/c \\times b^2 \\times c\\), but wait, that's not exactly right. Wait, actually, no, because \\(a^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but \\(b^2\\) is also multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) would require multiplying \\(a^2\\) from the first part and \\(b^2\\) from the first part, but wait, no, that's not how it works. Wait, actually, in the product, each term is a product of a term from the first polynomial and a term from the second. So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), you have to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, but the first part only goes up to \\(b^2\\), so the terms in the first part are \\(a^2\\), \\(2ab\\), and \\(b^2\\). So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by taking \\(a^2\\) from the first part and \\(b^2\\) from the second part, but the second part doesn't have \\(b^2\\); it has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Wait, so actually, in this simpler example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no \\(b^2\\) term in the second part. Wait, that contradicts my earlier reasoning. So, perhaps my earlier approach was wrong.\n\nWait, this means that my initial assumption was incorrect. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product isn't simply the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients from the second part. Instead, it's the coefficient from the first part times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, because only the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but in the problem, we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, each term in the product will have some power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will give a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we can sum all the coefficients from the second part and multiply by the coefficient from the first part.\n\nWait, but in my simpler example, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no \\(b^2\\) term in the second part. But according to the earlier reasoning, the sum of coefficients in the second part is 2, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 1 * 2 = 2, which is incorrect because the actual coefficient is zero. So, my initial approach must be wrong.\n\nHmm, this means I need to rethink my approach. So, perhaps the correct way is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but when considering the entire product, each term in the product will be a combination of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we can take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in the expansion will contribute a coefficient to the term \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by 6. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, in my simpler example, this approach gave the wrong answer. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me check again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term will have some power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all coefficients from the second part multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. But in the simpler example, this approach gave 2, whereas the actual coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present in the product. Wait, that can't be. Wait, no, in the product \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the terms are \\(a^2c\\), \\(a^2 \\times 1/c\\), \\(2ab \\times c\\), \\(2ab \\times 1/c\\), \\(b^2c\\), and \\(b^2 \\times 1/c\\). There is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term because \\(a^2b^2\\) would require multiplying \\(a^2\\) from the first part and \\(b^2\\) from the second part, but the second part doesn't have a \\(b^2\\) term. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed zero, which contradicts the earlier approach of multiplying by the sum of coefficients.\n\nSo, perhaps my initial approach was wrong. Maybe I need to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because only the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, each term in the product will have some power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all coefficients from the second part multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. But in the simpler example, this approach failed because the second part didn't have a \\(b^2\\) term. Wait, no, in the simpler example, the second part is \\((c + 1/c)\\), which doesn't have \\(b\\) at all, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is zero because there's no \\(b^2\\) term in the second part to multiply with \\(a^2\\) from the first part.\n\nWait, but in our original problem, the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which also doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the product will be a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we can sum all the coefficients from the second part and multiply by the coefficient from the first part.\n\nWait, but in the simpler example, this approach gave the wrong answer because the second part didn't have any \\(b\\) terms, so the product couldn't have any \\(a^2b^2\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient should be zero, but according to the approach, it would be 1 * 2 = 2, which is incorrect. So, perhaps the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because only the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. But in the problem, we're asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of it this way: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum over all possible exponents \\(k\\) of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) in the product. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's the sum of all coefficients of terms \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). Therefore, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\), and the coefficient is the product of the coefficients.\n\nSo, in the simpler example, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^2\\) times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\), which is 1 * 2 = 2. But when I expand it manually, I don't see an \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, that must mean that my manual expansion was wrong.\n\nWait, let me expand \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\) properly. \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). Multiplying by \\((c + 1/c)\\) gives:\n\n- \\(a^2 \\times c = a^2c\\)\n- \\(a^2 \\times 1/c = a^2/c\\)\n- \\(2ab \\times c = 2abc\\)\n- \\(2ab \\times 1/c = 2ab/c\\)\n- \\(b^2 \\times c = b^2c\\)\n- \\(b^2 \\times 1/c = b^2/c\\)\n\nSo, the product is \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). There is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term here, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero. But according to the earlier approach, it should be 1 * 2 = 2, which is wrong. So, my initial approach must be incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because only the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. But in the problem, we're asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, each term in the product will have some power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all coefficients from the second part multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. But in the simpler example, this approach failed because the second part didn't have any \\(b\\) terms, so the product couldn't have any \\(a^2b^2\\) terms. So, perhaps the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but only if the second part has terms that don't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, but in the simpler example, the second part doesn't have \\(b\\) terms, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero, which is correct. So, perhaps in the original problem, since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be 6 times 64, giving 384. But in the simpler example, this approach gave the wrong answer, so perhaps there's a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nWait, maybe the key is that in the original problem, the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply, each term in the second part is just a scalar multiple, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. But in the simpler example, the second part is \\((c + 1/c)\\), which doesn't involve \\(b\\), so when you multiply by \\((a + b)^2\\), you can't get an \\(a^2b^2\\) term because there's no \\(b\\) in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is zero, which contradicts the earlier approach. So, perhaps the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but only if the second part has terms that don't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), which they don't. So, in the original problem, since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but in the simpler example, the second part doesn't involve \\(b\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) should be zero, but according to the approach, it's 1 * 2 = 2, which is wrong. Therefore, my approach must be incorrect. So, perhaps the correct way is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because only the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the number of ways to choose 3 \\(c\\) terms and 3 \\(1/c\\) terms, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me check that. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), because we need to choose 3 terms of \\(c\\) and 3 terms of \\(1/c\\) to get \\(c^{3 - 3} = c^0\\). So, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut wait, in the simpler example, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\) is \\(\\dbinom{1}{0.5}\\), which doesn't make sense because you can't choose half a term. Wait, actually, in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\), the expansion is \\(c + 1/c\\), so there's no \\(c^0\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is zero, which would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 1 * 0 = 0, which matches the manual expansion. So, perhaps this is the correct approach.\n\nTherefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, which would give 6 * 64 = 384. But in the simpler example, using the sum of coefficients approach gave the wrong answer, while using the \\(c^0\\) coefficient approach gave the correct answer. Therefore, the correct approach is to multiply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part.\n\nSo, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), because each term in the expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{k} (1/c)^{6 - k}\\) = \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{2k - 6}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(2k - 6 = 0\\) => \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nSo, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, which would give 6 * 64 = 384. But in the simpler example, using the sum of coefficients approach gave the wrong answer, while using the \\(c^0\\) approach gave the correct answer. Therefore, the correct approach is to use the \\(c^0\\) coefficient.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean we need to consider all possible powers of \\(c\\), or only the term where \\(c^0\\)?\n\nI think the confusion arises from whether the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), or the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). If it's the former, then it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\), which would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of coefficients in the second part. If it's the latter, then it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part.\n\nLooking back at the problem statement: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, it's the sum of all coefficients of terms where the variables are \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut in the simpler example, this approach gave the wrong answer because the second part didn't have any \\(b\\) terms, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) should be zero, but according to this approach, it's 1 * 2 = 2, which is incorrect. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but the problem statement doesn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I'm confused. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't mention \\(c\\), so it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is the sum of all coefficients of terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut in the simpler example, this approach gave the wrong answer, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would make the answer 120. To clarify, let me consider the standard interpretation. When a problem asks for the coefficient of a term in a product of polynomials, it's usually asking for the coefficient of that specific combination of variables, regardless of other variables. So, in this case, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut in the simpler example, this approach gave the wrong answer because the second part didn't have any \\(b\\) terms, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) should be zero, but according to this approach, it's 1 * 2 = 2, which is incorrect. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would make the answer 120, and the approach using the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, so the coefficient is 120. But I'm not sure. Given the problem statement, I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so the answer should be 384. However, in the simpler example, this approach gave the wrong answer, which suggests that perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), in which case the answer is 120.\n\nTo resolve this confusion, perhaps I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut in the simpler example, this approach gave the wrong answer, so perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this, and the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so the answer is 384.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Let me consider the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum over all \\(k\\) of (coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\)). Therefore, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied"

The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, in this case, since the exponent is 4, I can expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial coefficients.\n\nLet me write that out. The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) would be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\binom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\binom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\binom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\binom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\binom{4}{4}a^0b^4\n\\]\n\nCalculating the coefficients, I know that \\(\\binom{4}{0} = 1\\), \\(\\binom{4}{1} = 4\\), \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\), \\(\\binom{4}{3} = 4\\), and \\(\\binom{4}{4} = 1\\). So, the expansion becomes:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nAlright, so the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\). That means the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of these two expansions. Wait, but the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when we multiply these two expressions together, the variables from each part will multiply independently.\n\nThat means, when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, since we're only interested in the term \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient will just be the coefficient from the first part, right?\n\nWait, let me think again. Actually, when we multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to consider whether any terms in the second expansion will affect the coefficient.\n\nBut actually, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those terms will have different powers of \\(c\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) will be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Hmm, but that doesn't seem right because the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\), so when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second, but the coefficients add up only if the variables match. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), so the coefficient will be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion will contribute a factor that doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, that might not be correct.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify. When you have two separate variables, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in the first part, and \\(c\\) in the second part, the multiplication will result in terms that are products of terms from each part. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it will be the coefficient from the first part, \\(6\\), multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), all the terms in the second expansion will just multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, each contributing a coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me compute the sum of its coefficients. The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, that seems high. Let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), and the second factor is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a separate polynomial. So, when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient will indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but actually, no. Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those terms will contribute to different terms in the product. For example, \\(6a^2b^2 \\times c^6\\) will give \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), and \\(6a^2b^2 \\times c^5 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c}\\) will give \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), and so on. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6.\n\nWait, but that's not correct because each term in the second expansion is being multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), will contribute a term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, with a coefficient equal to the coefficient from the second expansion.\n\nTherefore, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times\\) (sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). As I calculated earlier, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the second expansion is multiplied as a whole, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the entire second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so it's not a single coefficient. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, each term will have powers of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, if I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then yes, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), then I would have to find the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion and multiply it by 6. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm by another approach. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanding this, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial and any term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64. So, 6*64=384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with a different approach. Let's compute the entire product and see. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), as we saw, has \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. Let's write that out:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, the expansion will have terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\), in steps of 2. The coefficients are the binomial coefficients: 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1.\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^0\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), etc.\n\nBut since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient will be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that, when multiplied by 6a^2b^2, adds to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nSo, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is, as calculated before, 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64 because when \\(c = 1\\), \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me compute the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. The expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficients are 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1. Adding these up: 1 + 6 = 7, 7 +15=22, 22+20=42, 42+15=57, 57+6=63, 63+1=64. Yes, that's correct. So, the sum of coefficients is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. So, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\n2. The entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I remember that when expanding expressions like \\((a + b)^n\\), we can use the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^{k}\\). So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would have terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\), each multiplied by a binomial coefficient.\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to expand the entire \\((a + b)^4\\) term, just the part that gives me \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let me figure out which term that is.\n\nIn the binomial expansion, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\). I want the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, I set \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, I need to figure out how this part affects the coefficient. Wait a second, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all. That means I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms when it comes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But actually, the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so when we multiply them, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut wait, no. The problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are separate from \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is simply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) part will be multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) part.\n\nBut wait, no. That would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is just a numerical coefficient, not involving \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), and then multiply that by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\).\n\nAh, that makes more sense. So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\).\n\nAlright, so let's break it down. First, as I found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do that, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\).\n\nSimplifying the exponents, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again.\n\nWait, 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720/(6*6) = 720/36 = 20. Yeah, that's correct. So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", but in the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nTherefore, I think I was correct initially that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). So, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me think about it another way. If I consider the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when I expand it, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^{k} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe are looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, so \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNow, for the \\(c\\) part, we have \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where \\(c^{6 - 2m} = c^0\\), so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the term is \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2c^0 = 120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the key was to realize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in each respective part, considering that the \\(c\\) terms don't interfere with the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Therefore, the final coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\). We need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. This occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponent, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is a product of two binomials raised to powers. The first part is \\((a + b)^4\\) and the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think I can handle each part separately and then combine them if needed.\n\nLet me start with the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). I remember that when expanding a binomial like \\((x + y)^n\\), we can use the binomial theorem, which states that each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{n}{k}x^{n - k}y^{k}\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to \\(n\\). So, applying this to \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion will have terms like \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\).\n\nSince I'm interested in the term with \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find the value of \\(k\\) such that \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\) and \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). Solving \\(4 - k = 2\\), I get \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). This also looks like a binomial expansion, so I can use the binomial theorem here as well. The expansion will have terms of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{m}\\), where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6.\n\nSimplifying each term, \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, I need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because the original problem is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). That means I need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so solving for \\(m\\), I get \\(m = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient from the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check that calculation again.\n\nWait, 6! is 720, and 3! is 6. So, 6!/(3!3!) = 720/(6*6) = 720/36 = 20. Yes, that's correct. So, the coefficient is 20.\n\nNow, putting it all together, the original expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part with coefficient 6, and the term from the second part that is constant (with respect to \\(c\\)) is 20. \n\nSince these two parts are multiplied together, the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) (along with the constant term from the second part) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. I'm being asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. But since the second part is multiplied by the first, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The entire expression is a product of two expansions, so when I multiply them, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. However, since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find all the ways that multiplying terms from the two expansions can result in \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nBut in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first expansion, and the only term from the second expansion that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) is the constant term, which is 20. So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) (with coefficient 6) by 20, I get 120 \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe I should consider if there are other terms in the second expansion that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by terms from the first expansion. But since the second expansion only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), and the first expansion only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the variables are different. So, when you multiply them, the terms from the second expansion don't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is simply the product of the coefficients from each expansion, which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by expanding each part separately. Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. The constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives the final coefficient as 120.\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should break this down into two parts because the expression is a product of two binomials raised to powers. So, maybe I can find the coefficient separately for each part and then multiply them together. That makes sense because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply as well.\n\nLet me start with the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). I remember from the binomial theorem that \\((x + y)^n\\) expands to the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(n\\) of \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^k\\). So, applying that here, \\((a + b)^4\\) will have terms like \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\).\n\nI specifically need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let's see, if \\(a^2b^2\\) is the term, then \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\) and \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). So, substituting \\(k = 2\\) into the binomial coefficient, we get \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nOkay, now moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, this will expand to \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).\n\nSimplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m}\\) which is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, I need to find the coefficient of the term that doesn't have \\(c\\) in it because in the original problem, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) should be zero because \\(c^0 = 1\\), which is a constant term.\n\nSo, set the exponent equal to zero: \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Let me correct that: \\(6! = 720\\), but \\(3! = 6\\), so it's \\(\\dfrac{720}{(6)(6)} = 20\\). Yeah, that's correct.\n\nSo, the coefficient from the second part is 20.\n\nNow, since the original expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms multiply. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term from the second part will be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. But in this case, we're specifically looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). However, in the second part, we're looking for the constant term, which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, when we multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expression by the constant term from the second expression, the result is \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nBut wait, let me check my calculations again to be thorough. For the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, correct. For the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), correct.\n\nTherefore, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't overlook anything, let me think again. The original problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). We're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) is in the second, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and the constant term from the second part. There's no other way because if you take any term with \\(c\\) from the second part, it would introduce \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) into the product, which isn't present in \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, that makes sense.\n\nTherefore, I think my answer is correct: the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break it down into two parts and use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **First part: \\((a + b)^4\\)**\n   - Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\).\n   - The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\).\n   - The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**\n   - Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n   - We need the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero: \\(6 - 2m = 0 \\Rightarrow m = 3\\).\n   - The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Combining the coefficients**\n   - The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is 6.\n   - The constant term from the second part is 20.\n   - Multiplying these coefficients gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression raised to a power like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^{k}\\). So, maybe I can use that here.\n\nLooking at the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), I can expand this using the binomial theorem. Let me write that out:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\n\\]\n\nI need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I should find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, substituting \\(k = 2\\) into the binomial coefficient:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nWait, but the original problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider both expansions multiplied together. Hmm, but I'm only asked about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Does that mean I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms? Or do I need to consider how the \\(c\\) terms might affect the coefficient?\n\nWait, no, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), right? Because the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, when I multiply these two expansions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part. But since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it will just be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion, because the second expansion doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms to affect the exponents.\n\nWait, that might not make sense. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, you're multiplying each term from the first expansion by each term from the second expansion. So, if I take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, it will be multiplied by every term from the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the same as the coefficient in the first part because the second part doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient would just be 6 multiplied by whatever comes from the second part, but since it's just a constant multiplier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all the terms in the second expansion. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a separate part. So, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, if I have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part with coefficient 6, and I multiply it by the entire second expansion, which is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire second expansion. But that can't be right because the second expansion isn't a constant.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms involving \\(c\\) raised to various powers, but none of them will affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, when you multiply the two expansions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are numerical values, not expressions involving variables.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering that the second part might contribute to the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), but I don't think so because the second part only involves \\(c\\). So, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are independent of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion, but that's not a numerical coefficient. Hmm, I'm confused.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, maybe the problem is considering the entire product and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, we're looking for all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponents of \\(c\\) can be anything. But since we're only asked for the coefficient, perhaps it's just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, but that's not correct because the second expansion isn't being multiplied in a way that affects \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion with coefficient 6 will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which has a coefficient. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But that's not right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of each term in the second expansion, but that would give the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by all the \\(c\\) terms.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. The problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes a term like \\(6 \\times \\text{coefficient} \\times a^2b^2c^k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the sum of its coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\), right? Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives the sum of the coefficients.\n\nSo, let me calculate the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion by substituting \\(c = 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\nSo, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm wrong, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times each coefficient from the second expansion, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but that seems correct. Let me think again. When you have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the expansion will have terms like \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so \\(k=2\\). Then, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for each \\(m\\), but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we have to sum over all possible \\(m\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the second part is separate, so the coefficient is just 6, but that doesn't make sense because when you multiply by the second expansion, each term is scaled by the coefficients from the second expansion. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with a simpler example to see if this makes sense. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding this, we get:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) is also \\(c + 1/c\\). But if I were to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the product, it would be \\(c + 1/c\\), which is the same as the coefficient from the second expansion times the coefficient from the first part. So, in this case, the coefficient is 1 (from \\(a + b\\)) times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 2, so 1*2=2. But in reality, the coefficient is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is not a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps my approach is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient in the sense of the numerical coefficient, ignoring the \\(c\\) terms. So, if we're considering the entire expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. But in the simple example, that approach would give 1*2=2, but the actual coefficient is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is not a number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient in the sense of the numerical coefficient, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion, which is not a number. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power. Because otherwise, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would involve all the \\(c\\) terms, which isn't a single number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion.\n\nSo, let's try that. The second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when the exponents from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out. So, in the binomial expansion, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nBut the problem as stated is: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. However, in the simple example, this approach leads to a non-numerical coefficient, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, perhaps the problem is implicitly asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as independent variables, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all possible \\(c\\) exponents, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion, which is 384. But in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are numerical. So, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's expecting the coefficient as a polynomial in \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so that can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by all possible powers of \\(c\\), but that would still not be a numerical value. So, perhaps the problem is miswritten, or I'm misinterpreting it. Alternatively, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering that the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so the coefficient is just 6. But that seems too simple, and I think the problem is more likely expecting 120, considering the \\(c^0\\) term.\n\nWait, to clarify, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, which are terms involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first expansion (which is 6) multiplied by each coefficient from the second expansion, leading to terms like \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for each \\(m\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{k}\\) would be \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\) where \\(k = 6 - 2m\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's the sum of all \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for all \\(m\\), which is 6 times the sum of binomial coefficients, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut in the simple example, this approach would give 1 * 2 = 2, but the actual coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which isn't a number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that doesn't make sense because coefficients are numerical.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6, because the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). But that seems too simplistic, and I think the problem is expecting a more involved answer, considering the entire product.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at the problem differently. Let me consider that the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider that each term in the expansion is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the second expansion, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a numerical value. So, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120.\n\nYes, I think that's the correct approach. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering only the terms where \\(c^0\\), is 120.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together to get 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the final coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

I have two binomials multiplied together: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but hold on, the second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So does that mean that the terms involving \\(c\\) might affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, maybe not directly because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So perhaps I can treat each part separately and then multiply the coefficients? Let me think.\n\nSo, if I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), the general term will be something like \\(\\binom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\). Similarly, when I expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the general term will be \\(\\binom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\binom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWait, but the question is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when the exponents add up to 4, right? So, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be when \\(k = 2\\), because \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\) and \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). So, the coefficient here would be \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. That part I think I got.\n\nNow, the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient of some term here that, when multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, would still result in a term with \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, so unless the problem is asking for a term that also involves \\(c\\) in a specific way, I might not need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms when looking for \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, let me reread the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the entire expression is a product of two expansions. So, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps any terms involving \\(c\\) would just multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, but since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second expansion. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), which don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the second expansion would contribute a sum, not a single coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we're to consider the entire product. So, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only come from the product where the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by a term that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Wait, but \\(c\\) is a separate variable, so perhaps any term in the second expansion is just a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\).\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Perhaps it's actually \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which would be the constant term from the second expansion. That makes more sense because then the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product, which would involve finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, then multiplying them together.\n\nLet me check that. If that's the case, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\), as I thought earlier. Now, for the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. How do I find that?\n\nIn the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is \\(\\binom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\binom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the term is \\(\\binom{6}{3}c^{0}\\), which is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product would be the product of the coefficients from each expansion, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by the constant term \\(c^0\\) in the second part, giving \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1\\), so the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but that wouldn't make sense because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. So, I think my initial approach is correct.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The general term is \\(\\binom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\binom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when is \\(6 - 2m = 0\\)? When \\(m = 3\\). So, the term is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\), correct. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is indeed 20.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, so the overall coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is the problem asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms? If so, then yes, it's 120. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it would be 6 times the entire expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a number. So, I think the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but in that case, the coefficient would be a sum involving \\(c\\) terms, but that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical answer.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is the product of the coefficients from each part. But that would mean that the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is not a number. So, that can't be right.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and the question is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each expansion, which is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we're to consider the entire expansion, and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as a variable. But in that case, the coefficient would be a sum involving \\(c\\) terms, but that seems odd because the problem is likely expecting a numerical answer.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that when the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", it's only referring to the part with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the \\(c\\) terms are just part of the expression. But that doesn't make sense because the entire expression includes \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would involve those as well.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it this way: when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which are all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second expansion, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, without considering the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. But that would be 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), which is 384. But that doesn't make sense because the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), so 6 times 64 is 384. But that seems too large, and I don't think that's what the problem is asking.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to approach it differently. Let me expand both expressions separately and see how they multiply.\n\nFirst, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNext, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term is \\(\\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6 a^2b^2 \\times \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Wait, but that would give us \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, unless we're looking for a specific term in \\(c\\), like \\(c^0\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be that polynomial, which doesn't seem right because the problem is probably expecting a numerical answer.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion.\n\nAs I calculated earlier, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nBut let me double-check that. If I'm looking for the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then yes, it's the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and the constant term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical value.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, and it's actually \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). That would make sense, and the answer would be 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the entire product, and we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), considering all possible \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems odd because the problem is probably expecting a number.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating again. Let me think: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply together to give that specific term. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product can only come from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if it's multiplied by a term that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), which is any term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times\\) (sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)).\n\nThe sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, setting \\(c = 1\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier conclusion of 120. Hmm, now I'm confused. Which approach is correct?\n\nWait, let me clarify: when we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, we're considering all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. So, each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems odd because the problem is likely expecting a numerical answer.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120, as I calculated earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\"\n\nSo, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without specifying any condition on \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical value, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to have the entire product, and we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is mistyped, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^{10}\\) or something similar, but that's just me guessing.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is likely expecting a numerical answer, so perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120, as I calculated earlier. That seems more plausible because it's a numerical answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is written correctly, and I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, which would mean that the coefficient is a sum of products of coefficients from each expansion, but only considering the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\), as I thought earlier.\n\nI think that's the correct approach because if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's implied that we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), so the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, let me try to confirm this by considering a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we have \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, but that's a different case. Alternatively, if I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^0\\), then it's \\((a + b)^2 \\times 1\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because that term doesn't exist. Hmm, maybe that's not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of the problem as a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part, but that's not correct because the second part is a sum, not a single term.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making this more complicated than it needs to be. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times\\) (sum of coefficients in the second expansion).\n\nThe sum of coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 120, so which is it?\n\nWait, let's clarify: when you have two polynomials, \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), the coefficient of a term in \\(P(a, b)\\) when multiplied by \\(Q(c)\\) is the coefficient in \\(P\\) times the entire polynomial \\(Q(c)\\). So, if you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it's \\(6 \\times Q(c)\\), which is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a number.\n\nHowever, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(Q(c)\\), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nGiven that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying anything about \\(c\\), it's ambiguous. But in most problems like this, unless specified, I think they're asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nWait, but I'm still confused because depending on the interpretation, it could be 384 or 120. Let me try to see which one makes more sense.\n\nIf I consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 384, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nBut if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120, because we're specifically looking for the term where \\(c^0\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nGiven that the problem is written as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without any mention of \\(c\\), I think the intended answer is 120, because it's looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, I think the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me try to compute both possibilities.\n\nFirst, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire second expansion, which is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That's a polynomial, but the problem is likely expecting a numerical answer, so that can't be it.\n\nSecond, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 times 20, which is 120. That's a number, so that must be the intended answer.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 120.\n\nWait, let me just confirm once more. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20, so the product is 6 times 20, which is 120. So, yes, 120 is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is likely what the problem is asking for.\n\nI think I've thought this through enough, and I'm confident that the answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts: expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) and expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   The general term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   We need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\binom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The general term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), i.e., \\(m = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\binom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, in this case, for \\((a + b)^4\\), I can write it as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\).\n\nNow, I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me check: if \\(k = 2\\), then \\(4 - 2 = 2\\), so the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2 b^2\\).

So, perhaps I need to consider whether the \\(c\\) terms affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But actually, since they are separate variables, the \\(c\\) terms won't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, maybe I can treat the two parts separately.\n\nWait, but when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, that seems confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would just be \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\).\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all possible terms from the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right either because each term in the second expansion has a different power of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each would contribute a different term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. That can't be right because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a number.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating the entire expression as a single polynomial. But since the product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when you expand it, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term from the second part, which are terms involving different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nBut wait, let me check that again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 from the first part, and when you multiply it by each term in the second part, each of those terms has a coefficient. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion would be 6 times each coefficient. Therefore, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all terms would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. In that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the constant term, and then multiply that by 6.\n\nLet me try that approach. To find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, now I'm confused. Which interpretation is correct? Is the problem asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384, or is it asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120?\n\nLet me re-examine the problem statement: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" The way it's phrased, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any condition on \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion, each of which has a different power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, that seems too large. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the monomial \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. If the problem had said \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)\", then it would be 120. But as it is, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think it's 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it would be \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be 1 * (c + 1/c), which is a polynomial, not a number. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the original problem would be a polynomial, not a number, unless we're considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\).\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a number.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. That seems more likely because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial, which is not a single number.\n\nLet me try to confirm. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^k b^{4 - k} c^m\\), where \\(k\\) is from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) is determined by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2 b^2 \\times \\text{something}\\). The \"something\" is the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Because if it were asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it would probably specify that it's considering the expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) separately, but that's not the case here.\n\nWait, but let's think about how the problem is written. It's written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, you get a product where each term is a combination of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by every term from the second expansion, which includes different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut that seems like a lot. Alternatively, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120. I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so the answer would be 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it's \\(a \\times c + a \\times 1/c + b \\times c + b \\times 1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\). So, if I were to ask for the coefficient of \\(a\\) in that product, it's \\(c + 1/c\\). But if I were to ask for the coefficient of \\(a c^0\\), that would be 1, because \\(a \\times 1/c\\) is \\(a c^{-1}\\), which isn't \\(a c^0\\). Wait, no, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a c^0\\) would be the coefficient where the power of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), the term \\(a \\times 1/c\\) is \\(a c^{-1}\\), and \\(a \\times c\\) is \\(a c^1\\). There is no \\(a c^0\\) term, so the coefficient would be zero. But that's not the case here.\n\nWait, perhaps in our original problem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by terms from the second expansion, which can have different powers of \\(c\\). So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that would be 6 * 20 = 120, as I calculated earlier. But if we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120, because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial, which doesn't make sense in this context. So, I'll go with 120 as the answer.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure. Let me think about how the product works. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number. So, unless we're considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120, the answer would be a polynomial, which doesn't make sense.\n\nTherefore, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, if we're considering the coefficient as a polynomial, it's 6 times that expansion. But if we're considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's the correct approach. So, the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 from the first part. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply 6 by each of those terms, you get terms like \\(6c\\), \\(6c^{-1}\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, so 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. Therefore, the answer is 120.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Since the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut that contradicts my earlier conclusion. So, which is it?\n\nI think the confusion comes from whether the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\) or specifically \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Since the problem doesn't specify, I think it's more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Because if it were asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it would probably mention that it's considering the expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) separately, but it's not.\n\nWait, but in reality, when you have multiple variables, the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) would include all possible powers of the other variables. So, in this case, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense as a single coefficient. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nYes, I think that's the correct interpretation. So, the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^{k}\\). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLooking at \\((a + b)^4\\), I think the expansion will have terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\). Specifically, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from when \\(k = 2\\) in the binomial expansion because \\(n - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). \n\nSo, let me write that out. The coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. That part seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to figure out how this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first part, and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\). So, maybe these two parts are multiplied together, meaning that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut hold on, the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the entire expansion would include various terms of \\(c\\), but we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply them together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\).\n\nBut that seems odd because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps they just want the part that multiplies \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial in \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(c\\) isn't present in \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a single number. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but treating all variables as separate, so the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's not a numerical coefficient. Hmm, maybe I need to re-express the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because if you consider the product, the \\(c\\) terms will affect the exponent of \\(c\\), so maybe the question is implicitly asking for the coefficient where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\), so that the term is \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). That would make more sense because then the coefficient would be a number.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to interpret the problem as finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me check that.\n\nIf that's the case, then I can proceed by first finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I found earlier, and then multiply that by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's compute that.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but the problem as stated was: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, if they're only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), without considering \\(c\\), then perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because coefficients are numerical.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct interpretation is that they're asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1.

But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a number.\n\nTherefore, I think the intended question is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20.\n\n3. Multiply these coefficients together: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients.\n\nFor \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed when k=2, so \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). That's correct.\n\nFor \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(c^0\\) is when the exponent is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so k=3. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).

The binomial theorem says that each term in the expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{n}{k}a^{n - k}b^k\\), where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to \\(n\\). So, maybe I can apply that here for both parts of the expression.\n\nLet me start by looking at \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion will have terms like \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\). I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I should find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), so \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). \n\nCalculating the coefficient for this term: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). I think \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to expand this as well, but wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But this part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Hmm, so does this mean that the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Or do I need to consider something else?\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the other variables. So, perhaps I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion.\n\nBut since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term will come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion and any term from the second expansion. However, the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the other variables won't affect it. That is, the coefficient will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion, but since the second expansion is a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\), each term in the second expansion is a constant coefficient when considering the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\nWait, that might not make sense. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand this, each term will be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in the factors. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first factor, and \\(c\\) is only in the second, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first factor by any term from the second factor, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not any specific power of \\(c\\), we need to consider how the second expansion contributes to the coefficient.\n\nWait, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but that doesn't sound right because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be when we set \\(c = 1\\), right? Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives the sum of all coefficients. So, if I calculate \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product comes from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), we can consider that each term in the second expansion contributes its own coefficient, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the other variables. So, in that case, since the second factor is multiplied as a whole, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second factor. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem statement says only \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering the entire product, and the coefficient would just be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, as I thought earlier. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me think differently. Maybe I need to consider that when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's like the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire second expansion, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. But the problem asks for the coefficient, which should be a number, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms. So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's like summing over all possible \\(k\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nSo, as I thought earlier, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check this another way. Let's consider the entire product:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\n\\]\n\nExpanding each part separately:\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nSecond, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply the two expansions together, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}\\).\n\nBut the sum of the binomial coefficients \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}\\) is equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384.\n\nAlternatively, let me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe I can consider the entire expression as a product and find the coefficient directly.\n\nBut no, I think the method I used is correct. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of coefficients from the second part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I remember that when you expand a binomial like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can use the binomial theorem, which states that each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{n}{k}a^{n - k}b^k\\). So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion will have terms like \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4.\n\nSince the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I should find the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. That means I need to find the value of \\(k\\) such that \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\) and \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). Solving \\(4 - k = 2\\) gives \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nLet me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6.\n\nNow, looking at the entire expression, it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I need to consider the expansion of that part as well. But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part. The second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient related to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), maybe the second part just contributes a constant factor? Or does it affect the coefficient?\n\nWait, let me think again. The expression is a product of two binomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So when we multiply them out, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut the problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term in the first part is \\(6a^2b^2\\), as we found earlier. Now, when we multiply this by the entire expansion of the second part, each term in the second expansion will multiply this \\(6a^2b^2\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the other part (the one with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\)) might not affect the coefficient we're looking for. Wait, no, actually, it might just multiply the coefficient by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me clarify. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and when we multiply it by the entire second part, it will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will actually be \\(6\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number.\n\nWait, maybe I misunderstood the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, they might be treating \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) as separate variables, and they want the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be \\(6\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems like a polynomial, not a single coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power, so that the overall term is just a number multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). That would make sense. So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to do that. Again, using the binomial theorem, each term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that's not right. Wait, 6! is 720, but 3! is 6, so 6!/(3!3!) = 720/(6*6) = 720/36 = 20. Yes, that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as we found. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when we multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), that would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, but wait, no, that's not correct. Because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), but we're only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be 6 times the entire second expansion. But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a single number.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in the expansion will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's actually looking for the sum of all the coefficients that come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion. However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that seems odd because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a scalar.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, it's looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a single number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which is a term in \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in a binomial expansion is found by setting all variables to 1, so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high.\n\nWait, but that would be the case if we were looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any term in \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the product would have all the terms from the second expansion attached to it. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number.\n\nBut the problem is asking for \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which suggests that it's a scalar. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe it's actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a single number.\n\nIf that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, from the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and from the second part, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20, as we found earlier. So, multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), it just said \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again.\n\nWhen you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give the desired term. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is 6a^2b^2. When we multiply this by the second polynomial, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the second polynomial will be multiplied by 6a^2b^2. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a scalar.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 384.\n\nBut that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the entire expansion, every term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by some term involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually the sum over all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a separate factor, so the overall coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number.\n\nI'm getting confused here. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) as separate variables. So, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(C \\times a^k b^m c^n\\), and we need the coefficient where \\(k=2\\), \\(m=2\\), and \\(n=0\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) implies that \\(c\\) is to the zero power, as we discussed earlier.\n\nSo, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would be 6 * (c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6). But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a single coefficient.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but to be thorough, let me check this again. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when we multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the term 20 from the second part, giving 6 * 20 = 120 as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 120.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). We set the exponent to 0, so 6 - 2k = 0, which gives k = 3. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), which is correct.\n\nSo, yes, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not the sum.\n\nWait, but let's think about how the product works. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), and \\(1/c^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) would be 6 * 1 = 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) would be 6 * 6 = 36, and so on, down to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\) being 6 * 1 = 6.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all these terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the entire polynomial \\(6 \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\right)\\). Therefore, the coefficient isn't a single number but a polynomial. But the problem is asking for \"the coefficient\", which implies a single number, so I must have misinterpreted it.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. So, the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients of terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is the sum of 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought earlier.\n\nBut that seems high, and I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for similar problems or think about how coefficients work in products of polynomials. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms in each polynomial whose variables multiply to give the desired term. So, in this case, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to take the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and multiply it by each term in the second polynomial, which would contribute different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire second polynomial, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for \"the coefficient\", which is a single number, so perhaps it's only considering the constant term, i.e., the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial. But that doesn't seem to fit the wording of the problem, which is asking for \"the coefficient\", implying a single number.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's the intended interpretation.\n\nWait, let me try to see what happens if I compute the product. The first part is \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). Now, when I multiply these two, each term in the first will be multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(120a^2b^2\\), \\(90a^2b^2/c^2\\), \\(36a^2b^2/c^4\\), and \\(6a^2b^2/c^6\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120, which comes from the term \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20\\), which is the constant term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the middle term, which is \\(120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   We need the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power (\\(c^0\\)), which occurs when:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k} \\quad \\text{with} \\quad 6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   Multiply the coefficients from both expansions to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I remember that when expanding expressions like \\((x + y)^n\\), we can use the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^k\\). So maybe I can apply this theorem to both parts of the given expression separately.\n\nLet me start with the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). Applying the binomial theorem here, it should expand to:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n\\]\n\nI need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So I should find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That means I need to find \\(k\\) such that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So when \\(k = 2\\), the term is:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2} b^{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating the binomial coefficient, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is equal to \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to figure out how this part affects the coefficient. Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So does the second part affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) or not? Hmm, let me think.\n\nActually, since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), when we multiply the two expressions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), I think the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that might not be right.\n\nWait, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k \\times (1/c)^m\\), etc. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think I just need to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, because every term in the second expansion will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but that seems too straightforward.\n\nWait, no, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's not correct either because the entire product would be the sum over all possible combinations. Wait, no, I think I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So perhaps the problem is considering the product as a whole, and we're looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). So in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single coefficient. Hmm, that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm supposed to consider only the constant term in \\(c\\), so the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a single number.\n\nLet me check that. If that's the case, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nTo find the constant term, I can use the binomial theorem again. Let's expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\):\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\n\\]\n\nSo the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), which is 20, making the total coefficient 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering \\(c\\). So perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, giving 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) separately, and then multiply them together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, so perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire product and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are present, it's more likely that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). So that would make the coefficient 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering \\(c\\), so it's 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, but since \\(c\\) is not involved in \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which is not a single number. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, giving 120.\n\nWait, but to confirm, let's think about the entire expansion. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, so perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's not a single number. Therefore, I think the intended answer is 120, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\).\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20.\n3. Multiply these two to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives the final coefficient as 120.\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression raised to a power like \\((a + b)^4\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\).\n\nNow, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), when does \\(a^{4 - k} b^k\\) become \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me set up the equation: \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). That makes sense because \\(4 - 2 = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is the number of combinations of 4 things taken 2 at a time. The formula for combinations is \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} = \\dfrac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\\). Plugging in the numbers, we get \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part is 6.\n\nBut wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I also need to consider the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. In other words, when I multiply the two expansions together, the \\(c\\) terms will multiply with other terms, but since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, the coefficient from the \\(c\\) part can be considered as 1, because any term multiplied by 1 doesn't change its coefficient.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me think again. Actually, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by every term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to make sure that when I multiply a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) with a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term isn't affected by the \\(c\\) terms. That is, the \\(c\\) part can be any term, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms can be considered as multiplying by 1, so the coefficient from the \\(c\\) part doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term's coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient remains 6.\n\nBut wait, another thought: Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I can treat the two parts separately. The \\((a + b)^4\\) part gives the coefficient 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part, when expanded, will have multiple terms, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms can be considered as 1 for this purpose. So, the overall coefficient would just be 6 multiplied by 1, which is 6.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. Because actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by every term from the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be the sum of the products of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and each term from the second part. But since the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, that would be incorrect because each term in the second part has a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), we need to find the term in the second expansion that is a constant term, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.\n\nAh, that's it! So, I was wrong earlier. I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) because when I multiply it by \\(a^2b^2\\), the constant term will give me just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. The other terms would introduce \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which we don't want. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, let's first find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\) \u2192 \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, actually, 6! is 720, but 3! is 6, so 720/(6*6) is 720/36, which is indeed 20. So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the overall coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the constant term from the other expansion is 20, so multiplying them gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think through the entire expansion. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanded, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these, we get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is when we multiply by the constant term 20. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression raised to a power like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^k\\). So, maybe I can apply that here for both parts of the expression.\n\nLet me start with the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this expansion would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which means \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the value of \\(k\\) such that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). That makes sense because if \\(k = 2\\), then \\(4 - 2 = 2\\), so the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2\\).\n\nCalculating the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), I know that \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} = \\dfrac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\\). Plugging in the numbers: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm not sure if this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because it's in terms of \\(c\\), and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables. Hmm, maybe I need to consider how these two expressions interact when multiplied together.\n\nWait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand both parts, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to see if any terms from the second expansion will affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.\n\nBut hold on, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\). So, when I multiply them, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. However, since I'm only asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that means I just need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the entire second expression, because any term involving \\(c\\) would make it a different term, not just \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, if I expand both parts, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), I think the only way it can contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) is if it's multiplied by a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), i.e., the constant term in the second expansion. Because if it's multiplied by a term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the result will have \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which are different terms.\n\nSo, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me calculate that.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nI need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), I get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), that's \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original expression: the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part has a coefficient of 6, and it's multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in the first part, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in the second part, the constant term is 20. When you multiply them together, it's 6 * 20, which is indeed 120. So, the coefficient should be 120.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't miss anything, let me think about the structure of the entire expression. When you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. However, only the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) will result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms will have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) multiplied in, which would make them different terms like \\(a^2b^2c\\), \\(a^2b^2/c\\), etc. So, only the constant term contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nTherefore, my conclusion is that the coefficient is 120. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations, but let me verify the binomial coefficients again.\n\nFor the first part: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6. That's correct because 4 choose 2 is 6.\n\nFor the second part: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20. That's also correct because 6 choose 3 is 20.\n\nMultiplying them together: 6 * 20 = 120. Yep, that seems right.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by considering the expansion of each part separately. \n\n1. In \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nMultiplying these coefficients together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

The expression is a product of two binomials raised to powers: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I guess I need to focus on the first part because that's where the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms come from. The second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so maybe that won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term? Or maybe it does? Hmm, I'm not sure yet.\n\nLet me start by expanding \\((a + b)^4\\). I remember from the binomial theorem that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^k\\). So, applying that here, \\((a + b)^4\\) would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). \n\nI need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, in the binomial expansion, that would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) because \\(4 - k = 2\\) implies \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder if I need to consider this part when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times whatever the constant term is in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if I multiply the two parts together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but only the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) will contribute to a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not involving \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the entire product and look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), since the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\). So, perhaps I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part.\n\nLet me verify that. So, if I expand both parts, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part. But since the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), maybe I'm supposed to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because then the coefficient would involve terms with \\(c\\), which isn't part of the term \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. But that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), so it would only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part and the constant term in the second part. So, maybe I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6.\n\nLet me check that. So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Then, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me find that.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 * 6} = 20\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Let me compute it correctly: 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720/(6*6) is 720/36 = 20. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120 times \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the constant term in the second part is 20, so when you multiply them, you get 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so when you expand it, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, and to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, you have to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, but since the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), perhaps it's just the coefficient when considering the entire product, but only the term where the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out. Hmm, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables are separate, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the constant term (the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero) in the second part. So, that would be 6 * 20 = 120. So, that's consistent with what I thought earlier.\n\nLet me just double-check my calculations. The binomial coefficient for \\((a + b)^4\\) at \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), correct. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), correct. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem, which is 6. Then, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found to be 20. Multiplying these together gives the final coefficient as 120.\n\n$\\boxed{120}$"

Let me think.\n\nFirst, I'll focus on the first part of the expression: \\((a + b)^4\\). I remember that when expanding a binomial like \\((a + b)^n\\), we can use the binomial theorem, which says that each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^k\\), where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to \\(n\\).

So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, looking at the second part of the expression: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm a bit unsure how this part interacts with the first part since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), maybe their exponents don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? In other words, when multiplying the two expanded expressions together, the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) will multiply with the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient remains the same as in the first part?\n\nWait, let me make sure. When you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by every term from the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to consider if any terms from the second part can contribute to a term that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), results in another term that also has \\(a^2b^2\\). But since the second part only has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, the only way for a term from the second part to affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is if the second part contributes a term with \\(c^0\\), which is 1. Because multiplying by 1 doesn't change the term.\n\nSo, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. Wait, but actually, no, because the second part is raised to the 6th power, so maybe I need to consider the expansion of the second part as well.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The entire expression is the product of two expansions: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When you multiply them together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. However, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, we need to consider all the terms that result in \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by something from the second expansion. But since the second expansion only has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables, the only way for a term from the second expansion to affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is if it's a constant term, i.e., a term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because otherwise, the product would have \\(c\\) terms attached to it, which would make it a different term altogether.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part that result in \\(c^0\\). But wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, because each term is independent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part.\n\nWait, but the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in this expansion. Using the binomial theorem again, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20 \\times 1 = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(k = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when we multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, resulting in \\(20a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 20 times 6, which is 120.\n\nWait, but is that correct? Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanded, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and to get the overall coefficient, we need to multiply it by every term from the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only term from the second part that will contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) is the constant term, because multiplying by any other term would introduce \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would make the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or similar, which isn't what we're looking for.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), giving 120.\n\nWait, but let me consider an alternative approach. Maybe I can treat the entire expression as a product and think about how the coefficients combine. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum over all possible products of coefficients from each part that result in \\(a^2b^2\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part and \\(c\\) is in the second, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by the constant term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient is just the product of the two coefficients, which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by considering the expansion of each part separately. From \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient is 6. From \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst off, the expression is a product of two binomials raised to different powers. I remember that when you have something like \\((x + y)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that each term in the expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{n}{k}x^{n - k}y^{k}\\), where \\(\\dbinom{n}{k}\\) is the binomial coefficient, which can be found using combinations or Pascal's triangle.\n\nSo, looking at the first part of the expression, \\((a + b)^4\\), I can expand this using the binomial theorem. Let me write that out. The expansion will have terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\), each multiplied by their respective binomial coefficients.\n\nThe general term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\), where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. So, the terms are:\n\n- When \\(k = 0\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 = 1 \\cdot a^4\\)\n- When \\(k = 1\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 = 4a^3b\\)\n- When \\(k = 2\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\)\n- When \\(k = 3\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 = 4ab^3\\)\n- When \\(k = 4\\): \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4 = 1 \\cdot b^4\\)\n\nSo, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). Got that part down.\n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to expand this as well. Again, using the binomial theorem, each term will be \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\), where \\(m\\) goes from 0 to 6.\n\nSimplifying each term, we get:\n\n\\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\cdot c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\)\n\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). Let me write out all the terms:\n\n- When \\(m = 0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1 \\cdot c^6\\)\n- When \\(m = 1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^{4} = 6c^4\\)\n- When \\(m = 2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^{2} = 15c^2\\)\n- When \\(m = 3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20 \\cdot 1 = 20\\)\n- When \\(m = 4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- When \\(m = 5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- When \\(m = 6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1 \\cdot c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\).\n\nNow, the original expression is the product of these two expansions: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider how the multiplication works.\n\nWait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), right? So, when I multiply the two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will multiply each term from the second expansion. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can focus on the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and see how it interacts with the second expansion.\n\nBut hold on, the second expansion has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables. So, when we multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each product will have the form \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\text{(term from the second expansion)}\\).\n\nBut since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the presence of \\(a^2b^2\\) in a product term will only depend on the \\(6a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, right?\n\nWait, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply together to give that specific term.\n\nBut in this case, the specific term we're looking for is \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second expansion.\n\nBecause if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any other term from the second expansion, you'll end up with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), which are not \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) is when we multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nLooking back at the second expansion, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, is that right? Let me think again. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But only the term with \\(c^0\\) will result in a term that has just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms will have some power of \\(c\\), which we don't want. So, indeed, only the constant term from the second expansion will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nBut just to make sure I'm not making a mistake, let me double-check. Suppose I consider the entire product. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, and to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, we need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by 1 (the constant term) from the second expansion, right? Because any other term would introduce \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would make the term have those variables, which we don't want.\n\nSo, yes, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nAlternatively, if I were to think about it in terms of multiplying the entire expressions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of the coefficients in the second part that don't involve \\(c\\). But since only the constant term doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's just \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but actually, in the second expansion, all the terms have coefficients, but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), only the constant term will result in a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient is indeed \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nI think that's solid. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by multiplying the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should handle each part of the expression separately. That is, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) separately, and then see how they multiply together. But wait, actually, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to expand the entire expression. Maybe I can focus just on the parts that contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nLet me start by looking at \\((a + b)^4\\). I remember from the binomial theorem that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So for \\(n = 4\\), the expansion would be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}ab^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}b^4\n\\]\n\nCalculating the coefficients:\n\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} = 1\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} = 1\\)\n\nSo, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\). That means the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, this would be:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the exponent: \\(c^{6 - 2m} = c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nI notice that the exponent of \\(c\\) can be positive or negative depending on the value of \\(m\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe we need to consider how the two expansions multiply together.\n\nWait, actually, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So when we multiply these two expansions, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will multiply each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can consider the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by every term in the second expansion. However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), right?\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. Because when we multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term will have a different power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Hmm, wait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But in the entire expression, each term will have some combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So perhaps the problem is only concerned with the terms that have exactly \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but that might not be correct because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient and a power of \\(c\\). But since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps we need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because when we multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion, that will give us a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and no \\(c\\) terms. Any other terms from the second expansion will introduce \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so they won't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to do that.\n\nIn the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\), as I wrote earlier. The exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent is zero. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the constant term, which is indeed \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Then, since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, multiplying them gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. Since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), their product gives the desired term.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2 b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\) gives \\(m = 3\\). The constant term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."
