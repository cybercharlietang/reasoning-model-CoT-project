    "text": " I'm a bit rusty on combinatorics, but I think I can handle it.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), the expansion is done using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^{k}\\). So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), each term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4.\n\nNow, the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That means I should look for the term where \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, substituting \\(k = 2\\) into the binomial coefficient, we get \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6. That gives us the term \\(6a^2b^2\\).\n\nBut wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but it doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\). Hmm, does that mean I need to consider the entire expansion, or is there a specific term related to \\(c\\) that I should focus on?\n\nWait, no, I think I might be overcomplicating this. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, actually, when they ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), they are only concerned with the part of the expression that has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by the other expression, every term in the expansion will be multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient is 6 times whatever comes from the other part.\n\nWait, no, actually, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make much sense because the coefficients in the second expression are related to specific powers of \\(c\\), not just a scalar multiple.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). In other words, when you expand the entire expression, how many times does \\(a^2b^2\\) appear, considering all possible terms from the second part.\n\nBut that might not be the case. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has terms with various powers of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply these two, each term from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), meaning that in the final product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have coefficients that are multiples of 6, each multiplied by the corresponding term from the second expansion.\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the final product. However, in the final product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that is, the sum of all coefficients attached to \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut wait, that might not be the case. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, so that the term is just a scalar multiple of \\(a^2b^2\\). Because otherwise, if we consider all possible powers of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be a sum of terms, which might not be a single number.\n\nLet me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable. But in that case, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a scalar. So that can't be right because the question is expecting a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the entire expression includes \\(c\\) terms. Alternatively, maybe the question is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so effectively, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable and just focusing on \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). But then, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is not a single number.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again. Maybe the problem is expecting me to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but since the other part is in terms of \\(c\\), which is a separate variable, the coefficient would actually be the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. But that seems odd because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, not a polynomial.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, so that we're left with a term that is just a constant times \\(a^2b^2\\). That is, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in that case, I would need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, and then multiply that by 6.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, then we need the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power, i.e., the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by 6 to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, how do I find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Again, using the binomial theorem. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) has a coefficient of 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. When you multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we need to consider the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion that are multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only multiplied by the constant term (to keep the exponent of \\(c\\) zero), the coefficient would indeed be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), we would have to find the corresponding term. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms, I think the correct approach is to find the constant term in the second expansion and multiply it by the coefficient from the first part.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. Let me verify \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) again. 4 choose 2 is indeed 6, since \\(4! / (2!2!) = 24 / 4 = 6\\). And 6 choose 3 is 20, as \\(6! / (3!3!) = 720 / (6 \\times 6) = 720 / 36 = 20\\). So, those calculations are correct.\n\nTherefore, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   Here, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   We need the constant term (the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) in the expansion. The general term in the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   Setting the exponent of \\(c\\) to zero, we solve \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). The constant term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from both parts:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " I think I should break it down into parts because it's a product of two binomial expressions. So, maybe I can find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in each part separately and then multiply them together? Wait, no, that might not be the right approach because the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps the \\(c\\) terms don't affect it. That is, maybe the coefficient is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) part, and the other part doesn't contribute because it's multiplied by other variables. So, perhaps I can ignore the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product, so each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. Wait, but if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then I need to consider only the terms in the product where the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts are \\(a^2b^2\\) and the \\(c\\) parts can be anything. But actually, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, so the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, if I'm looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), then in the first part, the coefficient is some number, and in the second part, it's \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded has various terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But when I multiply them together, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, is that correct? Because if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then any term in the product would be something like \\(a^k b^{4 - k}\\) times \\(c^m\\) or \\(c^{-m}\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would be the term where \\(k = 2\\) and \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) is the binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. Now, since the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when I expand it, each term is of the form \\(\\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the entire expansion of the second part is a sum of terms with various powers of \\(c\\). Now, when I multiply the two expansions together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because for each term in the first part, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the second part, regardless of the \\(c\\) power. But wait, no, that's not right. Because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but it doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But wait, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me check again. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, which has various powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is just 6, and the rest is multiplied by other terms. But that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would include all the terms from the second expansion. Wait, no, when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. So, the coefficient would be 6 * \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a single number. Hmm, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so it's a coefficient in a multi-variable polynomial. But in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is usually a number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all possible terms, regardless of \\(c\\). That is, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6, but that seems unlikely because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient would include the contributions from the second part.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it differently. Let me consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, if I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), etc. Similarly, expanding \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives terms with various powers of \\(c\\). When I multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are \\(\\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part, which is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\), multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, no, because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. That seems correct. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would indeed be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is just 6, and the rest is part of other terms. But that can't be right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in one is multiplied by each term in the other, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression when considering all variables, but that would still be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Hmm, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a constant factor. Wait, no, because the second part is a binomial expression, so it's not a constant. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all possible terms, regardless of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, I would need to find the term in the second expansion where \\(c^0\\) occurs, which is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient for that term is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem didn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is a separate factor, so the overall coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a number. Therefore, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 64, giving 384. So, the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), where the sum of all coefficients is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives the coefficient as \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " I think I should break it down into parts because the expression has two separate binomial expansions. Maybe I can handle each part separately and then combine them somehow.\n\nFirst, let's consider the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). I remember that when expanding a binomial like \\((x + y)^n\\), the coefficients can be found using the binomial theorem, which states that each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{n}{k}x^{n - k}y^k\\). So, in this case, \\(x\\) is \\(a\\), \\(y\\) is \\(b\\), and \\(n\\) is 4.\n\nI need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let me set up the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. That would mean \\(n - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\) and \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\), since the exponents add up to 4. So, \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. That means the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\).\n\nNow, the expression also has the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but this second part involves \\(c\\). Wait, does that mean I need to consider the expansion of this part as well? Hmm, maybe not directly, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables from \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the product of the coefficients from each part, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, when we multiply the two expansions together, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we can treat the two parts independently. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because when you multiply two terms, one from each expansion, the variables from each part multiply together. So, to get a term that's only \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms must cancel out, meaning their exponents must add up to zero. Alternatively, since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are present, maybe we can have exponents that add up to zero.\n\nBut actually, I think the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms with various powers of \\(c\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we need the term in the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\), because \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0 = a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion, will give the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression.\n\nSo, let me calculate the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - k - k = 6 - 2k\\). We need this exponent to be zero, so:\n\n\\(6 - 2k = 0\\)\n\nSolving for \\(k\\):\n\n\\(2k = 6\\)\n\n\\(k = 3\\)\n\nSo, the term where \\(k = 3\\) will have \\(c^0\\). The coefficient for this term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, let me check that again. Wait, 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 6! / (3!3!) = 720 / (6 * 6) = 720 / 36 = 20. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, the first part gives 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, and the second part gives 20c\u2070, which is just 20. So when you multiply them together, you get 6 * 20 * a\u00b2b\u00b2c\u2070, which is 120a\u00b2b\u00b2. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about it as the entire product being the product of the two expansions, so each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only looking for the term where the variables are a\u00b2b\u00b2, regardless of the c terms, but actually, no, because if you take a term from the first expansion with a\u00b2b\u00b2 and multiply it by a term from the second expansion with c^k, you'd get a\u00b2b\u00b2c^k, which isn't the same as a\u00b2b\u00b2. So, to get a term that's exactly a\u00b2b\u00b2, you need to multiply a\u00b2b\u00b2 from the first expansion by c^0 from the second expansion, which is just 1. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but hold on, is that the only way? Because if you have a\u00b2b\u00b2 in the first part, and you multiply it by any term from the second part, it would be a\u00b2b\u00b2 times something with c's. So, the only way to get a term that's just a\u00b2b\u00b2 is to multiply a\u00b2b\u00b2 by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20. So, that makes sense.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, for the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of a\u00b2b\u00b2 is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) which is 6, correct. For the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with c^0 is when 6 - 2k = 0, so k=3, and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) which is 20, correct. So, 6 * 20 is indeed 120.\n\nTherefore, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break it down into two parts and handle each separately.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when the exponent from \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\) cancel each other out. This happens when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), solving for \\(k\\) gives \\(k = 3\\). The binomial coefficient for this term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " I think I should break it down into parts. Maybe I can handle each part separately and then combine the results.\n\nFirst, I know that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, in this case, for \\((a + b)^4\\), I can expand it and find the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nLet me write that out. The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) would be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\n\\]\n\nSo, looking for the term with \\(a^2b^2\\), that's the third term where \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient there would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder if I need to expand this as well. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), not \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\n\nWait, but if I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial.\n\nWait, but actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product. So, perhaps I need to consider how the terms combine. Let me think: when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the other factors must multiply to a constant term, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6, which is the coefficient from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part.\n\nOkay, so now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well.\n\nThe expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, I need to solve for \\(k\\) in the equation:\n\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(k\\):\n\n\\[\n6 = 2k \\implies k = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\). Let me compute that term:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{6 - 2(3)} = \\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = \\dbinom{6}{3} \\times 1 = \\dbinom{6}{3}\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\n\\]\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, 6! is 720, but 3! is 6, so 3!3! is 6\u00d76=36, so 720 \u00f7 36 is indeed 20. So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes here. Let me go through it again.\n\nFirst, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. That seems correct.\n\nNext, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I'm looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Setting 6 - 2k = 0 gives k = 3, which is correct. Then, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20, so that term is 20.\n\nTherefore, when I multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by 20, giving a coefficient of 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the problem was just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient is the product of the coefficients from each part, as the \\(c\\) terms are separate. So, yes, that makes sense.\n\nWait, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply for each term. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial and the constant term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just check if I made any calculation errors. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, correct. \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20, correct. So, 6 \u00d7 20 is 120. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I'm not missing anything else. Is there any other term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that could contribute to the constant term? No, because when k=3, that's the only term where the exponent is zero. So, that's the only term that contributes to the constant. So, I think I'm correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts: expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) and finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2 b^2 = 6 a^2 b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The constant term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " I'm a bit confused because the expression has two parts multiplied together: one involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I can focus on the first part first and then see how the second part affects it. \n\nFirst, I know that when expanding a binomial like \\((a + b)^n\\), each term is given by the binomial theorem: \\(\\binom{n}{k}a^{n - k}b^k\\) for \\(k\\) from 0 to \\(n\\). So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion will have terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\). Specifically, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) would be when \\(k = 2\\), right? So, the coefficient there would be \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm not sure if this affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because it's a different variable. Wait, but the entire expression is the product of these two expansions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to consider the other part? Or do I?\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term will be multiplied by all the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of a larger product, so the coefficient would actually be the sum of the products of the coefficients from each part. Hmm, but wait, that would be if we were looking for a term that includes both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, does that mean I should consider the entire expression and sum over all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms?\n\nWait, but that seems complicated. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Since this is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is another expansion, the entire expression is the product of these two. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps we need to consider all the possible ways that \\(a^2b^2\\) can be formed, but in this case, it's only from the first part, and the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, maybe the coefficient remains 6?\n\nWait, no, that doesn't sound right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would actually be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the coefficients from the second part are associated with different variables. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem correct because the variables are different.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the expansion, but since the other part is in terms of \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But that doesn't seem right because the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\), so when you multiply, you're getting terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too high. Wait, but is that correct?\n\nWait, let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all the terms of the other polynomial. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6 is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) would be 6 * 1, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) would be 6 * 6, and so on. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, does that mean we need to sum all the coefficients from the second expansion because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), effectively making the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product equal to 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second polynomial?\n\nWait, but if that's the case, then yes, the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach because \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the first polynomial, and the second polynomial is separate. So, when you multiply them, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, but the variables are different, so the coefficients for the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms remain the same, and the \\(c\\) terms are separate. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's the case. Let me think differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we can treat the two parts separately. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's in terms of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient remains 6. But that seems contradictory to what I thought earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, so when you expand it, each term will be a product of terms from each polynomial. So, for example, a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term from the second polynomial, which are terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, let me check this with a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion would be \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be 1 * (1 + 1) = 2, because \\(a^2\\) is multiplied by both \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), each with coefficient 1. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product is 1 * (1 + 1) = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2 * (1 + 1) = 4, and the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) would be 1 * (1 + 1) = 2. So, in this case, each coefficient from the first polynomial is multiplied by the sum of coefficients from the second polynomial.\n\nApplying this to the original problem, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, each coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) would be multiplied by 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this. Let's compute the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of coefficients, we set \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of the two expansions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion with coefficient 6, and it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all the terms of the other polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's 6 times the entire second polynomial, meaning 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think the answer is 384.\n\nBut let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let's consider the structure of the product:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\nand\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15\\dfrac{1}{c^2} + 6\\dfrac{1}{c^4} + \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\n\\]\n\nWhen we multiply these together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first will be multiplied by each term in the second, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial because each term in the second polynomial is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). The sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, as calculated earlier, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when we talk about the coefficient of a term in a product of polynomials, if the term is present in only one of the polynomials, then its coefficient in the product is its original coefficient multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the other polynomial. So, in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first polynomial, its coefficient in the product is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when variables are involved, you might have to consider cross terms, but in this case, the variables are separate, so the coefficients multiply directly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach it differently. Let's consider that the entire expression is the product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Since the second expansion's sum of coefficients is 64, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Find the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives 64.\n3. Multiply these two results: 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) includes the term \\(\\binom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\), where \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\n2. **Find the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. Substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the two results:**\n   Since each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part (6) multiplied by the sum of coefficients from the second part (64). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " First, I think I should expand both parts separately and then see how they combine.\n\nStarting with the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). I remember that when you expand a binomial like this, you can use the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^k\\). So, applying that here, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\), right?\n\nSince I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, let's set up the equation: \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), which means \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). So, the coefficient here is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. Each term will be \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, it becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWait, but in the original problem, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, but the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables. So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the product of the coefficients from each part? Or do I need to consider something else?\n\nWait, no, I think I might be overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), must contribute a term that is a constant, i.e., a term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the only way it won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.\n\nSo, in other words, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, I need to multiply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) from the second part. Because when you multiply the two parts together, the \\(c^0\\) term from the second part won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.\n\nSo, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's work on that.\n\nFrom the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\), which is just \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\): \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, I need to multiply the coefficients from both parts. That is, 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6, and in the second part, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. When I multiply these two, I get 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider if there are any other terms that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). But since the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), any term from that expansion will either have a positive or negative power of \\(c\\), except for the constant term. So, only the constant term from the second part will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part without introducing any \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, 120 should be the correct coefficient.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: when you expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will multiply each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will multiply every term from the second part. But since we're interested only in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can ignore the terms from the second expansion that have any power of \\(c\\) because they won't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, only the constant term from the second expansion matters, which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. This occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\) gives \\(m = 3\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, we multiply the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Maybe I should start by understanding what the problem is asking. It's asking for the coefficient of a specific term in a product of two expansions. So, I think I can handle this by expanding each part separately and then seeing how they combine.\n\nFirst, I'll consider the \\((a + b)^4\\) part. I remember that when you expand a binomial like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can use the binomial theorem, which states that each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^k\\). So, in this case, \\(n = 4\\), so the expansion will have terms from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(k = 4\\).\n\nI need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the binomial expansion, that would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) because \\(a^{4 - 2}b^2 = a^2b^2\\). The coefficient here is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to expand this as well, but wait, how does this relate to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term? Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), I think the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the product of the coefficients from each expansion? Wait, no, that doesn't seem right because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, and the second part contributes a constant factor? Hmm, that might be the case.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part evaluated at the terms that don't involve \\(c\\). Wait, no, that might not be correct because the second part doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would mean that the coefficient is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that can't be right either because each term in the second expansion is a power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\). So, that implies that the only term in the second expansion that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, I think I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient from the first part.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the term in the second expansion that is \\(c^0\\), you get \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1 = a^2b^2\\), which is the term we're interested in. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part.\n\nSo, let me compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, each term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that can't be right because 6! is 720, but 3! is 6, so 6!/(3!3!) = 720/(6\u00d76) = 720/36 = 20. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20.\n\nNow, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is 6, as I found earlier. So, the total coefficient in the entire expression is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. So, the first part gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives 20 for \\(c^0\\), so when you multiply these together, you get 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's only the term where the second factor contributes a \\(c^0\\) that will result in an \\(a^2b^2\\) term. All other terms would have some power of \\(c\\) attached, making them \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or similar, which aren't \\(a^2b^2\\) alone. So, yes, only the \\(c^0\\) term contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think about the expansions again.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\) expansion:\n\n- The term \\(a^4\\) has coefficient 1,\n- \\(a^3b\\) has coefficient 4,\n- \\(a^2b^2\\) has coefficient 6,\n- \\(ab^3\\) has coefficient 4,\n- \\(b^4\\) has coefficient 1.\n\nSo, that's correct, \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion:\n\nWe can write each term as \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\).\n\nSo, yes, that term is 20.\n\nTherefore, when we multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by 20, giving \\(20a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 20 \u00d7 6 = 120.\n\nWait, no, actually, no, I think I made a mistake here. Wait, the first part's coefficient is 6, and the second part's coefficient is 20, so when you multiply them together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. But wait, no, that's not correct because the second part is being multiplied as a whole, so actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me think differently. Suppose I consider the entire expression as the product of two polynomials. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum over all possible ways to get \\(a^2b^2\\) by multiplying terms from each polynomial. But since the second polynomial doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiply it by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me write out the expansions more formally.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\).\n\nSecond, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply these two together, the product is:\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\right) \\times \\left(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\right)\n\\]\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to look at all terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively. That is, we need \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial, which occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\).\n\nNow, this term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. However, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to consider only the terms in the second polynomial that have \\(c^0\\), because multiplying by \\(c^0\\) will leave \\(a^2b^2\\) unchanged, while any other power of \\(c\\) would result in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), which aren't \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nTherefore, the only term in the second polynomial that contributes is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient for this term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not confusing anything here. So, the first polynomial contributes 6 to \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second polynomial contributes 20 to \\(c^0\\). When you multiply them, you get 6 \u00d7 20 = 120 for the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, that's correct.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\) in the expansion:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.

I remember that the binomial theorem states that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, in this case, \\(n = 4\\). The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(n - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe are looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, let me check that again because 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720 divided by (6 \u00d7 6) is 720/36, which is indeed 20. So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to multiply the coefficient from the first expansion by the constant term from the second expansion. So, that's 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (the constant term). 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there any other term that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplying the two expansions? Hmm, no, because the first expansion only has terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), while the second expansion only has terms in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the only way to get a term with only \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term from the second expansion. There's no other term in the second expansion that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so I think that's the only contribution. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nJust to recap, the steps were:\n1. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem, which gave me 6.\n2. Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem, which gave me 20.\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together to get the final coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and the logic makes sense because the two variables are separate, so their expansions don't interfere with each other beyond the constant term.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts: finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\n1. **Finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n\n   Using the binomial theorem, we know that:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n\n   Using the binomial theorem, we know that:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which happens when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\).

    "text": " Maybe I should break it down into parts. \n\nFirst, I think I can consider each part of the product separately and then see how they combine. So, the expression is a product of two binomials raised to powers: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since these are multiplied together, the terms from each expansion will multiply each other. But I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the second part. So, does that mean that the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\)? \n\nI think so. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but wait, no. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, actually, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), maybe the \\(c\\) terms don't affect it. Hmm, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which has different powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it would become \\(a^2b^2\\) times something involving \\(c\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for different values of \\(k\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply that \\(c\\) terms are not considered. Wait, that doesn't seem right because the entire expression includes both \\(a, b, c\\), so maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that might not make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when multiplied by the second expansion, it would create terms that have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for different \\(k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and then considering that this is multiplied by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, regardless of the \\(c\\) part, perhaps the coefficient is just the coefficient from the first part, and the second part's expansion is irrelevant? But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering all possible terms where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\) times some \\(c\\) terms, but the coefficient would then be a sum over all the coefficients from the second expansion. Hmm, but that seems a bit more involved.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach it differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, if I expand each part separately, then the product will consist of all possible products of terms from each expansion. So, for the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the general term is \\(\\binom{4}{k}a^{k}b^{4 - k}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4. Similarly, for the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\binom{6}{m}c^{m} \\times (1/c)^{6 - m}\\) which simplifies to \\(\\binom{6}{m}c^{2m - 6}\\), where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6.\n\nNow, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion comes from when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\). Then, this term is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\binom{6}{m}c^{2m - 6}\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times each \\(c^{2m - 6}\\) term would be \\(\\binom{4}{2} \\times \\binom{6}{m}\\). But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, but in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a sum, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product comes only from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part multiplied by the entire second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all variables, but that seems impossible because \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the first factor, and the second factor is in terms of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the answer is simply the coefficient from the first part, \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\), which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by terms that don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). But that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is indeed 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't seem right because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again: it says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, maybe the problem is considering all terms in the product, and the \\(a^2b^2\\) term can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and then the second part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by terms that don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). But that seems odd because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by all the terms in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be \\(\\binom{4}{2} \\times \\binom{6}{m}\\), where \\(k = 2m - 6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms, which would require that \\(k = 0\\), so \\(2m - 6 = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is \\(\\binom{4}{2} \\times \\binom{6}{3}\\).\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term in \\(c\\). So, I need to find the term in the second expansion where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(2m - 6 = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient from the second part is \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\), and from the first part, it's \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\). Multiplying these together gives the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term we're interested in.\n\nLet me calculate that. \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\) is 6, and \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\) is 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\). In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(c\\) cancels out (i.e., exponent zero) is when \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the product is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, let me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe I can consider the entire product and see if there's a way to find the coefficient directly. But I think the method I used is solid. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which happens at \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiplying these coefficients gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\).

Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. But wait, that's just for the \\((a + b)^4\\) part.

Because when you multiply two polynomials, the exponents add up. But in this case, I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only comes from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, their exponents won't affect the exponents of \\(c\\).

But that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). So perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Is the problem asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\)? That is, in the entire product, how many times does \\(a^2b^2\\) appear multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), and we just want the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the \\(c\\) terms. Or maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some specific power of \\(c\\), but the problem doesn't specify. Hmm, that's confusing.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It just says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without mentioning \\(c\\). So perhaps, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any combination of \\(c\\) terms, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so that can't be right.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I expand both parts separately, then each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we just take the coefficient from the first part and ignore the second part, but that seems unlikely because the entire expression is a product of both parts.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning that we're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That is, the term where \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) multiply to give \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, perhaps we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product.\n\nIf that's the case, then we need to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, then multiply them together.\n\nLet me check that approach. So, first, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I calculated before.\n\nNow, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. To find that, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, it becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but the problem just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying \\(c\\). So, if we're considering the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would actually be a sum over all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a single coefficient. So, perhaps the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting us to consider that the entire expression is a product, and so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be combined with any term from the second expansion, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's considering the entire product, so the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the correct approach is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), so that the coefficient is a number, not a polynomial.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 6 (from the first part) times 20 (from the second part), giving 120.\n\nWait, but to confirm, let me think about the entire expansion. When you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the second part, but that seems unlikely because the entire expression is a product. Alternatively, maybe the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and we're supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) all in the same term, but that's not the case here. So, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the entire second expansion is multiplied by that, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 would be 384. But that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.\n\nWait, but that approach would be if we were looking for the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which might just be 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. But that doesn't seem right because the entire product is a combination of terms involving both \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is expecting us to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any combination of \\(c\\) terms, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be the same as in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense as a numerical coefficient.\n\nI'm getting a bit confused here. Let me try another approach. Let's consider the entire product as a product of two polynomials. The first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various exponents \\(k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be a sum of coefficients from the second polynomial, each multiplied by 6. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying \\(c\\), perhaps it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial. But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all independent, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is simply 6, and the \\(c\\) terms are separate. But that seems inconsistent because the entire expression is a product of both parts.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about it differently. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems like an approach where I'm considering the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which might not be the intended interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's just 6, but that seems too simple, and perhaps the problem is expecting more.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to have the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) all in the same term, but that's not the case here. So, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and that's it, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that seems inconsistent because the entire expression includes both \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\).\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible combinations of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial. But that can't be, because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nI'm getting stuck here. Let me try to approach it differently. Let me think about the entire expression as a product of two separate expansions. The first part is \\((a + b)^4\\), which has terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When you multiply these two, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which are of the form \\(c^k\\). Therefore, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each power of \\(c\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the sum of all coefficients from the second part multiplied by 6. But that would make the coefficient a sum, which is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, the sum of coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) all in the same term, but that's not the case here. So, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120, as I calculated earlier.\n\nWait, let me think again. If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, without considering \\(c\\), then it's just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. But that seems too simplistic, and I think the problem is expecting a more detailed approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which are of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps it's expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 times 20, giving 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. Therefore, the answer is 120.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm this approach. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, we need to consider all the terms from the second part multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's just 6 times the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, I think the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " I think I'll need to use the binomial theorem because both expressions are binomials raised to a power. \n\nFirst, maybe I should handle each part separately. The expression is a product of two binomials, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will come from multiplying the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficients of the corresponding terms in the second part. Wait, but the second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables from \\(c\\), maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. That is, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) should just come from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), right? Because when we multiply by the second part, which is in terms of \\(c\\), those terms won't interact with \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So maybe I can treat them separately.\n\nSo, first, let's focus on \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^n\\) is the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(n\\) of \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^k\\). In this case, \\(n = 4\\). So, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) would be when \\(k = 2\\), because then \\(a^{4 - 2} = a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\). So the coefficient here would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, since the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, when we multiply the two expressions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But wait, that means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that right?\n\nWait, no. Because when we multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But actually, the sum of the coefficients in a binomial expansion can be found by setting the variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, is that correct? Because actually, when you multiply the two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, but the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only multiplied by the constant term (if any) in the second expression, right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so to get a term without \\(c\\), we need to multiply it by the constant term in the second expression. Wait, but in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), is there a constant term?\n\nLet me check that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will have terms of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). We need the exponent to be zero for a constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, so earlier I thought that the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients, which is 6*64=384, but that's not correct because only the constant term in the second expression will contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term when multiplied. So, the correct approach is to find the constant term in the second expression and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression.\n\nSo, let me recast this. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), has \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), has a constant term when expanded, which is 20. So, when we multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that makes sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second, and only when the variables don't interact, which in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only affected by the constant term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make a mistake, let me double-check the constant term in the second expression. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\cdot (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). To find the constant term, set the exponent equal to zero: 6 - 2k = 0 \u21d2 k = 3. So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). So, yes, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you have the product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial, provided that the variables don't interact. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term can only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial and the constant term in the second polynomial. So, that's another way to see that it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to expand both expressions fully and then multiply them, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would only come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion by the constant term in the second expansion, because any other term in the second expansion would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) component, which would make the product have variables \\(a^2b^2c^n\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^n\\), which aren't \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the constant term in the second expansion contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product.\n\nSo, to sum up, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying them together gives 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. I don't see any mistakes in this reasoning. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is given by:\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{2} a^2b^2\n\\]\nCalculating the binomial coefficient:\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). We need the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) because it will not affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term when multiplied. The general term in the expansion is:\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\frac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nTo find the constant term, set the exponent equal to zero:\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\nThe constant term is:\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nFinally, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So maybe I can find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) separately and then just consider the other part as a constant or something. \n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can just find that coefficient in the first part and then, since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it will just be a constant multiplier. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that might not be right. Because when you multiply, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second, but since I'm only looking for terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\), the other part, the \\(c\\) terms, will just be coefficients multiplied along with them. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right either because each term in the second expression is multiplied by each term in the first. But since I'm only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, the \\(c\\) parts can be anything because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts. So, maybe the coefficient is just the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second part evaluated at any value? Hmm, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about it differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So when you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\binom{4}{k}a^{k}b^{4 - k}\\) multiplied by \\(\\binom{6}{m}c^{m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{6 - m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\binom{4}{k}\\binom{6}{m}a^{k}b^{4 - k}c^{m - (6 - m)}\\) which simplifies to \\(\\binom{4}{k}\\binom{6}{m}a^{k}b^{4 - k}c^{2m - 6}\\). \n\nBut I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let's see, for \\(a^2b^2\\), we need \\(k = 2\\) and \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\). Now, the second part can be any term, but since I'm only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, the \\(c\\) parts will just be multiplied along, but since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient will be the sum over all possible \\(m\\) of \\(\\binom{6}{m}\\) multiplied by \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because each term is a product of the two binomial coefficients. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to \\(\\binom{4}{2} \\times 64\\)? \n\nWait, let me check that. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), which is the sum of all coefficients. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by 64, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) becomes \\(\\binom{4}{2} \\times 64\\). So, \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\), so 6 times 64 is 384. So, the coefficient is 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Is it correct to consider the entire sum of coefficients in the second part? Because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. So, that would mean the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2} \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product. Wait, no, actually, the product is a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, each term in the product is of the form \\(a^k b^{4 - k} c^{2m - 6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\binom{4}{2} \\times \\binom{6}{m}\\). So, that would be \\(\\binom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m}\\). But \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\), so the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I can consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is only dependent on the first part, and the second part just scales it. So, since the second part evaluates to 64 when \\(c = 1\\), which is the sum of all its coefficients, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(\\binom{4}{2} \\times 64 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as two separate expansions. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\), and since the second part \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is being multiplied, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure that this is correct. Let me try a smaller example to check. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we have \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be... but wait, in this case, the highest power of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is 2 each, so \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present. Hmm, maybe that's not a good example. Let me try another one. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it's \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) would be \\(c + 1/c\\), and the coefficient of \\(b\\) would also be \\(c + 1/c\\). So, if I were to look for the coefficient of \\(a\\), it's \\(c + 1/c\\), which is 2 when \\(c = 1\\). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 2. \n\nWait, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(1 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), so when \\(c = 1\\), it's 2, which matches. So, maybe in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\binom{4}{2} \\times 2^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me think differently. Maybe I should consider the entire expansion and see how the terms combine. Each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\binom{4}{k}a^k b^{4 - k}\\) and each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\binom{6}{m}c^m (1/c)^{6 - m} = \\binom{6}{m}c^{2m - 6}\\). So, when you multiply these, each term is \\(\\binom{4}{k}\\binom{6}{m}a^k b^{4 - k}c^{2m - 6}\\). \n\nNow, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\) and \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\binom{6}{m}\\). So, that's \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\sum_{m=0}^{6}\\binom{6}{m}\\). But \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6}\\binom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\), so the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient in the first part times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. Since the sum of the coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\binom{4}{2} \\times 64 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nI think that's correct. Let me just double-check. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Then, when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has 64 as the sum of its coefficients, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that seems right. \n\nSo, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\). The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " Maybe I should start by understanding each part of the expression separately and then see how they come together.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression raised to a power like \\((a + b)^4\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^k\\). So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion will have terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\), each multiplied by a binomial coefficient.\n\nI'm specifically looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) because \\(n - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). The binomial coefficient here is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder if this part also needs to be expanded. But wait, I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term doesn't involve \\(c\\), so maybe the part with \\(c\\) doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, let me think about that.\n\nActually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider how the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) might influence it. But wait, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't have any \\(c\\) in it, so when I multiply by any term from the second expression, it will introduce some power of \\(c\\). But since I'm only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find the terms in the second expression that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), result in a term without \\(c\\). Because if I'm just looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), then any \\(c\\) terms would make it a different term, right?\n\nWait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Or is it? Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, I think it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) part because \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expression evaluated at some point? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second expression is also raised to a power and multiplied.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to think differently. When I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of the first will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, and the second part can contribute any term, but since we're just looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient will be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire sum of the coefficients from the second part? Hmm, that might not be correct.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and I multiply it by every term in the second part, each of those products will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\). So, how can that happen? Unless the second expression has a term that is a constant, i.e., \\(c^0\\), which is 1. Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by 1, I get \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term we're interested in.\n\nSo, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is the constant term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, first, let me find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expression is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, that would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). Let me calculate that: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Is there any other term in the second expression that could contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term when multiplied by something else? For example, if I have a term with \\(c^1\\) and multiply it by a term with \\(c^{-1}\\), that would give me a constant term. But in our case, we're only considering the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, which doesn't have any \\(c\\) in it. So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term from the second expression. So, I think my reasoning is correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\nWait a second, let me just check my steps again to be thorough. First, I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, I found the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Then, I multiplied them together to get 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as the product of two independent expansions. So, when you multiply them, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but only the term with \\(c^0\\) will result in a term that is \\(a^2b^2\\) times 1, which is \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms from the second expansion will have some power of \\(c\\), making the resulting term have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, only the constant term from the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the final product.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in this part is 20.\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both parts:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Using the binomial theorem, each term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). So, for \\(a^2b^2\\), I think I need the term where \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me check that: if \\(k = 2\\), then the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2} b^{2}\\). What's \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\)? That's 6, right? Because 4 choose 2 is 6. So the coefficient from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part is 6.\n\nNow, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So maybe the other part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Or does it? Hmm, no, actually, the entire expression is a product of two expansions. So when we multiply them, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion.\n\nBut wait, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what happens with \\(c\\). So maybe I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms when looking for \\(a^2b^2\\). That is, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by the entire second expansion, which includes various powers of \\(c\\), but since the question isn't asking about \\(c\\), maybe I just need to consider the coefficient from the first part and then, since the second part is being multiplied, it's like the coefficient is multiplied by the entire second expansion. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second expansion isn't a single term.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I just need to find how many times \\(a^2b^2\\) appears in the entire product. So that would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But wait, no, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which isn't right because each term in the product is a combination of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, and the coefficients multiply as well. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the first expansion, then when I multiply by the second expansion, each term in the second expansion will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product will only come from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion multiplied by any term in the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, does that mean I just need to take the coefficient from the first part and multiply it by the entire second expansion? Or perhaps I need to consider that the second expansion's terms don't affect the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just 6 times the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, I need to find the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, and then multiply that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the other polynomial when considering the product.\n\nWait, let me think about that. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). Then, the product P(a, b) * Q(c) will have terms that are products of terms from P and terms from Q. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of a specific term in P, say \\(a^2b^2\\), then in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q, because each term in Q is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in this case, the coefficient would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, for the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of the coefficients would be when we set \\(c = 1\\), because that makes each term's coefficient add up. So, let's compute that.\n\nWhen \\(c = 1\\), \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, so the total coefficient is 6*64=384. That seems right. Alternatively, I could think of it as the coefficient being 6 multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but is that correct? Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by each term in the other polynomial. So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, so the coefficient would actually be 6 times each coefficient in the second polynomial, but that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a single coefficient, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me clarify: the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every possible term from the second expansion, each of which is a power of \\(c\\). So, the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because \\(a^2b^2\\) is only one term in the product, but when you multiply by the second expansion, each term in the second expansion will produce a new term with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, in reality, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is not just 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion because each term in the second expansion adds a different power of \\(c\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) part.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion contributes its own coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, as I calculated before, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, and the coefficient from the first expansion is 6, so 6*64=384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with an example. Suppose I have a simpler case: \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding it, we get \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c. Now, the coefficient of \\(a b\\) would be zero because there are no \\(a b\\) terms. Wait, but in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is (1 from (a + b)) times (sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 2). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be 1*2=2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would be 1*2=2. But in reality, when you expand, you get terms like \\(a c\\), \\(a/c\\), \\(b c\\), \\(b/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2 (from \\(a c + a/c\\)), and similarly for \\(b\\). So, this seems to check out.\n\nAnother example: Let's take \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). Expanding \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). The sum of coefficients in the second expansion is \\((1 + 1)^2 = 4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product would be 1*4=4, coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2*4=8, and coefficient of \\(b^2\\) would be 1*4=4. Now, let's expand the product:\n\n\\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2)\\) because \\((c + 1/c)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\).\n\nMultiplying out, we get:\n\n\\(a^2c^2 + 2a^2 + a^2/c^2 + 2ab c^2 + 4ab + 2ab/c^2 + b^2c^2 + 2b^2 + b^2/c^2\\).\n\nNow, looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2\\), it's 2 from \\(2a^2\\). But according to our earlier method, it should be 1*4=4. Wait, that's a discrepancy. Hmm, so maybe my earlier reasoning was wrong.\n\nWait, in this example, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product is 2, but according to the method, it should be 1*4=4. So, that suggests that my initial approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, so maybe I need to think differently. Let me see. The problem arises because in the product, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, but that's not correct because \\(a^2\\) is being multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But when we look for the coefficient of \\(a^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's actually the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the first polynomial. Wait, but in the example, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the first polynomial is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second is 4, so 1*4=4, but when I expanded, I only saw 2 as the coefficient of \\(a^2\\). So, clearly, something's wrong with my reasoning.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me check the expansion again. When I expanded \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), I got terms like \\(a^2c^2\\), \\(2a^2\\), \\(a^2/c^2\\), etc. So, the term \\(2a^2\\) comes from \\(a^2 \\times 2\\), where 2 is the middle term in the expansion of \\((c + 1/c)^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product is 2, not 4. So, that suggests that my initial approach was wrong.\n\nWait, so perhaps the correct way is to realize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in each part. But wait, in the first part, it's 6, and in the second part, there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term because the second part only has \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the entire second expansion, but that can't be because the coefficient should be a number.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to approach this differently. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\). So, in the product, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first expansion, specifically the term \\(6a^2b^2\\), and this term is then multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which are of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to 6.\n\nTherefore, when we multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, we get \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2k}\\) is \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), but in the product, it's multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is the sum of all the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2 c^{n}\\) for all \\(n\\), which would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, but in my earlier example, that approach didn't work because when I set \\(c = 1\\), I got a different result. So, perhaps I need to clarify: when the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's considering the entire product, which includes terms with different powers of \\(c\\). But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself doesn't involve \\(c\\), so in the product, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part multiplied by \\(c^0\\) from the second part. Because \\(c^0 = 1\\), so that would mean the term where the second part contributes \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. Because when you multiply, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term from the second expansion.\n\nSo, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nNow, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that seems different from my earlier conclusion of 384. So, which one is correct? Let me check with the example I had earlier.\n\nIn the example: \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is \\(\\dbinom{2}{2} = 1\\). The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is \\(\\dbinom{2}{1} = 2\\), since \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) when \\(k = 1\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Let's check the expansion:\n\n\\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\).\n\n\\((c + 1/c)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\).\n\nMultiplying them gives:\n\n\\(a^2c^2 + 2a^2 + a^2/c^2 + 2ab c^2 + 4ab + 2ab/c^2 + b^2c^2 + 2b^2 + b^2/c^2\\).\n\nLooking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but wait, there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term in this product. The terms are \\(a^2c^2\\), \\(2a^2\\), \\(a^2/c^2\\), \\(2ab c^2\\), \\(4ab\\), \\(2ab/c^2\\), \\(b^2c^2\\), \\(2b^2\\), \\(b^2/c^2\\). So, the only terms with \\(a^2\\) are those with \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), and \\(1/c^2\\). Similarly, the terms with \\(b^2\\) are similar. But there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term because to get \\(a^2b^2\\), you would need to multiply \\(a^2\\) from the first part by \\(b^2\\) from the second part, but the second part only has \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^2\\), which doesn't have \\(b\\) terms. So, actually, in this example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because there's no way to get both \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) in the product since the second expansion only involves \\(c\\).\n\nWait, that's a problem. So, in the original problem, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\), which has \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, when you multiply them, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by the constant term from the second part, which is \\(c^0\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but in my earlier example, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because there's no \\(b^2\\) in the second expansion. So, in the original problem, since the second expansion only involves \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and multiply it by the constant term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nSo, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but that was when I considered the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which would be when \\(c = 1\\). But in reality, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), so we need to find the term where the second expansion contributes a constant term, i.e., \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion.\n\nSo, in the original problem, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with another example to make sure I'm not making a mistake. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the first part is 1, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 2 (since \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\), so the constant term is 0, wait no, that's not right. Wait, \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\), so there is no constant term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 0. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be 1 * 0 = 0. But when we expand, we get \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). There is no term with \\(a\\) alone, only \\(a c\\) and \\(a/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is zero, which matches our calculation.\n\nAnother example: \\((a + b)^3 \\times (c + 1/c)^3\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^1\\) in the first part is \\(\\dbinom{3}{2} = 3\\). The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is \\(\\dbinom{3}{1} = 3\\) because \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) when \\(k = 3\\), but wait, no, in \\((c + 1/c)^3\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{3}{k}c^{3 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{3}{k}c^{3 - 2k}\\). Setting exponent to 0: \\(3 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 1.5\\), which is not an integer, so there is no constant term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is zero, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^1\\) in the product is 3 * 0 = 0.\n\nBut when we expand \\((a + b)^3 \\times (c + 1/c)^3\\), we get terms like \\(a^3c^3\\), \\(3a^3\\), \\(3a^3/c^3\\), etc., but no \\(a^2b\\) term because the second expansion doesn't have \\(b\\) terms. Wait, no, actually, the second expansion doesn't have \\(b\\) terms, so any term involving \\(b\\) can only come from the first expansion. So, in the product, the only way to get \\(a^2b\\) is to have \\(a^2b\\) from the first expansion multiplied by some term from the second expansion. But since the second expansion doesn't have \\(b\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b\\) in the product is zero, which matches our calculation.\n\nTherefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). Setting the exponent to 0 gives \\(k = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " First, I know that when expanding expressions like \\((a + b)^n\\), the coefficients can be found using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nI need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I'm looking for the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is also squared in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me write that out. The general term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). I want the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, substituting \\(k = 2\\), the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part is 6. Now, what about the other part of the expression, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? I guess since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is part of the first factor, and the second factor is multiplied by it, I need to consider how the multiplication works.\n\nWait, but hold on. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but the expression also involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, does that mean that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a separate term from the \\(c\\) expansion. Alternatively, perhaps the entire expression is a product, so each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, regardless of the second part. Hmm, that seems a bit confusing.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that the entire expression is a product of two expansions. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then when I multiply them out, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only be multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion, because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factors, which would make it a different term altogether.\n\nWait, so maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the question is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, no, that doesn't seem right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first expansion, and the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients from each part. But that can't be right because the second part is a sum of terms with \\(c\\), so unless the second part has a constant term, the product won't have a term without \\(c\\). Wait, but if I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then maybe I need to consider all the terms in the second expansion and multiply them by the coefficient from the first part, but that would give me a sum of coefficients, each multiplied by \\(c\\) terms, which doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is that I need to find the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) times any term from the second expansion, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first factor, and the second factor is multiplied by it, the overall term would be \\(a^2b^2\\) times something involving \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests that perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 1, but that doesn't make sense because the second factor is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which isn't 1.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Perhaps the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and then consider that it's multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps the answer is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6. But that seems too straightforward, and I'm probably missing something.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would involve terms from both expansions. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part, and \\(c\\) in the other, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear is when you take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by the constant term from the second part, because otherwise, you'd have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) in the term, which would make it \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something, which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6.\n\nSo, let me try that approach. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The constant term would be the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, let's use the binomial theorem on \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the constant term is 20. Now, since the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives me \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Then, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives me terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\), with the middle term at \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term, and that's 20. So, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first is multiplied by every term in the second, but only the constant term in the second will result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times a constant. All other terms would have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factors, making them \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or similar, which aren't just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the only contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20. So, multiplying 6 by 20 gives 120.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, does that mean I need to sum over all possible products where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion? But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering the entire product as a single expression and looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because the expression would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. But that seems different from what I thought before.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by any term from the second expansion, but since \\(c\\) is a separate variable, the coefficient would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a constant. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), meaning that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be the constant term. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that we're considering the entire product and looking for all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is phrased as asking for the coefficient, which is usually a constant. So, perhaps the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in the \\(c\\) expansion, which would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating, and the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve multiplying the coefficient from the first part by the entire second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a constant, not a polynomial. So, perhaps the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the constant term from the second part, which is 20, giving 120 as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product when considering only the constant term in \\(c\\).\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, the correct interpretation must be that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the constant term in \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Suppose I expand both expressions:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\n\\]\n\nSo, when I multiply these two expansions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in:\n\n\\[\n6a^2b^2c^6 + 6a^2b^2c^4 + 90a^2b^2c^2 + 120a^2b^2 + 90a^2b^2c^{-2} + 6a^2b^2c^{-4} + 6a^2b^2c^{-6}\n\\]\n\nSo, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present with a coefficient of 120, and it's multiplied by \\(c^0\\). All other terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\) have some power of \\(c\\), so if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then technically, the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. But that would be \\(6 \\times (1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1)\\), which is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that seems too high, and I don't think that's what the problem is asking.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a single number. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the constant term. That would make sense, and in that case, the coefficient is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is phrased as asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), which would mean that we're treating \\(c\\) as a variable and looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a bit strange. So, perhaps the intended answer is 120, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\).\n\nWait, let me think differently. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a constant. So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering \\(c\\), which would mean that we're looking for the coefficient as a polynomial in \\(c\\), so it would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems too involved, and the problem is likely expecting a numerical answer.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is phrased as finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), giving 384. But that seems high, and I'm not sure if that's correct.\n\nWait, no, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in that would be 6 times 64 = 384. But is that the correct interpretation of the problem? The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the product, without specifying any constraints on \\(c\\). So, if we consider the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be a polynomial in \\(c\\), specifically 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a more complex expression, not a single number.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is usually a constant, so perhaps it's intended to consider only the constant term in \\(c\\), i.e., the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be the sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms, giving 384.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), specifically 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 120. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut given the way the problem is phrased, I think the intended answer is 120, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem is: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems complicated, and the problem is probably expecting a numerical answer. So, perhaps the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would be a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is intended to be interpreted as finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, I think I've spent enough time thinking through this. I'll go with the approach that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 from the first part, and the constant term from the second part is 20, so multiplying them gives 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the general term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   We need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), which occurs when \\(k = 2\\).

    "text": " First, I think I should consider each part of the expression separately and then see how they combine.\n\nStarting with the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). I remember that when you expand a binomial like this, you can use the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^k\\). So, applying this to \\((a + b)^4\\), each term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\).\n\nI need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I should find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would happen when \\(4 - k = 2\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I think I can use the binomial theorem here as well. Each term in the expansion will be \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWait, but I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But in the second part, the variables are \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so they don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). That means the terms involving \\(c\\) won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, does that mean the coefficient from the second part is just 1? Because when you multiply by 1, it doesn't change the coefficient.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. No, actually, the second part is being multiplied by the first part. So, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is being multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to consider the terms in the second part that don't involve \\(c\\), i.e., the constant term.\n\nBecause if we have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and we multiply it by any term from the second part that has a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot 1/c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we only want the term in the second part that is a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) because that way, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, from earlier, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Setting the exponent equal to zero, we get \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of the constant term in the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that can't be right. Let me check: 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720/(6*6) is 720/36, which is indeed 20. So, the coefficient is 20.\n\nNow, putting it all together. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of the constant term in the second part is 20. Since these two terms are multiplied together, the overall coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, the first part contributes 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part contributes 20 for the constant term. Multiplying them gives 6*20=120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. Let me just go through it again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent is zero, which occurs at m=3, giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when you multiply 6a^2b^2 by 20, you get 120a^2b^2. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs at \\(m=3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Maybe I can break it down into smaller parts. \n\nFirst, I know that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\).

That seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so when I multiply, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with those involving \\(c\\). That means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we're looking for the part of the product where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) either. Because if it's multiplied by a term with \\(c\\), then the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something, which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, we only need the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because that's the only term that won't add any \\(c\\) factors. Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, let me confirm that. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then I need to consider all possible ways to get \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplying the two expansions. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if we take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and multiply it by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second expansion. Any other term from the second expansion would introduce a \\(c\\) term, which would make the product have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, I think that's correct.\n\nTherefore, I need to find two things:\n\n1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found to be 6.\n\n2. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nOnce I have both, I can multiply them together to get the final coefficient.\n\nSo, let's tackle the second part: the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem for this. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because that's the constant term. So, set the exponent equal to 0:\n\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(k\\):\n\n\\[\n6 = 2k \\implies k = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\n\\]\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Wait, 6! is 720, but 3! is 6, so 6! / (3! * 3!) is 720 / (6 * 6) = 720 / 36 = 20. Yes, that's correct. So, the constant term is 20.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Let me double-check the steps.\n\nFirst, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is indeed 6, as per the binomial coefficients. Then, for the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I correctly identified that we need the term where the exponent is 0, which happens when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is indeed 20. So, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it another way. Let me consider the entire expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from choosing 2 a's and 2 b's in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6 ways. Then, for each of those terms, we multiply by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the terms where the exponent of c is zero, which is 20, as we found. So, the total contribution is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems consistent.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the terms in each polynomial that multiply together to give that term. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve c, we need to take the term from the first polynomial that is \\(a^2b^2\\) and multiply it by the term from the second polynomial that is \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other term that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). For example, could there be a term in the second expansion that, when multiplied by a term in the first expansion, gives \\(a^2b^2\\)? But since the second expansion only has terms in c and 1/c, and the first expansion only has terms in a and b, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and multiply it by the constant term from the second expansion. Any other term from the second expansion would introduce a c term, which would make the product have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, only the constant term contributes.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which happens when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\).

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should consider each part of the expression separately. The expression is a product of two binomials raised to powers, so maybe I can expand each part and then multiply them together. But wait, actually, I don't need to expand the entire expressions because I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That might save me some time.\n\nStarting with the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). I remember that when you expand a binomial like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can use the binomial theorem, which states that the expansion is the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(n\\) of \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^k\\). So, in this case, \\(n = 4\\), so the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will have terms like \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\).\n\nI specifically need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me see, in the expansion, when \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\) equals \\(a^2b^2\\), that would mean \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). The binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm not directly interested in the terms involving \\(c\\) because I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, but actually, the entire expression is the product of the two parts. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion will be the product of a term from each part.\n\nBut since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will result in a term that still has \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but actually, the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, the result will still have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think I might be misunderstanding something here.\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is the product of the two binomials. But \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that only comes from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), right? Because the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when multiplied, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by any term from the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps I need to consider that the coefficient is just the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of all coefficients from the second part. But that doesn't seem right because the second part might have terms with different powers of \\(c\\).\n\nWait, maybe I'm supposed to treat the entire expression as a product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\). So, let me compute \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit too straightforward. Let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only once from the first part, and then when multiplied by each term in the second part, each term would contribute to a different term in the product. But since the problem just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps it's indeed 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another thought: maybe the problem is actually looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that we also consider the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero. So, in that case, we would need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would result in \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Let me check that.\n\nYes, that makes more sense. So, perhaps I misread the problem initially. It's possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that the entire term is \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) from the second part.\n\nSo, let's correct my approach. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, as I found earlier. Now, in the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the sum from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\cdot \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6*6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but now it's 120. Which one is correct? Let me clarify the problem again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\"\n\nHmm, the way it's phrased, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the entire expansion, how many times does \\(a^2b^2\\) appear, multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that for each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), we get a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), where \\(k\\) is some integer. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but that can't be right because each term in the product is a combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's essentially the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that would be the same as taking the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nAs I calculated earlier, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut then again, if the problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, then it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think the confusion comes from whether the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms or specifically when \\(c\\) is also at a certain power. Since the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's more likely that it's looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nBut wait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" The way it's written, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any mention of \\(c\\), so perhaps it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the term \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, so \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nI think I need to clarify this. Let me consider both interpretations.\n\nFirst interpretation: The problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the expansion, any term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) would contribute to this coefficient. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nSecond interpretation: The problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that the \\(c\\) terms must cancel out, resulting in \\(a^2b^2\\) alone. In this case, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nSince the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), I think the first interpretation is correct, and the answer is 384. However, to be thorough, let me check both possibilities.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial affects all terms in the other polynomial. So, if you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's the sum over all possible terms from the second polynomial multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, which is 20, giving 120.\n\nI think I need to go with the first interpretation because the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you have a product of two polynomials, say P(a,b) * Q(c), the coefficient of a specific term in P(a,b) is not affected by Q(c) because they are separate variables. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a,b) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q(c). Because each term in Q(c) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient is the sum of all coefficients in Q(c) times the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a,b).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit counterintuitive because when you multiply by Q(c), you're introducing terms with \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would include all the possible coefficients from Q(c) multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, it would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in Q(c).\n\nAlternatively, if you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's different. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but it's written as \\(a^2b^2\\). Maybe that's a typo or misinterpretation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{m}\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) can be any integer from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion.\n\nBut that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if we're only interested in the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think I need to clarify this. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\"\n\nSince the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any mention of \\(c\\), I think it's implying that \\(c\\) can be any power, so the coefficient would be the sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut I'm a bit unsure because sometimes in such problems, they might be looking for the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, perhaps I should consider both cases.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me consider the entire expansion. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe are looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, for each \\(m\\), the term will have \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient for each such term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\).\n\nBut since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum over all possible \\(m\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because each term has a different power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But that would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) = 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, depending on the interpretation, the answer could be either 384 or 120. But I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), so the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but why? Because in the problem statement, it's written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the problem is considering \\(a^2b^2\\) as a standalone term, which would require the \\(c\\) terms to cancel out, leading to \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nI think that's the more precise interpretation because otherwise, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 384, which includes all powers of \\(c\\), but the problem is likely looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\).\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20.\n\n3. Multiply these coefficients together: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit confused because the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\). Let me check online if similar problems exist. Oh, wait, I can't access the internet, but I remember that in such problems, unless specified, the coefficient is considered for the term with the same variables as given, so if it's \\(a^2b^2\\), it's likely that \\(c\\) is supposed to cancel out, making it \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Therefore, the answer is 120.\n\nYes, I think that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) from the second part. \n\n1. From \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. From \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nMultiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " First, I think I need to expand both parts of the expression separately and then see how they combine. \n\nStarting with the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). I remember from algebra that when you expand a binomial like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can use the binomial theorem, which says that each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{n}{k}a^{n - k}b^k\\), right? So in this case, \\(n = 4\\), so the expansion will have terms from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(k = 4\\).\n\nI specifically need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, looking at the binomial expansion, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when the exponents on \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. Since the exponents add up to 4, which is the exponent on the binomial, that makes sense. So the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\). \n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is the number of ways to choose 2 items from 4, that's \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). This looks similar to the first binomial, but now the terms involve \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). I think I can apply the binomial theorem here as well. The expansion will have terms of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\), where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6.\n\nSimplifying each term, \\(\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = c^{-m}\\), so the term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nBut wait, how does this affect the overall coefficient? I think I need to figure out which term in this expansion, when multiplied by the corresponding term from the first binomial, will give me an \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But wait, hold on a second, the first part is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So actually, the variables are different. That means that when I multiply the two expansions together, the variables won't interfere with each other. \n\nSo, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first binomial, and the second binomial's terms involve only \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Therefore, when I multiply the two expressions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be the product of the coefficient from the first part and the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient, perhaps I don't need to consider the second part at all because it doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is the product of two binomials. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of the first binomial will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second binomial. \n\nBut since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the product terms will involve both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) multiplied by powers of \\(c\\). However, the question is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, does that mean I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and then consider how it combines with the entire second part?\n\nWait, no, that can't be right either because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. But actually, no, because each term in the product will be a term from the first expansion multiplied by a term from the second expansion. \n\nBut since the question is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), we're looking for all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nWait, but the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in that expansion is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression equal to 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (the sum of coefficients from the second part)? That would give 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, let me confirm. When we multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. In this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the variables \\(a^2b^2\\) can be paired with any term from the second expansion, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I can treat the two binomials separately and realize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the entire second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so when we multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, but since we are only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient will be 6 multiplied by the entire sum of coefficients in the second part, which is indeed 64. \n\nSo, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. \n\nWait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I can compute the coefficient as follows: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found. Then, the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) for any \\(k\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) where \\(6 - 2m = k\\). But since we don't care about the specific power of \\(c\\), we just need to sum all the coefficients from the second expansion, which is achieved by substituting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we first determine the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we note that the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{384}\n\\]"

    "text": " I remember that when dealing with coefficients in expressions raised to powers, the binomial theorem is super useful. So maybe I can apply that here.\n\nFirst, I think I should handle each part of the expression separately. That is, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then see how it interacts with the other part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, actually, since the two parts are multiplied together, the terms from each expansion will multiply term by term. So maybe I need to consider both expansions and see how they contribute to the overall coefficient.\n\nWait, but the question is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the \\(c\\) terms might not affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms directly. Let me clarify that.\n\nIn the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second. But in this case, the first expression has terms like \\(a^2b^2\\) and the second has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe we need to consider the sum of all coefficients from the second part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part.\n\nWait, that might not make sense. Let me think again. The overall expression is the product of two binomial expansions. So, when you expand both, you'll have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m (1/c)^{6 - m}\\), which simplifies to \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{m - (6 - m)} = a^kb^{4 - k}c^{2m - 6}\\). But we're only interested in the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, i.e., \\(k = 2\\) and \\(4 - k = 2\\), which is correct because \\(2 + 2 = 4\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by all the terms from the second expansion, but since the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product, perhaps we can consider that the coefficient will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But wait, no, that doesn't seem right because each term in the second part has different powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each with different powers of \\(c\\). So, in the overall product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have coefficients multiplied by each of those terms. But the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps we can consider that the coefficient is the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from the second part. Wait, but that might not be correct because each term in the second part has a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), each with their own coefficients. But the original problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term from the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part contributes its coefficient times \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is (coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by (sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)).\n\nWait, that makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those terms contributes their coefficient to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the total coefficient would be the product of the two coefficients.\n\nSo, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^n\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{k}b^{n - k}\\). So, for \\(n = 4\\), the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\binom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNext, we need the sum of the coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because in the product, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, which has different powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) will have coefficients equal to the sum of all coefficients from the second part, each multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. So, yes, that would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) being (6) times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but another way to look at it is that the entire expression is the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each part, but since the second part's expansion has multiple terms, each with their own coefficients, the total contribution is the product of the first coefficient and the sum of the second coefficients.\n\nWait, but let me test this with a smaller example to make sure. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion would be \\(a c + a (1/c) + b c + b (1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first part is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 2 (since \\((c + 1/c)\\) evaluated at \\(c=1\\) is 2). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be 1*2=2, which is correct because in the expansion, \\(a\\) is multiplied by 2 terms, each contributing 1 coefficient, so total coefficient is 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would be 1*2=2.\n\nWait, but in the product, the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are each 2, which makes sense because each is multiplied by both terms in the second expansion. So, yes, that seems to check out.\n\nTherefore, applying this to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe by considering the entire expansion and looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\). Since the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product can only come from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by any term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\binom{4}{2}=6\\), and the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\((1 + 1)^6=64\\), so the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but another thought: the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64, but does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6*64? Because each term in the second expansion is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so each of those 64 terms contributes their coefficient to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, yes, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient is given by \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\).\n\nMultiplying these results gives the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product as \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{384}\\)"
