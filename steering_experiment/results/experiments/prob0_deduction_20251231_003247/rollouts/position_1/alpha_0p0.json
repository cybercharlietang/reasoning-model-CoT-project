    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should expand each part separately and then see how they multiply together. But wait, the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So maybe I don't need to expand everything, just focus on the parts that contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nLet me start with the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). I remember that when you expand a binomial like this, you can use the binomial theorem, which says that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^k\\). So, applying this to \\((a + b)^4\\), each term will be \\(\\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). \n\nSince I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. That means I need \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\). \n\nCalculating that, \\(\\binom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). Got that part.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm supposed to multiply this by the first part, but since I'm only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), I wonder if I need to consider any terms from this expansion. Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the variables are independent. That means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the entire second part, right? Because the second part doesn't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. When I multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second. But since the second expression involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), and the first expression only has \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the variables are separate. So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, no, that's not correct because the second part is a separate factor, so when you multiply, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will just be multiplied by the entire second expression. So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, but that can't be right because the sum of all coefficients in the second part would be when \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). But wait, that would make the coefficient \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\), but that seems too high. Maybe I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that combine to form that term. But in this case, since the second expression only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), and the first expression only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the variables are independent. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression multiplied by the entire expansion of the second expression. But wait, no, that's not correct because the second expression doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire second expression. But that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because we're looking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression. \n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But since the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a separate variable, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. However, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) would affect the exponent of \\(c\\), but we want the term where the exponents cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\), so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nAh, that makes sense. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6.\n\nSo, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\binom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Now, going back to the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me just double-check that. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\). In the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them together gives 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nI think that's the answer. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by multiplying the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " I'm a bit confused because the expression has two variables, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another part with \\(c\\). But I think the key is to focus on the part where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are involved because that's where the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that each term in the expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{n}{k}a^{n - k}b^k\\), where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to \\(n\\). So, in this case, since the exponent is 4, the expansion will have terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\).\n\nI need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means I need the term where the power of \\(a\\) is 2 and the power of \\(b\\) is also 2. Let me write that out. The general term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, if I set \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), then \\(k\\) must be 2 because \\(4 - 2 = 2\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^{2}b^{2}\\).\n\nNow, I need to calculate \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). I remember that the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{n}{k}\\) is calculated as \\(\\dfrac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\\). So, plugging in the numbers, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part is 6.\n\nWait, but the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that mean I need to consider the expansion of both parts and multiply them together? Hmm, but I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) is in the second part, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all. So, maybe I don't need to worry about the second part when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. Because the entire expression is the product of two expansions, each term in the product will be a term from the first expansion multiplied by a term from the second expansion. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all possible products where the term from the first part is \\(a^2b^2\\) and the term from the second part is any term, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part.\n\nWait, but that might not be the case. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\), each term in the expansion of the first part is multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, but that seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part isn't being multiplied by \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, but the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is independent of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because each term in the product is a term from the first expansion times a term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part because each term in the second part is a constant (with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)) that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Let me denote the first part as \\(A = (a + b)^4\\) and the second part as \\(B = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, the product is \\(A \\times B\\). Now, \\(A\\) has terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), while \\(B\\) has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find all terms in \\(A \\times B\\) where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\) times some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests that it's looking for the coefficient when \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But that can't be right because the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which usually refers to the coefficient when \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a term that doesn't involve other variables, i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). Wait, but that might not be the case. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Hmm, that's unclear.\n\nWait, actually, looking back at the problem: it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, perhaps it's considering the entire expression as a polynomial in variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire expansion of the second part because each term in the second part is a separate term that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not another polynomial. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, maybe the problem is actually only considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term (i.e., the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero) in the second expansion. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the entire product. That is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion.\n\nIf that's the case, then I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion, and that would give me the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\).\n\nSo, let's proceed with that approach.\n\nFirst, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the constant term, I can use the binomial expansion again. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). The exponent on \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the exponent to be zero for the constant term, so:\n\n\\(6 - 2k = 0\\)\n\nSolving for \\(k\\):\n\n\\(2k = 6\\)\n\n\\(k = 3\\)\n\nSo, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that:\n\n\\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\)\n\nSo, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the two coefficients: 6 (from the first part) times 20 (from the constant term in the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the product. If the problem is only considering the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in \\(c\\), then 120 is the answer. But if the problem is considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but that's not possible because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient when \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in \\(c\\), so the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, without considering \\(c\\). That is, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the part \\((a + b)^4\\) and ignoring the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part, but that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. So, I think the correct approach is to consider the constant term in the second part and multiply it by the coefficient from the first part.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\): that's 6.\n2. Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\): that's 20.\n3. Multiply them together: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\) expansion: the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). That's correct.\n\nSecond, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\): the constant term is when the exponent on \\(c\\) is zero. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). Setting \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) gives \\(k = 3\\). Then, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). That's correct.\n\nMultiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. So, yes, that's the correct coefficient.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient from this part is 6.\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The general term in the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   To find the constant term, set the exponent of \\(c\\) to zero:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The constant term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients:**\n   Multiply the coefficient from the first part by the constant term from the second part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Let me write that out. For \\((a + b)^4\\), \\(n = 4\\), so the expansion will be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\n\nThat means the terms will be:\n\n- When \\(k = 0\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 = 1 \\cdot a^4 \\cdot 1 = a^4\\)\n- When \\(k = 1\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 = 4a^3b\\)\n- When \\(k = 2\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\)\n- When \\(k = 3\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 = 4ab^3\\)\n- When \\(k = 4\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4 = 1 \\cdot b^4 = b^4\\)\n\nSo, from this, I can see that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. But wait, the problem isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I need to consider the entire expression.\n\nLet me think. The coefficient I found, 6, is just from the first part. But since the entire expression is the product of two expansions, I need to consider how the terms multiply together. Specifically, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. But wait, actually, the \\(c\\) terms are separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so maybe the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term? Hmm, that might not be correct. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, actually, the entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we don't care about the \\(c\\) terms, right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is only part of the first factor, and the second factor only contributes terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), because when you multiply by the other expansion, it doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, does that mean the coefficient is still 6?\n\nWait, that seems too straightforward. Let me verify. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(6a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is another expansion. When you multiply them, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the other expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we only need the term where the power of \\(a\\) is 2 and the power of \\(b\\) is 2. The \\(c\\) terms, whether they are \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, actually, no. Because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the other expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms can be anything because they don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because that would make the coefficient much larger.\n\nWait, no, actually, that's not correct. Let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not quite right either because each term in the product is a combination of an \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) term and a \\(c\\) term. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not correct because each term in the product is a combination of an \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) term and a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by each term in the other expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent.\n\nWait, but that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me compute that sum. The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), if I set \\(c = 1\\), the sum of the coefficients is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, but that seems too large. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms. So, in this case, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), you only need the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) and any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that when you multiply the two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a^2b^2, and when multiplied by each term in the other expansion, which is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in the product will be 6a^2b^2 multiplied by \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm still not sure if that's correct.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present, and its coefficient will be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible terms. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nBut let me check this another way. Let's consider that \\((a + b)^4\\) has 6a^2b^2, and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is another expansion. When you multiply them, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the other expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is (1 + 1)^6 = 64, then 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nBut wait, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the coefficient is 6. The other polynomial, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), contributes all its terms, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Maybe I should think of it as the product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the coefficient of any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is some number, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But that seems a bit off because each term in the product is a combination of an \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) term and a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so we're only concerned with the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts, and the \\(c\\) parts can be anything. So, in the product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by all possible terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is simpler. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest of the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect it. So, the coefficient is 6.\n\nWait, that makes sense because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in one part is independent of the other part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. So, perhaps the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the \\(c\\) terms don't affect it because they are separate variables.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the other expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product isn't just 6; it's 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the other polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number.\n\nWait, I think I'm confusing the terms. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself has a coefficient that includes all the terms from the other expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which isn't possible because coefficients are numbers. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), meaning we need to sum over all possible coefficients from the \\(c\\) terms.\n\nWait, that might make sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum over all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). So, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nBut I'm still a bit unsure because I'm not sure if the problem expects just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, or if it's expecting the product with the other expansion. Let me try to think of a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion would be \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 (from \\(a\\)) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\((c + 1/c)\\), which would give terms like \\(ac + a/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product is the expansion of \\((c + 1/c)\\), which is \\(c + 1/c\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. But that doesn't give a numerical coefficient; it gives a polynomial.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and not considering the \\(c\\) terms. But that seems unlikely because the entire expression includes the \\(c\\) terms.\n\nWait, another approach: since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the expression is a product of two independent expansions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in each factor. But that's not correct because the second factor doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first factor, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial. But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number.\n\nI think I'm stuck here. Let me try to look up similar problems or recall if there's a formula for this. Wait, I remember that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. But in this case, since the second polynomial only has \\(c\\) terms, and the first has \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, the exponents don't interfere. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That would make sense because then we're looking for a specific term where \\(c\\) cancels out. So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the coefficient where the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, in that case, we need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which would be when the exponents from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel each other out.\n\nSo, let me try that approach. Let me first find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(c^0\\) occurs when the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) add up to zero. So, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, the problem is probably asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nBut let me make sure. The original problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which isn't a number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and since the \\(c\\) terms are separate, the coefficient is 6. But that seems too simple, and I think the problem is more likely expecting the coefficient considering the entire expression, including the \\(c\\) terms.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is miswritten, or I'm misinterpreting it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, but that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. So, perhaps the intended question is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nGiven that, I think the correct answer is 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120 when considering the \\(c\\) terms that cancel out.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me compute the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), as I found earlier. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the term is \\(20c^0 = 20\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6, but that seems unlikely because the expression includes \\(c\\) terms. So, I think the intended answer is 120.\n\nWait, but to confirm, let me think about the entire product. When you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the product is of the form \\(\\text{(term from first expansion)} \\times \\text{(term from second expansion)}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is not just 6; it's 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we need to consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). We are looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when the exponents from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel each other out. The general term in this expansion is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so we solve:\n\\[\n6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n\\]\nThe coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nFinally, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each expansion:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " I'm a bit confused because the expression has two parts multiplied together, each raised to a power. I think I can handle each part separately and then combine them somehow, but I'm not entirely sure how yet.\n\nFirst, let's break down the problem. The entire expression is a product of two binomials, each raised to a power: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I probably don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, maybe I can find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then see how it interacts with the other part.\n\nLet me start with \\((a + b)^4\\). I remember that when expanding a binomial like \\((a + b)^n\\), the coefficients can be found using the binomial theorem, which states that:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\n\\]\n\nSo, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}ab^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}b^4\n\\]\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} = 1\\), so the first term is \\(a^4\\).\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} = 4\\), so the second term is \\(4a^3b\\).\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), so the third term is \\(6a^2b^2\\).\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} = 4\\), so the fourth term is \\(4ab^3\\).\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} = 1\\), so the last term is \\(b^4\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. So far, so good.\n\nNow, the original problem is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression is:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\n\\]\n\nSince I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider how this term interacts with the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part. However, since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to see if any of the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will affect the exponent of \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). But they won't because \\(c\\) is a separate variable. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and when I multiply it by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes to the overall coefficient.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit off. Let me clarify. When you have two expressions multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each factor. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(c\\) is a different variable, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first factor will be multiplied by each term in the second factor. However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut wait, that might not be correct. Let me think differently. Maybe I should consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will only be affected by the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that have \\(c^0\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, actually, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), I get \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term we're interested in.\n\nYes, that makes more sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, first, I already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nLet me use the binomial theorem again for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). I need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because \\(c^0 = 1\\), which is the constant term.\n\nSo, set the exponent equal to 0:\n\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(k\\):\n\n\\[\n6 = 2k \\implies k = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the term where \\(k = 3\\) is the constant term. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3! \\cdot (6 - 3)!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\cdot 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\n\\]\n\nWait, let me check that calculation again. Actually, \\(6! = 720\\), \\(3! = 6\\), so:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\n\\]\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients: 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) and 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)).\n\nCalculating that:\n\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. I considered that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part would be multiplied by the constant term in the second part, which is correct because any other term would introduce a power of \\(c\\), which we don't want since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\). So, by multiplying 6 and 20, I get 120. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of the entire expression as a product, and when expanding, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first part, and we need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), but actually, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by terms involving \\(c\\), you'd get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but since we're looking for just \\(a^2b^2\\), we need the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero. Therefore, only the constant term in the second part contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, multiplying 6 by 20 gives 120.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. Let me just recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem and find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20.\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together to get 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning now.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"

    "text": " I remember that when dealing with expressions raised to a power, the binomial theorem is really useful. Maybe I should start by expanding each part separately and then see how they combine.\n\nFirst, let's look at \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, which states that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^k\\), I can expand this. So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion will be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\n\\]\n\nCalculating the coefficients, \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} = 1\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} = 4\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} = 4\\), and \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} = 1\\). So, the expansion becomes:\n\n\\[\na^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nOkay, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6. But wait, the problem asks for the coefficient in the product of this expression with \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That means I need to consider how the terms from each expansion multiply together.\n\nLet me now expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, this becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the exponents, each term will have \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 + \\dbinom{6}{1}c^4 + \\dbinom{6}{2}c^2 + \\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 + \\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} + \\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} + \\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6}\n\\]\n\nCalculating the coefficients, \\(\\dbinom{6}{0} = 1\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{1} = 6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{2} = 15\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{4} = 15\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{5} = 6\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{6} = 1\\). So, the expansion becomes:\n\n\\[\nc^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\n\\]\n\nAlright, now I have both expansions. The original expression is the product of these two expansions. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will multiply each term in the second expansion.\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). In the first expansion, \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6, as I found earlier. Now, when I multiply this term by the entire second expansion, each term in the second expansion will be multiplied by 6. However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider how the multiplication affects the variables.\n\nWait a second, actually, no. Because in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will multiply each term in the second expansion, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think again. Each term in the first expansion is a monomial in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and each term in the second expansion is a monomial in \\(c\\). So, when we multiply them, the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nBut wait, is that right? Let me check. Suppose I have \\( (a + b)^4 = P \\) and \\( \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = Q \\). Then, the product \\( P \\times Q \\) will have terms like \\( a^4 \\times c^6 \\), \\( a^4 \\times 6c^4 \\), etc. Similarly, \\( a^3b \\) will multiply each term in Q, and so on. But the term \\( a^2b^2 \\) in P will multiply each term in Q, resulting in terms like \\( 6a^2b^2c^6 \\), \\( 6a^2b^2c^4 \\), \\( 6a^2b^2c^2 \\), \\( 6a^2b^2 \\times 20 \\), and so on. So, all these terms will have \\( a^2b^2 \\) multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q, because each term in Q contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's actually considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient will indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in Q.\n\nBut let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that each term in Q is a separate term, so when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in Q, each resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in Q, because each term in Q contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, first, let me find the sum of all coefficients in Q. The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, in Q, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), if I set \\(c = 1\\), then each term becomes its coefficient. So, the sum of coefficients is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because in the expansion of Q, each term is a different power of c, so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in Q, you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of c. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all coefficients from Q multiplied by 6, because each term in Q contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nBut wait, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. But let me think differently. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is 6a^2b^2, and when multiplied by each term in the second expansion, it becomes 6a^2b^2 times each term in Q. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in Q, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check with a smaller example to see if this approach is correct. Suppose I have (a + b)^2 * (c + 1/c)^1. Let's compute the coefficient of a^2b^2.\n\nFirst, (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2. The coefficient of a^2b^2 is 0 because in (a + b)^2, the highest power is a^2 and b^2, but a^2b^2 isn't present. So, the coefficient is 0.\n\nWait, but in this case, the coefficient of a^2b^2 in (a + b)^2 is 0, so when multiplied by (c + 1/c), the coefficient remains 0. That makes sense.\n\nAnother example: (a + b)^3 * (c + 1/c)^2. The coefficient of a^2b in (a + b)^3 is 3. The sum of coefficients in (c + 1/c)^2 is (1 + 1)^2 = 4. So, the coefficient of a^2b would be 3 * 4 = 12. But wait, actually, in the product, a^2b would multiply each term in (c + 1/c)^2, so the coefficient would be 3 times the sum of coefficients in (c + 1/c)^2, which is 3 * 4 = 12. That seems correct.\n\nBut in our original problem, the coefficient of a^2b^2 in (a + b)^4 is 6, and the sum of coefficients in (c + 1/c)^6 is 64, so the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the product equal to the coefficient in the first part times the sum of coefficients in the second part? Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that term.\n\nIn this case, since a^2b^2 is independent of c, any term in the second expansion will multiply a^2b^2, and each such term contributes its coefficient times 6. So, yes, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nTherefore, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with another approach. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the entire expression is a product of two independent polynomials, so the coefficient of a^2b^2 is indeed 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when you have products, you have to consider cross terms, but in this case, since a and b are separate from c, their coefficients multiply directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the first part times the coefficient of any term in the second part, but since the second part is multiplied by a^2b^2, it's effectively scaling the coefficient by the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think 384 is the correct coefficient.\n\nWait, but let me make sure by actually computing a small part. Let's say I take the term 6a^2b^2 from the first expansion and multiply it by each term in the second expansion:\n\n6a^2b^2 * c^6 = 6a^2b^2c^6\n\n6a^2b^2 * 6c^4 = 36a^2b^2c^4\n\n6a^2b^2 * 15c^2 = 90a^2b^2c^2\n\n6a^2b^2 * 20 = 120a^2b^2\n\n6a^2b^2 * 15c^{-2} = 90a^2b^2c^{-2}\n\n6a^2b^2 * 6c^{-4} = 36a^2b^2c^{-4}\n\n6a^2b^2 * c^{-6} = 6a^2b^2c^{-6}\n\nNow, each of these terms has a coefficient for a^2b^2 multiplied by different powers of c. So, in the entire product, the coefficient of a^2b^2 is the sum of all these coefficients, which is:\n\n6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6\n\nLet me add these up:\n\n6 + 36 = 42\n\n42 + 90 = 132\n\n132 + 120 = 252\n\n252 + 90 = 342\n\n342 + 36 = 378\n\n378 + 6 = 384\n\nYes, that adds up to 384. So, the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the entire product is indeed 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again: the problem is asking for the coefficient of a^2b^2, regardless of the power of c. So, in the product, a^2b^2 can be multiplied by any power of c, but the coefficient is the same across all these terms. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of a^2b^2c^k for some specific k, then it would be different, but since it's just a^2b^2, it's the sum of all coefficients where a^2b^2 is multiplied by any power of c.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check my earlier step where I calculated the sum of coefficients in Q. I set c = 1, so Q becomes (1 + 1)^6 = 64, which is correct. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the product of the two polynomials, and the coefficient of a^2b^2 is the product of the coefficients of a^2b^2 in the first polynomial and the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial. Since the variables are independent, this approach works.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts and then combine the results.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}ab^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}b^4\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\).\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first expansion (6) multiplied by the sum of coefficients from the second expansion (64), resulting in \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " I'm a bit rusty on my binomial expansions, but I think I can handle this.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((x + y)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem, which involves combinations. The binomial theorem states that:\n\n\\[\n(x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^{k}\n\\]\n\nSo, I think I can apply this theorem to both parts of the given expression separately and then multiply the results together.\n\nLet me break it down. The expression has two parts: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Once I find that, I might also need to consider the coefficients from the other part, but wait, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) specifically, I think that the other part involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) will just multiply the entire expansion, so maybe I can treat them separately.\n\nWait, actually, no. The entire expression is a product of two expansions, so the terms from each expansion will multiply each other. But since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only comes from the first part \\((a + b)^4\\), maybe the other part doesn't affect this term? Hmm, that doesn't seem right because when you multiply the two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will multiply each term from the second expansion. But \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term in the first part, so when you multiply it by any term from the second part, it will create terms involving \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's just the coefficient from the first part, and the second part's coefficients will multiply it, but maybe the second part's terms don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, no, that can't be. Because when you multiply the two expansions, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion and the constant term (i.e., the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero) in the second expansion. Because if I take any other term from the second expansion, it would introduce a \\(c\\) term, which would make the product have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot 1/c^k\\), but since the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), those other terms wouldn't contribute to that specific term. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part.\n\nWait, let me think again. Let me structure this properly.\n\nFirst, let me expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The general term is:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\n\\]\n\nI need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) because when I multiply the two expansions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will only contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the overall product if the second part contributes a \\(c^0\\) term. Because if it's \\(c^k\\) or \\(1/c^k\\), then the product would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot 1/c^k\\), which are different terms. So, I need the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nSo, expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the general term is:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nWe want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so:\n\n\\[\n6 - 2m = 0 \\implies 2m = 6 \\implies m = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the constant term. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20.\n\nNow, since the two expansions are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from the first expansion) multiplied by 20 (from the second expansion). So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through this again.\n\nFirst, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Correct.\n\nIn \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, as I did before, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\), and setting exponent to zero gives \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Then, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Correct.\n\nSo, the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me think again: when I multiply the two expansions together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion, which has a coefficient of 6, is multiplied by every term from the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only be the case if the second expansion contributes a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), i.e., the constant term. Because if it's multiplied by a \\(c\\) term, then the resulting term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is a different term than \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, only the constant term from the second expansion will contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this by expanding a bit more carefully.\n\nLet me denote the first expansion as \\(E_1 = (a + b)^4\\) and the second as \\(E_2 = \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, \\(E_1\\) can be written as:\n\n\\[\nE_1 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, \\(E_2\\) can be written as:\n\n\\[\nE_2 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nNow, when we multiply \\(E_1\\) and \\(E_2\\), the product is:\n\n\\[\nE_1 \\cdot E_2 = \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k} \\right) \\cdot \\left( \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m} \\right)\n\\]\n\nExpanding this product, each term in \\(E_1\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(E_2\\), so the product becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{4}{k} \\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k} b^{k} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nNow, we're interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means we need to find all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, in the product, each term is \\(a^{4 - k}b^{k}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, if we want the term \\(a^2b^2\\), we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), which we've already determined. But then, for each such term, the exponent of \\(c\\) will be \\(6 - 2m\\). So, unless we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some \\(c\\) term, but the problem is just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply that the exponent of \\(c\\) must be zero. Therefore, we need both \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), and \\(6 - 2m = 0\\).\n\nSo, in this case, \\(k = 2\\) and \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Suppose I didn't consider the \\(c\\) terms, would that affect the coefficient? For example, if I only took the coefficient from the first part and ignored the second part, would that be correct? I don't think so because the entire expression is a product, so each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but only the term where \\(c^0\\) will result in a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms will have an extra \\(c\\) factor, which would make them different terms. So, only the \\(c^0\\) term in the second expansion will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me consider another approach. Maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product and then consider how the terms interact. So, the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I expand each part separately, I get two polynomials, and when multiplied together, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term in the first polynomial is 6a^2b^2. Then, when multiplied by the second polynomial, which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), \\(1/c^6\\), the product will have terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(120a^2b^2\\), \\(90a^2b^2/c^2\\), \\(36a^2b^2/c^4\\), \\(6a^2b^2/c^6\\). So, in this product, the only term that is \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is \\(120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think I can confidently say that the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem to expand each part separately and then consider the relevant terms.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the general term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), which occurs when \\(k = 2\\).

So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLooking at the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), I want to find the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\). That would be when the exponent on \\(a\\) is 2 and the exponent on \\(b\\) is 2. Since the exponents have to add up to 4 (because it's the 4th power), that makes sense because 2 + 2 = 4.\n\nUsing the binomial coefficient formula, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is equal to \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I notice that this is another binomial expression, so I can expand it using the binomial theorem as well. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all. That seems confusing because the second part has \\(c\\) terms. \n\nWait a minute, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again. It says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, actually, the entire expression is a product of two binomials raised to powers, but we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means we don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). \n\nHmm, so does that mean the coefficient is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6? Because when you multiply by the second part, any term involving \\(c\\) would add variables, but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms must be multiplied by 1, right? Wait, that doesn't seem right because the second part is raised to the 6th power, so it's more complicated than that.\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since we're only looking for the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what happens with the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is multiplied by the first part, so every term in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. \n\nWait, but if we're only interested in the term \\(a^2b^2\\), then we don't care about the \\(c\\) terms at all. So, the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second part evaluated at whatever, but since we don't care about the \\(c\\) terms, maybe it's just 6 times 1? That doesn't seem right because the second part is a sum of terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\).\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these out, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, if I'm looking for a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), it must come from the first part, and then multiplied by some term from the second part. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion, which is the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out.\n\nSo, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero for the constant term. So, 6 - 2k = 0, which gives k = 3.\n\nTherefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part has a coefficient of 6, and it's multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, the coefficient from the first part is 6, and the constant term from the second part is 20. So, when you multiply those together, you get 120.

So, yeah, it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's the correct approach. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

But since the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. But wait, no, that's not correct because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a single term, and when you multiply it by each term from the second expansion, each of those products will be separate terms in the final expansion.

But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient is a number, not an expression. I must be making a mistake here.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is a product of two polynomials. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various exponents \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second part, each of those will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Wait, no, that's not correct because the coefficient is a number, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. \n\nWait, let me clarify. Let's denote the first part as \\(P(a, b) = (a + b)^4\\) and the second part as \\(Q(c) = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, the entire expression is \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\). When you multiply them, each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from \\(-6\\) to \\(6\\) in steps of 2, I think. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients from \\(Q(c)\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\). \n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(Q(c)\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), each term contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times that term. But actually, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by, say, \\(c^3\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^3\\), which is a different term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) because \\(Q(c)\\) doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts. Wait, that can't be right because \\(Q(c)\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(P(a, b)\\). \n\nWait, I think I'm confusing myself. Let me try to write it out more formally. Let me denote the expansion of \\(P(a, b)\\) as \\(\\sum_{i=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{i} a^{4 - i} b^i\\) and the expansion of \\(Q(c)\\) as \\(\\sum_{j=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{j} c^{6 - j} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^j = \\sum_{j=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{j} c^{6 - 2j}\\). \n\nThen, the product \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\) is \\(\\sum_{i=0}^4 \\sum_{j=0}^6 \\dbinom{4}{i} \\dbinom{6}{j} a^{4 - i} b^i c^{6 - 2j}\\). \n\nNow, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(a^{2}b^{2}\\), which occurs when \\(4 - i = 2\\) and \\(i = 2\\). So, for each \\(j\\), the term \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2j}\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\dbinom{6}{j}\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients of terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\sum_{j=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{j}\\). \n\nWait, that seems correct. Because for each \\(j\\), the term \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2j}\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\dbinom{6}{j}\\), so the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{j}\\) for \\(j = 0\\) to \\(6\\). \n\nBut the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{j}\\) from \\(j=0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times 64\\). \n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), so \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but that seems too large. Let me check my reasoning again. \n\nWhen I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and it's multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first part, and when multiplied by each term in the second part, each of those products will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part, but since the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if I think of the entire expression as a product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part where the variables match. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's just the coefficient from the first part times the entire second part's coefficients summed up. \n\nSo, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Or maybe the entire expression is multiplied, but since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are different variables, their exponents don't interfere with each other. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire second part? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when we multiply, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, and the second part would contribute a factor that is the sum of all its terms. Hmm, but that seems conflicting.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two expressions together, each term from the first expansion will multiply each term from the second expansion. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of those involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. But that doesn't seem right because the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not any specific term in \\(c\\).\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you multiply the two expressions, each term in the first expression will multiply each term in the second, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first part, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all terms in the second expansion. But that seems odd because the sum of all terms in the second expansion would be a number, and then the coefficient would be 6 times that number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second expression. Wait, but that would require evaluating the second expression at \\(c = 1\\), because then each term's coefficient is just the coefficient, and the sum would be the total sum of coefficients.\n\nWait, let me check that. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expression is 64. Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems high. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that each term in the second expression is multiplied by the term in the first expression, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second expression, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, not an expression.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since the problem is asking for the coefficient, maybe it's just 6. But that doesn't seem right because the problem includes the second part.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that when you multiply the two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first part, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is when \\(c = 1\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. Let's expand both expressions. The first expression, \\((a + b)^4\\), has terms \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). The second expression, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), expands to terms with various powers of \\(c\\). When we multiply these together, each term in the first will multiply each term in the second, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first will be multiplied by every term in the second. Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. Since the sum of coefficients in the second expression is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\), then the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nBut let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the coefficient without any \\(c\\) terms, but I don't think so because the problem includes both parts. So, the way it works is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and the problem is just asking for the coefficient in the first part, but that seems unlikely because the entire expression is given as a product. So, I think the correct approach is to compute the coefficient in the first part and then multiply by the sum of the coefficients in the second part, giving 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you have two separate expressions multiplied together, the coefficients of the product are the products of the coefficients from each expression. So, for example, if you have \\( (x + y)(z + w) \\), the coefficient of \\(x z\\) is 1 * 1 = 1, and so on. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply, each term in the second part will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), making the coefficient 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm by calculating the sum of coefficients in the second expression. The second expression is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum is 64, and the coefficient from the first part is 6, so 6 * 64 = 384. That makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then it would be different, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, which is 384.\n\nSo, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " I'm a bit confused because the expression involves two different parts multiplied together, each raised to a power. I think I should handle each part separately and then see how they combine.\n\nFirst, let's look at \\((a + b)^4\\). I remember from the binomial theorem that when expanding \\((x + y)^n\\), the coefficient of \\(x^k y^{n - k}\\) is given by the combination \\(\\dbinom{n}{k}\\). So in this case, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but this part involves \\(c\\). Wait, does this part affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms? Hmm, I think not, because \\(c\\) is a different variable. So, maybe the \\(c\\) terms don't interact with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) when we multiply the two expressions together. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second part? Or wait, no, because when we multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), maybe the \\(c\\) terms don't influence the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times whatever the entire second expression is, but that doesn't make sense because the second expression is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of the two expressions. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second, when we multiply the two, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't be multiplied by any \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second part evaluated as a constant, but that doesn't seem right because the second part isn't a constant; it's a sum of terms in \\(c\\).\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible terms. But since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, and the second part doesn't affect it. So, the coefficient would be 6 times whatever the second part contributes, but since the second part is a separate polynomial, maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the entire second expression. But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a numerical value, not a polynomial in \\(c\\).\n\nWait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, which are terms involving \\(c^k\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 6 down to -6 in steps of 2, I think.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), and so on. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that we're looking for the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, right? Because otherwise, if we have \\(c\\) terms, the term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but if \\(k\\) is not zero, then it's not just \\(a^2b^2\\), it's \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), but that doesn't seem right because then it would involve summing over all the coefficients in the second part, which would be complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a scalar. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible terms, but only the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, so that the term is just \\(a^2b^2\\). That makes more sense.\n\nSo, in other words, we need to find the term in the expansion where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. Therefore, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part.\n\nSo, let's break it down:\n\n1. Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as calculated earlier.\n\n2. Coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, how do we find that?\n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, but this time for the expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\) so \\(k = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let's calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from the second part, and when we multiply these two terms together, we get \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1 = a^2b^2\\), and the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of the entire product as \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and when expanding, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by all the terms in the second part, but only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), because any other term would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, making it \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) instead of just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, only the constant term in the second part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product.\n\nSo, yeah, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients, let me verify:\n\nFor \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Correct.\n\nFor \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Correct.\n\nSo, 6 times 20 is indeed 120.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression has coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) in the second expression has coefficient 20. Therefore, when multiplied together, they contribute \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we consider each part separately.\n\n1. **Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). Setting \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) gives \\(k = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients:**\n   Multiply the coefficients from each part: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with expansions like \\((a + b)^n\\), the coefficients can be found using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem states that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^{k}\\). So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), I can expand this and look for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2.\n\nLet me write that out. The general term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\). I need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), which means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider this as well. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and this part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), I think the terms involving \\(c\\) won't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I just need to consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the term that contributes to the overall coefficient when multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.\n\nWait, but actually, when I multiply the two expansions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) for the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), because if I'm only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms would be multiplied by 1 or something, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), it would come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because any other term involving \\(c\\) would result in a term that includes \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which we don't want when looking for just \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, that's 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)).\n\nCalculating that, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying them together gives 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider if there's any other term in the second expansion that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without involving \\(c\\). But since \\(c\\) and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, any term involving \\(c\\) would have to be multiplied by a term that cancels out the \\(c\\), but in the first part, there's no \\(c\\), so the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) is by multiplying by the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nWait, another thought: if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then yes, it would be 120. But the problem just says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which might imply that we're considering the expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is any power. But no, actually, when the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", it's probably considering the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), but the question is a bit ambiguous.\n\nWait, no, I think I'm overcomplicating. In the problem, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so it's likely that we're considering the entire product, and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that can't be right because each term in the product will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms multiplied by \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), but that seems unusual. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo, and the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would make sense, and then the answer would be 120.\n\nWait, but let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's specifically asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), without any mention of \\(c\\). Hmm, so perhaps the problem is considering the product as a polynomial in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), treating \\(c\\) as a variable separate from them, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems odd because the problem just asks for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of a term that also includes some power of \\(c\\), but since the problem doesn't specify, maybe I'm supposed to treat \\(c\\) as a separate variable and find the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\)'s power. But that doesn't make much sense because each term in the product would have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) raised to some power and \\(c\\) raised to some other power.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't typical. So, maybe I should proceed under that assumption.\n\nIn that case, as I did earlier, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. So, the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think again. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient itself a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). So, that would be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, but that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a single number. So, perhaps the problem is intended to have \\(c\\) be a specific value, but since it's not given, maybe the problem is only considering the part of the expression that doesn't involve \\(c\\), which would again be the constant term. So, I think 120 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, let me check my calculations again to be thorough. The binomial coefficient for \\((a + b)^4\\) at \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), that's correct. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Yep, that's correct.\n\nI think I'm confident that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the general term in the expansion is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\).

    "text": " I'm a bit rusty on binomial expansions, but I think I can work through it.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression raised to a power like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^{k}\\). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nThe problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I'm looking for the term where the power of \\(a\\) is 2 and the power of \\(b\\) is 2 in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me write that down.\n\nIn \\((a + b)^4\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\). I need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would mean \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, plugging that in, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nWait, but the original problem isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider the entire expression and how the terms combine.\n\nBut wait, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), right? Because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the second part. So, when I multiply the two expansions together, the terms from the first expansion will multiply the terms from the second expansion.\n\nBut since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term is entirely from the first part, and the second part will contribute a factor that might be multiplied by it. But wait, actually, no. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part is in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the multiplication won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so when multiplied, each term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), it would mean that we're looking for the term where the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, i.e., the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nWait, that's a key point. Let me clarify. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we're looking for the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) (which is a term with \\(a^2b^2\\)) and the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) in the second expansion. Because any other term in the second expansion would involve \\(c\\) raised to some power, making the entire term have \\(c\\) in it, which isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the only way to get a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, the product will give me the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression.\n\nOkay, so now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me use the binomial theorem again for this. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\).\n\nSimplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) and solve for \\(k\\).\n\n\\(6 - 2k = 0\\)\n\\(2k = 6\\)\n\\(k = 3\\)\n\nSo, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that's not right. Wait, 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 6!/(3!3!) = 720/(6\u00d76) = 720/36 = 20. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the constant term in the second part is 20. So, when we multiply these together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me double-check the steps.\n\n1. Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Setting exponent to 0 gives \\(k = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. So, the constant term is 20.\n\n4. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But wait, another way to think about it is that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by the constant term of the second expansion, which is 20, giving 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me consider if there's any other way the \\(a^2b^2\\) term could be formed. For example, could the second expansion contribute to the \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms? But no, because the second expansion only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so it doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Therefore, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the first expansion, multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion.\n\nTherefore, I think the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me write out the entire expansion to confirm. Although that might take some time, but maybe for a few terms to see if that makes sense.\n\nBut perhaps another approach is to recognize that since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other part is in \\(c\\), the two parts are independent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term in the second part.\n\nSo, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients, let me verify:\n\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is indeed 6 because 4 \u00d7 3 / 2 \u00d7 1 = 6.\n\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is indeed 20 because 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 / 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 20.\n\nSo, 6 \u00d7 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the final answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the general term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   We need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\).

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that each term in the expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\), where \\(\\dbinom{n}{k}\\) is the binomial coefficient, which can be found using combinations or Pascal's triangle. \n\nSo, for \\((a + b)^4\\), I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which would be \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me write that down. \n\nThe general term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). I want the term where the exponent of \\(a\\) is 2, so \\(4 - k = 2\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but wait, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? \n\nLet me think. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part of the expression and \\(c\\) is in the other, when I multiply them together, the terms from \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will combine. However, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\), so when I multiply, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), right? \n\nHold on, maybe I'm missing something. Let me double-check. The expression is the product of two binomials: one with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering any \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, effectively contributing their coefficients to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes terms with different powers of \\(c\\). But since the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that means we need to sum the products of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part with each term in the second part. \n\nBut that can't be right because that would make the coefficient depend on all the terms in the second part, which is not the case. I think I'm confusing something here. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. That means we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that we need to take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and multiply it by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing their coefficients to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, that seems plausible. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it's equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut how do I find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Well, the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all the variables. So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me think again. Is that correct? Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in the factors. But in this case, we are dealing with variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first polynomial, and when multiplied by any term from the second polynomial, it will still be \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that we need to sum the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for all possible \\(k\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first polynomial, and when multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it will produce terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), ..., up to \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the entire product would actually be the sum of all coefficients of terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64. \n\nSo, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384. \n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the expression is a product of two independent polynomials, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is simply the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. In this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is independent of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by any term in the second polynomial, it will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nSo, as calculated before, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nI think that makes sense. To double-check, maybe I can compute the product of the two expansions and see what the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is. \n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n\\]\n\nSo, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\).\n\nNext, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) for \\(m\\) from 0 to 6.\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the product will have terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). \n\nBut \\(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nYes, that confirms it. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 384.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the sum of coefficients. The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting all variables with 1. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), which matches the sum of the binomial coefficients for \\(n = 6\\). \n\nTherefore, my reasoning seems solid. The coefficient is 384.\n\nI think I've thought this through thoroughly. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations or reasoning. So, I'm confident that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, the term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results**:\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of coefficients from the second part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer**: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

Since these are multiplied together, I think I can handle each part separately and then combine the results. That is, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and then see how it interacts with the second part. But wait, actually, since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part? Or maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nLet me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). The other part of the expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when we multiply the two expansions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient should just be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the first polynomial, then in the product, this term will be multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the expansion of the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), and the first part is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, actually, when we multiply them, each term from the first will be multiplied by each term from the second, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the entire second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is just the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, but that might not be right either because the second part has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion, meaning that the coefficient is actually the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. But that can't be because the sum of coefficients in the second part is when \\(c = 1\\), so maybe substituting \\(c = 1\\) in the second part gives the sum of its coefficients.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to approach it differently. Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that since the second part is independent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is treating \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) as separate variables, and we're looking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But that's not the case because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes to the product, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself in the product would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient times \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is (coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by (sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)).\n\nSo, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^n\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^n \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, for \\(n = 4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(n - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6.\n\nNext, we need the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients of a polynomial is found by substituting 1 for all variables. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Because sometimes when you have variables in the denominator, you have to be careful about the exponents, but in this case, since we're substituting \\(c = 1\\), it's just 2^6, which is 64. So, yes, that part seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for each \\(k\\), and the sum of these coefficients is indeed \\(\\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\).\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm interpreting the problem correctly. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are terms like \\(c^k\\) and \\(c^{-k}\\). So, each of those would contribute to terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself, without any \\(c\\) terms, would actually be zero because there's no term without \\(c\\) in the second expansion. Wait, that contradicts what I thought earlier.\n\nWait, now I'm confused. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which includes terms with \\(c^k\\) and \\(c^{-k}\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear multiplied by each of these \\(c\\) terms, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be zero because \\(a^2b^2\\) is not present as a standalone term without any \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product. But in the product, each term is a combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in the product, but it's multiplied by all possible terms from the second expansion. But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient to the product when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but if I think about it, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in the product, and its coefficient is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, since the second part has a sum of coefficients equal to 64, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider the entire expansion. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} \\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k} b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and then \\(m\\) can be anything from 0 to 6, because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\). Wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), but in the product, each term has a \\(c\\) exponent. So, to have \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, we need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Wait, that's different. So, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, now I'm really confused. Let me try to clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, in the product, each term is a combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in the product, but it's multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients where the \\(c\\) exponents cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the product where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, that would require that in the second expansion, the term is \\(c^0\\), which is the middle term when \\(m = 3\\), because \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) when \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nWait, so then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. That is, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, so now I'm getting a different answer. Earlier, I thought it was 384, but now I'm thinking it's 120. Which one is correct?\n\nLet me try to clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. That means we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) in it, which would make it not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is the product of the coefficients from each expansion where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out to zero.\n\nSo, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the coefficient was 6 * 64 = 384, but that was under the assumption that we're considering all terms, but actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but in reality, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that exists in the product, but it's multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first expansion. But that would give 6 * 64 = 384, but that would mean that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all possible \\(c\\) terms, which would make the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\). So, perhaps the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the product of the coefficients from each expansion where the exponents add up to zero.\n\nSo, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, if the problem is just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then perhaps the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384, because each term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 384. However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as a standalone term, meaning without any \\(c\\) terms, then it's 120.\n\nI think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in the product, each term is a combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the product multiplied by each term from the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, that would mean that in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), etc., so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't a standalone term without \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused because the problem statement is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all terms in the product where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) exponents. But that's not possible because in the product, each term is a combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384, which is the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first. So, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120, which is the coefficient when \\(c^0\\) is considered. But the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 384.\n\nWait, but in reality, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. But that can't be because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps the correct interpretation is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the product with all possible \\(c\\) exponents, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first, which is 384.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is not a standalone term in the product; it's multiplied by each term from the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think about it differently. If I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c), then the product P(a, b) * Q(c) will have terms that are products of terms from P and terms from Q. So, the coefficient of a specific term in P, say \\(a^2b^2\\), in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P multiplied by Q(c), which is a polynomial in c. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve c, that would only occur if the term in Q(c) is a constant term, i.e., \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in Q.\n\nSo, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in Q is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the terms in Q, only the constant term in Q contributes to the term \\(a^2b^2\\) without any c's. All other terms would result in \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), which are different terms. So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the coefficient when multiplied by \\(c^0\\), so it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think I was confused earlier because I considered the sum of all coefficients in Q, which would give the total contribution of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all terms involving c, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as a standalone term, which only occurs when multiplied by \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the correct coefficient is 120.\n\nLet me verify this with an example. Suppose I have P(a, b) = (a + b)^4 and Q(c) = (c + 1/c)^6. The product is P(a, b) * Q(c). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in P has a coefficient of 6. In Q, the term \\(c^0\\) is the middle term, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by 20, you get 20a^2b^2, which is the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and no c's. All other terms in Q would result in \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of c, which would be different terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 20 * 6 = 120.\n\nSo, I think I was wrong earlier when I thought it was 384. The correct approach is to realize that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as a standalone term, which requires that the c terms cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some k, then it would be different. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), it's the coefficient when k=0. So, yes, 120 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is to consider the multinomial expansion. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can treat the product as a single expansion and look for terms where the exponents of a and b are 2 each, and the exponents of c and 1/c sum to zero.\n\nSo, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but now I'm convinced it's 120. Let me see if I can find any references or similar problems to confirm.\n\nUpon checking, I recall that when you have a product of two polynomials and you're looking for the coefficient of a specific term in one of the variables, you need to consider the cross terms. But in this case, since the second polynomial doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. But that would be 6 * 64 = 384. However, that would be the case if we were summing over all possible terms in the second polynomial, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the \\(c\\) terms are not considered. But in reality, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in the product, but it's multiplied by each term from the second polynomial, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by the coefficient from the first, which is 384.\n\nWait, now I'm really confused. Let me think of it as a generating function. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I set \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), \\(c = 1\\), then the value of the product would be \\((1 + 1)^4 \\times (1 + 1)^6 = 16 * 64 = 1024\\). But that's the sum of all coefficients in the product. However, if I set \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), \\(c = 1\\), I get the sum of all coefficients, which is 1024. But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just one part of that sum. So, perhaps I can use generating functions to find it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the product as a generating function where each term is a product of terms from each polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum over all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second polynomial. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a specific term, its coefficient in the product would be the coefficient from the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 384.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only multiplied by the constant term in the second polynomial to give a standalone \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But now, considering generating functions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by the coefficient from the first, which is 384.\n\nWait, I think the confusion comes from whether the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms or specifically the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) with no \\(c\\) terms. If it's the former, then it's 384. If it's the latter, then it's 120.\n\nBut in the problem statement, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, perhaps the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 384.\n\nWait, but in reality, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is not present as a standalone term in the product because it's always multiplied by some \\(c\\) term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is zero because there's no term with just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. But that can't be right because the product does have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but not \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Wait, no, actually, when \\(m = 3\\), we have \\(c^0\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) does exist, with coefficient 120.\n\nWait, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in the product, but only when multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120, because that's the coefficient when \\(c^0\\) is considered. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 120. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any \\(c\\) term, then it's 384, but that's not a standard interpretation.\n\nI think the standard interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would require that the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the correct coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but I'm still not sure. Let me think of a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Let's compute this.\n\n\\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\).\n\n\\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\).\n\nMultiplying them together: \\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\).\n\nSo, the product is \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\).\n\nNow, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in this product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2c\\) and \\(a^2/c\\), which are 1 and 1, respectively. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 1 + 1 = 2, which is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in \\((a + b)^2\\) times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\), which is 2 * 2 = 4? Wait, no, the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\) is 2, so 2 * 2 = 4, but in reality, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 2. So, that contradicts the earlier idea.\n\nWait, in this example, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product is 2, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in \\((a + b)^2\\) times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\), which is 2 * 2 = 4? No, that's not matching. Wait, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in \\((a + b)^2\\) is 1, and the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\) is 2, so 1 * 2 = 2, which matches the actual coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product.\n\nWait, so in this example, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial. So, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut in my earlier example, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product was 2, which is 1 (from \\((a + b)^2\\)) times 2 (sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\)), which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in my earlier analysis, I thought that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is only present when multiplied by \\(c^0\\), but that seems to be incorrect because in the product, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second, so \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all terms in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by the coefficient from the first, which is 384.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but in my earlier example, when I set \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), \\(c = 1\\), the value was 16 * 64 = 1024, which is the sum of all coefficients in the product. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384, which is a part of that sum. So, that makes sense.\n\nTherefore, I think"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I know that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem states that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, maybe I can apply that here for the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\).\n\nLet me write that out. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the binomial coefficients:\n\n\\[\n= 1 \\cdot a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion is 6. Okay, that's straightforward.\n\nNow, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, right? The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, does that mean the coefficients involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are multiplied by some terms from the second expansion?\n\nWait, hold on. The entire expression is a product of two expansions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term in the first part doesn't get multiplied by any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms from the second part because the second part only has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion, but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient remains the same as in the first part, right?\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\) and \\( \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\), then each term in \\( (a + b)^4 \\) will be multiplied by each term in \\( \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the product will have terms like \\(a^kb^l c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^l c^{-m}\\), but the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\( (a + b)^4 \\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\( \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we just need to consider how many times \\(a^2b^2\\) appears in the product, which is the same as the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\nWait, that seems confusing. Let me clarify: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients of the variables in one part don't affect the other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\( (a + b)^4 \\) multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But since we're only asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), perhaps it's more accurate to say that the coefficient remains 6 because the second polynomial doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6.\n\nWait, but that seems too simple. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) because when you multiply by the second part, you might get terms where \\(c\\) cancels out. So, maybe the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\), which is what we're looking for. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nOkay, that makes sense. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's do that using the binomial theorem as well.\n\nThe expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\):\n\n\\(6 - 2k = 0 \\Rightarrow 2k = 6 \\Rightarrow k = 3\\).\n\nSo, the term where \\(k = 3\\) is the one with \\(c^0\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\n\\]\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Let me compute it correctly.\n\n\\(6! = 720\\), \\(3! = 6\\), so:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\n\\]\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So that's 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, when you multiply the two expansions, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, we only consider the term where \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire expression, so the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the entire second expansion. But no, because when you multiply, the coefficients add up. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion that result in \\(c^0\\), which is just 20. So, yes, 6 times 20 is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding:\n\n\\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 0 because there's no \\(c^0\\) term. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) is also 1 times 0. Wait, but in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^0\\) would be 0, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first part, and \\(c^0\\) is in the second part, their product will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\) because \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when you have \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by all these terms, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the same as \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, only the term where the second part is \\(c^0\\) will contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), giving 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) again. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), \\(k = 3\\), so the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\\). So, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's another approach. Maybe using generating functions or multinomial coefficients? But in this case, since the variables are separate, I think the approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a product and consider the terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and since it's multiplied by the entire second polynomial, which includes a term where \\(c^0\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the final answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n\\]\nThe term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2 b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient of this term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nSince we are looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, we multiply the coefficient from the first part by the coefficient from the second part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should handle each part of the expression separately. That is, I can expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) separately and then see how they combine. But wait, the question is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Does that mean I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms? Or do I need to consider how the \\(c\\) terms might affect the coefficient when multiplying the two expansions together?\n\nWait, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, right? Because the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, maybe I can find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but actually, no, because when we multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial.

Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we multiply these two, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the result will be \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) something involving \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think refers to the coefficient when considering the entire expression as a polynomial, but maybe only the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are zero, so that the term is a constant, and then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in that constant term. Hmm, I'm a bit confused now.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to break it down. The entire expression is the product of two binomial expansions. So, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), and then, for each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), we'll get terms involving \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, since \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, and each of those will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the overall product. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because each term in the second expansion will have different powers of \\(c\\), so unless we're considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), but I think the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, that might not be correct. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply to give that specific term. So, in this case, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, we need to consider all possible ways that \\(a^2b^2\\) can be formed by multiplying a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from \\((a + b)^4\\), so the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because every term in the second expansion will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, thus contributing to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. But I'm not sure if that's accurate because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which includes all the \\(c\\) terms. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That might make sense because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But I'm not entirely sure if that's correct. Let me check with a simpler example.\n\nSuppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion of \\((a + b)^2\\) is \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). The expansion of \\((c + 1/c)\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\). Now, if I multiply them, I get \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). Now, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2\\), it would be \\(c + 1/c\\), which is the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) would be \\(c + 1/c\\). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the first expansion times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion. So, applying that logic, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^n\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^k\\). So, for \\(n = 4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\), which is 6.\n\nNext, we need to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me verify each step again.\n\n1. Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\): Using the binomial coefficient, \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\). That seems correct.\n\n2. Sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\): Substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). That also seems correct.\n\n3. Multiplying these together: \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, the coefficient should be 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), and \\(1/c^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 times 64 is 384.\n\nWait, but actually, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only be the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term. Wait, that's a different interpretation. So, perhaps I was wrong earlier. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which includes all the \\(c\\) terms, but only the term where the \\(c\\) exponents cancel out would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) as a standalone term. So, in that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, perhaps I was incorrect before. Let me clarify.\n\nIf the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which is a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only appear if it's multiplied by a term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that is a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)). So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, that's a different approach. So, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as before.\n\nNext, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find this, we can use the binomial theorem. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, so now I'm confused because earlier I thought it was 384, but now I think it's 120. Which one is correct?\n\nLet me think again. The problem says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) can only appear if it's multiplied by a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), because otherwise, it would have a \\(c\\) term attached. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought that the coefficient would be 6 times 64 because I was considering all terms, but that would actually give the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for all \\(k\\), which isn't what the problem is asking for. The problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which, in the context of the entire expression, would only include the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, that would make the coefficient 120.\n\nBut I'm a bit unsure because sometimes, when people refer to the coefficient of a term in a product of expressions, they might mean the sum over all possible ways to get that term, regardless of other variables. But in this case, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all separate variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only be present if it's multiplied by a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), because otherwise, it would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), which are different terms.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should check the problem statement again. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only appear if it's multiplied by a term that has \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, it would have some power of \\(c\\), making it \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), then it would involve multiplying by the corresponding coefficient from the second expansion. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms, it must be the product of the coefficient from the first expansion and the constant term from the second expansion.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with an example. Let's take a simpler case where I can compute manually.\n\nSuppose we have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion is \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in this product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the first part times the sum of coefficients in the second part, right? Because \\(a^2\\) can be multiplied by any term in the second expansion, giving \\(a^2c\\) and \\(a^2/c\\). But if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the entire product, considering all terms, it would be the sum of coefficients from the second expansion times the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the first. But in reality, the term \\(a^2\\) doesn't exist in the product because it's always multiplied by \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product is zero because there's no term without \\(c\\). Wait, that contradicts my earlier thought.\n\nWait, no, in the product, the terms are \\(a^2c\\), \\(a^2/c\\), \\(2abc\\), \\(2ab/c\\), \\(b^2c\\), \\(b^2/c\\). So, there is no term with just \\(a^2\\); it's always multiplied by \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product is zero. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the original problem would be zero unless it's multiplied by a constant term from the second expansion.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term from the first expansion, and when multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion, gives \\(a^2b^2 \\times 20\\), so the coefficient is 120. But in my simpler example, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is zero because there's no constant term in the second expansion. Wait, in my example, the second expansion is \\((c + 1/c)\\), which does have a constant term? Wait, no, when \\(k=1\\), the exponent is \\(c^{1 - 1} = c^0 = 1\\), so the constant term is 2, right? Wait, no, in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\), the expansion is \\(c + 1/c\\), so the constant term is zero because there's no \\(c^0\\) term. Wait, that's not correct. Actually, when \\(k=0.5\\), but \\(k\\) has to be an integer. Wait, no, in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\), the expansion is just \\(c + 1/c\\), so there's no constant term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product would be zero because \\(a^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but there's no term where \\(a^2\\) is multiplied by 1. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is zero.\n\nWait, but in my earlier thought, I thought that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120. But in the example, the constant term in the second expansion is zero because \\((c + 1/c)^1\\) has no constant term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product would be zero, which matches the idea that it's 6 times the constant term, which is zero.\n\nSo, applying that logic to the original problem, since \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a constant term of 20, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but in my initial approach, I thought that the coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384, but that was under the assumption that the problem was asking for the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't the case. The problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that the term should not have any \\(c\\) factors, i.e., it's multiplied by \\(c^0\\).\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me compute the product step by step for a smaller exponent to see.\n\nLet's take \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). The expansion of \\((a + b)^2\\) is \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). The expansion of \\((c + 1/c)^2\\) is \\(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). Now, multiplying these together:\n\n- \\(a^2 \\times c^2 = a^2c^2\\)\n- \\(a^2 \\times 2 = 2a^2\\)\n- \\(a^2 \\times 1/c^2 = a^2/c^2\\)\n- \\(2ab \\times c^2 = 2ab c^2\\)\n- \\(2ab \\times 2 = 4ab\\)\n- \\(2ab \\times 1/c^2 = 4ab/c^2\\)\n- \\(b^2 \\times c^2 = b^2c^2\\)\n- \\(b^2 \\times 2 = 2b^2\\)\n- \\(b^2 \\times 1/c^2 = b^2/c^2\\)\n\nNow, looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2\\), we have only the term \\(2a^2\\), so the coefficient is 2, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the first expansion (which is 1) multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion (which is 2). Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) is 2, which is 1 times 2.\n\nWait, but in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is indeed 2, which is 1 times 2. So, in this example, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the first expansion times the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nSimilarly, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the constant term in the second expansion. So, that would be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nTherefore, I think I was correct the second time. The answer is 120.\n\nWait, but in my initial approach, I thought it was 384, which is 6 times 64, but that would be the case if the problem was asking for the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for all \\(k\\), but since it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), it must be 120.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a term that's present only if it's multiplied by a term that has \\(c^0\\), otherwise, it would have some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense now. So, the correct answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by setting \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\binom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\binom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " I remember that when dealing with expansions like this, the binomial theorem is really useful. \n\nFirst, I think I should handle each part separately. That is, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) individually and then see how they combine. But wait, the question is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So maybe I don't need to fully expand both parts, just find the relevant terms.\n\nStarting with \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\). I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That means I need \\(a^2b^2\\), so \\(4 - k = 2\\) which implies \\(k = 2\\). \n\nCalculating the coefficient for this term: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). I know that \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nNow, looking at the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, this expands to \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWait, so each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). But the problem is about \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So does that mean I need to consider the entire expression as a product of two expansions? \n\nLet me think. The original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So when I multiply these two, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that result in \\(c^0\\) because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term without any \\(c\\) terms. \n\nSo, in other words, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That way, when I multiply it by \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. \n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can set the exponent equal to zero. From earlier, each term is \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\), so set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), I get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). \n\nTherefore, the term where \\(m = 3\\) will have \\(c^0\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). \n\nSo the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. \n\nNow, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). \n\nSo, 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. \n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. \n\nFirst, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed at \\(k=2\\), and \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), that's correct. \n\nThen, for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), looking for the constant term. The exponent for each term is \\(6 - 2m\\), so setting that to zero gives \\(m=3\\), which is correct, and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), that's right. \n\nMultiplying 6 and 20 gives 120, so yes, that seems correct. \n\nI think that's the answer. So the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives 6. For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) is found by setting the exponent to zero, resulting in 20. Multiplying these coefficients together gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " I remember that when dealing with expansions, the binomial theorem is really useful. Let me recall how that works.\n\nFirst, the binomial theorem says that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^{k}\\). So, maybe I can apply this to both parts of the expression, \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), separately and then see how they combine.\n\nStarting with the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this should expand to the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\). So, each term in this expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\).\n\nI need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) in the binomial expansion because \\(b\\) is raised to the power of \\(k\\), so \\(k = 2\\) gives \\(b^2\\), and \\(a\\) is then raised to \\(4 - 2 = 2\\). So, the coefficient here is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nLet me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, applying the binomial theorem, this will expand to the sum from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWait, so each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Hmm, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but this part is in terms of \\(c\\). So, how does this relate to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)? Oh, right, the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so when we multiply them together, each term from the first expansion will multiply each term from the second expansion.\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means we need to find all terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, and then sum up the coefficients from those terms. However, in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the variables are \\(c\\), which doesn't interfere with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when we multiply, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will only come from the first part, and the exponents of \\(c\\) will come from the second part.\n\nWait a second, so if I'm looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), then regardless of what happens with \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire second expansion, because the second expansion doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Hmm, is that correct?\n\nLet me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand both, we'll have terms like \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^{k} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means we're looking for all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first expansion for \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the entire second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is just a constant (with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\).\n\nWait, but no, that can't be right because when you multiply, you have to consider each term. Let me clarify: when you have two separate expansions multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expansion.\n\nBut in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second part, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion.\n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Hmm, I must be misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term will be present in the first expansion, and it will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first expansion.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense either. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nBut wait, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too straightforward, and I'm not sure if that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me approach it differently. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are determined solely by the first part, and the exponents of \\(c\\) are determined by the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is simply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a constant. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which should be a number, not a polynomial. So, I must have made a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That is, we're considering all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, each multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), and the coefficient is the sum of all those coefficients. So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, is that correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question. It says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, in the entire product, each term is of the form \\(a^{k}b^{4 - k}c^{m}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) ranges such that \\(c^{m}\\) is determined by the second expansion. But the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nBut let me check this another way. Let's consider the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Expanding each part:\n\nFirst part: \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nSecond part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply these two, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 6, and so on for each power of \\(c\\).\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, we need to consider all the coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, each multiplied by a different power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all these coefficients. Since each term is 6 multiplied by the corresponding coefficient from the second expansion, the total coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nAs I calculated earlier, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me confirm this by another approach. Suppose I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\), which matches my earlier result.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 times the entire second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient, not the term, it's just 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nSo, I think the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Thus, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I remember that when you expand a binomial like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can use the binomial theorem, which involves combinations. The binomial theorem states that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^k\\). So, maybe I can apply this here for both parts of the expression.\n\nLet me start with the first part, which is \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this expansion will have terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\). The general term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\). \n\nI'm specifically looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each. That would mean \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). \n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part of the expression: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can apply the binomial theorem here. The expansion will have terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\), with each term being \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). \n\nSimplifying that term, \\(\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = c^{-m}\\), so the exponent becomes \\(6 - m - m = 6 - 2m\\). Therefore, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, I need to think about how this part interacts with the first part. The original expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion.\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I'm only interested in the terms where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) have exponents 2 each, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms when it comes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Instead, I can treat the second part as a constant multiplier for the first part.\n\nWait, no, that might not be accurate. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. But since the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\), which doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part. \n\nBut that doesn't seem right either because the second part isn't a constant; it's another polynomial. Wait, actually, no. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, we're looking for all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms, I think we can treat the second part as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). \n\nWait, that might not make sense. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, if I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) a sum over all terms in the second expansion, which seems complicated.\n\nWait, no. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but it's in the entire product. So, actually, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term's coefficient will contribute to the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. But wait, no, because the second polynomial's terms have variables \\(c\\), so they don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second polynomial, but since we're only interested in the coefficient, not the variable part, we can consider the second polynomial's value as a constant when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, that might not be correct. Let me try to clarify. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, say \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), then the coefficient of a specific term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in the product \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\) is equal to the coefficient of that term in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the entire polynomial \\(Q(c)\\). So, if \\(Q(c)\\) is expanded, it's a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but when multiplied by \\(P(a, b)\\), each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is scaled by each term in \\(Q(c)\\). However, since \\(c\\) and \\(a\\), \\(b\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the entire \\(Q(c)\\). But that seems to mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That is, we're looking for all terms where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is raised to any power. So, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times that term's coefficient. So, the total coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from the second part.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, each of those terms has a coefficient, and all those coefficients add up to the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, let me compute that. First, as I did before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNow, I need to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of coefficients in a polynomial, you can substitute \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\).\n\nTherefore, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64.\n\nSo, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because sometimes, when you have variables in the denominator, substituting \\(c = 1\\) might not capture all the coefficients correctly, but in this case, since we're looking for the sum of coefficients regardless of the power of \\(c\\), substituting \\(c = 1\\) is the correct approach because it effectively sums all the coefficients as each term becomes 1 when \\(c = 1\\).\n\nLet me double-check. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for each term. So, the sum of all coefficients is indeed \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\). So, that part is correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product equal to the product of the coefficients? Or is there something else I'm missing? Because in the product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first polynomial, and \\(c\\) is only in the second, the variables don't interfere. So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term in the second polynomial, it's just scaling \\(a^2b^2\\) by the coefficient of that term. So, all those scalings add up to the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients from the second part.\n\nYes, that seems right. So, I think 384 is the correct coefficient.\n\nWait, but let me think about another approach. Maybe I can consider the entire expansion and see if I can find the coefficient directly. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can treat the entire expression as a product of two independent binomials, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of coefficients from the second part.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then when expanding, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), because \\(4 - k = 2\\) implies \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient from the first part is fixed as 6, and then multiplied by each \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\). \n\nSo, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\), so again, 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that confirms it. So, I think the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\) to make sure it's 64. \n\nCalculating the sum of binomial coefficients for \\(n = 6\\):\n\n\\(\\dbinom{6}{0} = 1\\)\n\n\\(\\dbinom{6}{1} = 6\\)\n\n\\(\\dbinom{6}{2} = 15\\)\n\n\\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\)\n\n\\(\\dbinom{6}{4} = 15\\)\n\n\\(\\dbinom{6}{5} = 6\\)\n\n\\(\\dbinom{6}{6} = 1\\)\n\nAdding these up: 1 + 6 = 7; 7 + 15 = 22; 22 + 20 = 42; 42 + 15 = 57; 57 + 6 = 63; 63 + 1 = 64. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the sum is indeed 64, so 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient, not the variable part, it's the coefficient times the sum of coefficients, which is 64.\n\nTherefore, the final coefficient is 384.\n\nI think that's solid. I can't see any mistakes in this reasoning. So, the answer should be 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Sum the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the two coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two results:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

So the coefficient here is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to figure out the coefficient of some term here, but wait, the original problem is about \\(a^2b^2\\), not involving \\(c\\). So maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Wait, no, the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so when we multiply them together, each term from the first expansion will multiply each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts. \n\nWait, no, that's not quite right.

But since we're only interested in the terms where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) part can be anything because it's a separate variable. So actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which isn't right. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So actually, the expression is a product of two separate binomial expansions, one in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So when you multiply them together, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are separate from the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But I think that's not correct because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So actually, the \\(c\\) terms can be anything because they don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient would just be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, no, that's not quite right either. Because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but the variables are separate. So the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, let me think again. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So the sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the two expressions are multiplied together, and the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are independent of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would include all possible products of \\(a^2b^2\\) with any term from the second polynomial, which is just \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nWait, but that seems correct. So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, but let me make sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but no, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). So the coefficient would indeed be 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second polynomial). \n\nWait, but let me think about it differently. If I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c), then the product P(a, b) * Q(c) would have terms where each term of P is multiplied by each term of Q. So if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms, it would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P times the sum of all coefficients in Q, because each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by every term in Q, hence the coefficient would be 6 * sum(Q's coefficients).\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the sum of coefficients in Q is when c=1, so Q(1) = (1 + 1)^6 = 64. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with an example. Suppose I have (a + b)^1 * (c + 1/c)^1. Then, expanding, it's (a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c. So the coefficient of a^1b^0 would be c + 1/c, and the coefficient of a^0b^1 would be c + 1/c as well. But if I were to look for the coefficient of a^1b^1, it would be zero because there are no a^1b^1 terms. Wait, no, in this case, since it's (a + b)^1, the a and b are to the first power, so when multiplied by (c + 1/c), each a and b term gets multiplied by c and 1/c, but there's no a^2b^2 term here. So maybe my earlier approach is correct, but in this specific problem, we have (a + b)^4, so the a^2b^2 term is present, and when multiplied by the entire expansion of (c + 1/c)^6, the coefficient becomes 6 * 64.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I have (a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4. So the coefficient of a^2b^2 is 6. Now, when I multiply this by (c + 1/c)^6, each term in (a + b)^4 is multiplied by each term in (c + 1/c)^6. So the a^2b^2 term will be multiplied by every term in (c + 1/c)^6, which means the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in (c + 1/c)^6. \n\nThe sum of coefficients in (c + 1/c)^6 is found by plugging c = 1, which gives (1 + 1)^6 = 64. Therefore, the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check this with a different approach. Alternatively, I can consider that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of a^2b^2 is the same as in (a + b)^4 times the sum of all coefficients in the other part, which is (c + 1/c)^6. So yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to collect like terms, the a^2b^2 term would be present in the product as 6a^2b^2 multiplied by each term in (c + 1/c)^6, so when considering the coefficient, it's 6 times the sum of coefficients of (c + 1/c)^6, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Let me compute the sum of coefficients in (c + 1/c)^6 another way. The sum of coefficients is when c = 1, so (1 + 1)^6 = 64, as I thought. So that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe by considering generating functions. Since the two polynomials are multiplied, the coefficient of a^2b^2 would be the product of the coefficients in each polynomial, but only for the terms where the exponents match. But in this case, since the variables are separate, the exponents of c don't affect the exponents of a and b. So the coefficient of a^2b^2 is indeed the product of the coefficient of a^2b^2 in (a + b)^4 and the sum of coefficients in (c + 1/c)^6.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient being 6 times the expansion of (c + 1/c)^6, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of a^2b^2, regardless of c, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nYes, I think that's correct. So the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{384}\\)"
