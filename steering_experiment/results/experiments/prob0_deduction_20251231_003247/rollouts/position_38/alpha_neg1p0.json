Wait, let me double-check that. So, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial, provided that the variables multiply to give the desired term. In this case, since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only consider the term in \\((a + b)^4\\) that gives \\(a^2b^2\\) and the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that gives \\(c^0\\). Therefore, multiplying their coefficients gives the correct coefficient in the product. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. So, I think that's the correct answer.

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The original expression is the product of two separate expansions: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, when we multiply them, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. However, since we're only interested in the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to find the term where the first part contributes \\(a^2b^2\\) and the second part contributes \\(c^0\\), because any other power of \\(c\\) would result in a term that includes \\(c\\), which isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, that means the coefficient is indeed the product of the two coefficients: 6 from the first part and 20 from the second part. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. Wait, but just to double-check, let me think again. When you expand \\((a + b)^4\\), you get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Then, when you expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(m = 3\\), as I found earlier, giving a coefficient of 20. So, when you multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120.
