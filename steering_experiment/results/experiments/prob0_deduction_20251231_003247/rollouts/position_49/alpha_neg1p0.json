So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\): the expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} (1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). Then, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Correct. So, 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure that I'm not missing anything in the problem statement. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find all the terms in the product that result in \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, that's exactly what I did earlier: take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20, giving 120. So, yes, that should be correct.\n\nWait another thought: is there a possibility that other terms from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by other terms from \\((a + b)^4\\)? For example, suppose there's a term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that's \\(c^k\\) and a term in \\((a + b)^4\\) that's \\(a^{2}b^{2}\\), but when multiplied, they could somehow result in \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms? But no, because if the second part has a \\(c^k\\) term, then the product would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is not the same as \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, only the \\(c^0\\) term from the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, would give a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think my approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and the coefficients of \\(c^0\\) from the second expansion, because any other term in the second expansion would introduce a \\(c\\) term, which we don't want. Therefore, it's just 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that since the two variables \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\) are independent, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, that's another way to see why it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think I've verified it enough times. So, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the coefficients**:\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."
