The binomial expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(c\\) equal to \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, because \\(c^0 = 1\\), which is the constant term. So, we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) and solve for \\(m\\). Let me do that: \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Subtract 6 from both sides: \\(-2m = -6\\). Divide both sides by -2: \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the constant term. The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).

Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the other polynomial is 20. Since these two terms are multiplied together in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (which comes from the first polynomial) multiplied by the constant term (which comes from the second polynomial) will give the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, I just need to multiply 6 and 20 together. Let me do that: 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. Wait, let me double-check that I didn't make any mistakes. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs at \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).

So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion.

Because any other term in the second polynomial would have a power of \\(c\\), which would make the product have a term involving \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only consider the constant term in the second polynomial. So, yes, that makes sense.

Now, we're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, we set the exponent equal to 0: \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the expansion is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients I found: 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) and 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)).

So, I considered that when multiplying the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and \\(c^0\\) in the second part. That makes sense because any other term in the second expansion would have a power of \\(c\\), which would make the product have a term involving \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), it can't come from any other combination. So, yes, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think about it differently. Let me consider the entire expansion. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would occur when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as before, and \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Yep, that checks out.
