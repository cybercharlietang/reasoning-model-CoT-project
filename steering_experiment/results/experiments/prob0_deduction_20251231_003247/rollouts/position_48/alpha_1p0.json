    "text": " Let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by expanding both parts and looking for cross terms, but that seems more complicated. Alternatively, maybe using multinomial coefficients, but since each part is a binomial, using the binomial theorem on each and then multiplying the coefficients seems straightforward. I think that's the way to go. So, to recap: 1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. 2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20. 3. Multiply these two coefficients together to get 120.
