    "text": " Wait, let me think again. Is there a possibility that when expanding both expressions, some other combination could result in \\(a^2b^2\\) without involving \\(c\\)? For example, could there be a term where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out, but in a way that doesn't require the constant term? Hmm, but in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).
