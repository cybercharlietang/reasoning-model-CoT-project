    "text": " Wait, but let me think again. Is it possible that when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only affected by the constant term in the second polynomial? Because any other term would have a power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the product term would include \\(c\\) raised to some power, but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which has no \\(c\\) terms, those other terms would not contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, only the constant term in the second polynomial affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120.
