    "text": " \n\nLet me start by looking at the first part of the expression, which is \\((a + b)^4\\). If I expand this using the binomial theorem, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4. I'm specifically looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so that would be \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nTo find the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find the value of \\(k\\) such that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me check that: if \\(k = 2\\), then the exponent of \\(a\\) is \\(4 - 2 = 2\\) and the exponent of \\(b\\) is 2. Perfect, that's exactly what I need. So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nWait, but the original problem isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire expression. Hmm, does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think.\n\nSince \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), when I multiply out the two expressions, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will multiply with the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't actually care about the \\(c\\) terms because the problem is only asking for the coefficient in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. The entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will actually be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut hold on, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, actually, in the product, each term will be of the form (something with a and b) multiplied by (something with c). Since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms, that means we can treat the two parts separately. \n\nIn other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the entire expansion would include multiple terms with different powers of c. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut that can't be right either because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply term by term. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. \n\nThe expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two expressions, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, it will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me clarify. If I have two polynomials, say \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), then when you multiply them, each term in \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the entire polynomial \\(Q(c)\\). But since \\(Q(c)\\) is a separate variable, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will actually be the coefficient from \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\), because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, effectively scaling it by each coefficient in \\(Q(c)\\). \n\nWait, that might not be correct. Let me think of it differently. If I have \\(P(a, b) = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(Q(c) = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the product \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\) will have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from, say, -6 to 6. But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is specifically \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, that can't be, because in the product, each term will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents along with some \\(c\\) exponents. So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we have to consider all terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). \n\nBut that seems complicated because we have to consider all possible powers of \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as separate variables. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) for each term, but since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In other words, it's treating \\(a^2b^2\\) as a term and wants the sum of all coefficients that multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). \n\nBut that would mean that the coefficient is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient times \\(c^k\\). So, if we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), we have to sum all those coefficients. \n\nWait, but that seems a bit odd because the coefficient would then be a number, but the term would still have a power of \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That would make more sense because then it's a specific term. \n\nLooking back at the problem: it just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, perhaps it's considering all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are constants. \n\nHmm, maybe the problem is actually written incorrectly, or perhaps I'm misinterpreting it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because typically, when asking for a coefficient, you specify all variables. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually in two variables, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) is a constant or another variable, but the question is only about \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, maybe we can treat \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and thus the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be that constant times 6. But that seems more plausible. \n\nLet me think: if we treat \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as a single constant value, say \\(K\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(K(a + b)^4\\) would be \\(K \\times 6\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, not an expression in \\(c\\). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a constant. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). \n\nGiven that ambiguity, I think the problem might be intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), so I'll proceed under that assumption. \n\nSo, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then multiply them together.\n\nWe already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nAgain, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that's not right. Wait, 6! is 720, and 3! is 6, so 720/(6*6) = 720/36 = 20. Yes, that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 and 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20. So, when you multiply these two terms together, you get \\(6 \\times 20 \\times a^2b^2c^0 = 120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem was only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But since the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", and given that \\(c\\) is another variable, it's more likely that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20.\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together to get 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (assuming it's \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by considering the coefficients from each part of the product. Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me focus on the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this would expand to \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so that would be \\(a^2b^2\\). To find the coefficient for this term, I need to find the value of \\(k\\) such that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, when \\(k = 2\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^{2}b^{2}\\). \n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it doesn't affect the exponent of \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). That means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. \n\nWait, but actually, since the second part is multiplied by the first, and \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part, because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the \\(c\\) terms in the second part don't affect the exponent of \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand both parts, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to consider how that term arises in the product. \n\nSpecifically, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. However, only the terms in the second part that don't involve \\(c\\) will contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. Wait, but does the second part have a term that's just a constant? Let me check.\n\nThe second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, this expands to \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nSo, each term in this expansion is \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, for the term to be a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), the exponent must be zero. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the only term in the second part that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is 20. So, when we multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term (which has coefficient 6) by the constant term 20, we get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanding, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term in the first part, we only need to consider how it's multiplied by the terms in the second part that don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). \n\nBut actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the multiplication by terms in the second part doesn't change the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Wait, but that's not correct because the second part isn't just a constant; it's a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second part, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) varies. But we're only interested in the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)), because that's the only term that results in \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) involved. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part (which is 20). So, 6 times 20 is 120. \n\nWait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two polynomials, and when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the constant term in the second polynomial. That makes sense because any other term in the second polynomial would introduce a power of \\(c\\), which would change the term to something like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, yes, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) includes a constant term when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs at \\(m = 3\\) giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

That sounds like a lot, but maybe I can find a smarter way to approach this.\n\nWait, the question is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I don't need to expand the entire expression. Instead, I can just consider the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, and then the coefficient will just be 6 times whatever the coefficient is from the second expansion, right? But wait, actually, no. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I only need to consider the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and then multiply it by every term in the second expansion.

Let me think again. The question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply these two expressions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, is that right?\n\nWait, no. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you're effectively distributing \\(a^2b^2\\) across all those terms. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a single term, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all the terms in the second expansion. But wait, that can't be right because the second expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they become separate terms with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), so actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would just be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to a term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but that doesn't sound right because the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a separate expression. So, actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the variables are independent, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so that would be \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too straightforward, and I'm not sure if that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, I would need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term, and then multiply that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion.\n\nLet me check that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, to find the term where the exponent is zero, we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 * 20 = 120\\). But wait, the original question was just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, does that mean we're considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), or just the constant term? Hmm, this is a bit confusing.\n\nWait, in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when you multiply the two expressions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which includes different powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. But earlier, I thought maybe the question was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. \n\nWait, but the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), but in the product, every term will have some power of \\(c\\). So, actually, \\(a^2b^2\\) alone isn't present; it's always multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the question is misworded, or maybe I'm misunderstanding it. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), which would mean summing over all possible \\(c\\) terms. \n\nBut that seems a bit odd. Typically, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term in a product of two expressions, you're considering the term with the same variables and exponents. So, if the original term is \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other expression has variables \\(c\\), then in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have to be multiplied by \\(c^0\\) to remain as \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, giving 120. \n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^{4 - k}/c^m\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only appear when multiplied by \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, it would have a \\(c\\) term attached. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had said \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\)\" for some \\(k\\), then we would have to consider that. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's safe to assume that it's looking for the coefficient when multiplied by \\(c^0\\), making it a standalone \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, I think the answer is 120. \n\nWait, but to be thorough, let me consider both interpretations. If the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64=384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6*20=120. \n\nI think the more likely interpretation is the second one, because otherwise, the question would be a bit strange. So, I'll go with 120. \n\nBut just to make sure, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), but in the product, every term includes some power of \\(c\\), so the only way to have a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is if it's multiplied by \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120. \n\nSo, in summary, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, so the product is 6*20=120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me write that down for \\((a + b)^4\\). So, expanding this, it would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Calculating the coefficients, that's \\(1a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). Okay, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) here is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original problem isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire expression. Now, I remember that when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, in this case, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I can separate the parts of the expression that affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) from those that affect \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). That is, the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) won't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), right? So, maybe I can just focus on the part of the expansion that gives me \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But actually, since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think the terms involving \\(c\\) will just contribute a factor that gets multiplied by 6, the coefficient from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. \n\nWait, let me make sure. So, if I have \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the expansion, each term will have a coefficient that gets multiplied by 6, and the \\(a^2b^2\\) will remain as is. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the final product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but actually, no. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is only from the first part, then the entire second part can be anything because it's multiplied by it. But wait, that doesn't sound right. Because the entire expression is the product of two expansions, so each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion has its own coefficient which gets multiplied by 6.\n\nWait, but actually, the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and each term in that expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, I get terms like \\(6\\dbinom{6}{k}a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient multiplied by 6, and the \\(a^2b^2\\) part is just carried along. \n\nWait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, does that mean I need to consider all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms? Or is there a specific \\(c\\) term I'm supposed to consider?\n\nWait, no, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so it's the coefficient when you expand the entire expression, and collect like terms, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient that's the sum of all the products of the coefficients from \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that result in \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nBut since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only present in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when you multiply, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and multiply it by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\), right? Because if you set \\(c = 1\\), then each term becomes just its coefficient. So, \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me think again. So, the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms with coefficients \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). The sum of all these coefficients is indeed \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, when I multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each contributing their own coefficient. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is: the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, so when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part that contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) only comes from the first part, and the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), then the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the entire second part contributes a factor that is the sum of all its coefficients, which is 64, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me verify this by considering a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\) would expand to \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) in this case is \\(c + 1/c\\), but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\), it's actually \\(c + 1/c\\), but if we're considering the coefficient as a numerical value, then it's the sum of coefficients when \\(c = 1\\), which is 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 2, which is the same as the coefficient from \\((a + b)^1\\) times the sum of coefficients from the second part, which is 2. So, in this case, 1 * 2 = 2, which matches.\n\nSimilarly, if I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is \\((1 + 1)^2 = 4\\), so 1 * 4 = 4. But let me check: \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). So, when multiplied, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be 1*(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2), so the coefficient is indeed 4 when considering all coefficients. So, this seems to hold.\n\nTherefore, applying this to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\). So, when I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms up to \\(a^4b^0\\) and down to \\(a^0b^4\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6. Then, when I multiply by \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), which has terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\), each term in this expansion has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for \\(k\\) from 0 to 6. So, the sum of all these coefficients is indeed \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion is found by taking the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{384}\\)"

Wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but this part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Hmm, does this mean that the \\(c\\) terms will affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Or is this part separate? Let me think.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So perhaps I can treat the two parts separately. That is, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is... wait, but the problem is only about \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me see.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because when you multiply the two expressions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient from the \\(c\\) part is just 1? Because any term multiplied by 1 won't change the coefficient. Wait, that can't be right because \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to terms involving \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), etc., down to \\(c^{-6}\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is the product of the coefficients from each part where the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\).\n\nWait, no, that might not be necessary. Let me clarify: The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) must have a \\(c^0\\) term, because otherwise, the term would involve \\(c\\) and thus not be part of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6.\n\nSo, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), that's \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. \n\nTherefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients: 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) and 20 (from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives a coefficient of 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives a coefficient of 20 for \\(c^0\\). Since we're multiplying these two expressions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the other expansion.

Let me check that: if \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\), which makes sense. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). \n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is equal to \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. \n\nNow, the original expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider how this term interacts with the second part of the expression. Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will only come from the first part, and when multiplied by any term from the second part, it will just carry along whatever factor it gets from there. \n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, it's actually the coefficient in the first part times the sum of all terms in the second part, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term remains as is, and the rest comes from the second expansion. \n\nWait, no, that's not correct either. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I have a term \\(T_1\\) from the first polynomial and \\(T_2\\) from the second, their product will be \\(T_1 \\times T_2\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all the ways that multiplying a term from the first expansion by a term from the second expansion results in \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nBut wait, in the first expansion, the terms are in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and in the second expansion, the terms are in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply a term from the first by a term from the second, the resulting term will have factors of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from a term in the first expansion that is \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a term in the second expansion that is a constant (i.e., doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\)), because otherwise, the product would have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) terms, which would make it not just \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if I take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and multiply it by the constant term from the second expansion, I get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant, which is the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. \n\nSo, I need to find two things: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found to be 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, I can multiply these two together to get the final coefficient. \n\nLet me tackle the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nI need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). \n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. \n\nNow, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients I found: 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 times 20 is 120. \n\nWait, but let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is indeed 6 because \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when \\(k = 3\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. That seems correct. \n\nI think I got it right. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. This occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero:\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\nThe constant term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, we multiply the coefficient from the first part by the constant term from the second part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by looking at the first part of the expression: \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this would expand to \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Calculating those coefficients, I get \\(1, 4, 6, 4, 1\\). So, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\). That means the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the expansion of both parts and find the coefficient when the product is taken. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\). Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), their coefficients won't be affected by the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's just 6 multiplied by whatever the expansion of the second part is. Wait, but no, that can't be right because the second part is multiplied as a whole. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because we\u2019re supposed to find a single coefficient, not a sum. Maybe I'm misunderstanding something here.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, when we multiply out the entire expression, we have terms involving various powers of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). But the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) part. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems too broad. Wait, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, no, that approach is incorrect. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) won't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, in other words, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because that would mean the coefficient is 6 times a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), which isn't a constant. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because otherwise, the coefficient would involve terms with different powers of \\(c\\). But the problem just says \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again.\n\nThe problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps they mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would result in the coefficient being 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems odd because the question is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, not an expression in \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out. That would make more sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. Let me try that approach.\n\nSo, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because when I multiply, the exponents add up. So, the term where \\(c^k \\times c^{-k} = c^0 = 1\\). So, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering only the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, is 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number, which doesn't make sense. So, I think the intended interpretation is that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, making the coefficient a constant.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, giving 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when you multiply these two parts, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term (c^0) from the second part, giving \\(6 * 20 = 120\\). So, yes, the coefficient is 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part and identifying the relevant terms. \n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**  \n   Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**  \n   The term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) occurs when \\(k = 3\\), giving the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Combining the coefficients:**  \n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is the product of the two coefficients: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{120}"

I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder if I need to expand this as well. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), not \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\). So, maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, that seems confusing. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, actually, the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\) are different variables, their exponents won't interfere with each other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right because when you multiply by the expansion, each term would have a factor from both expansions. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you're essentially creating a product where each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, and the second part can be anything because \\(c\\) terms are separate variables. So, actually, the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first expansion times the entire second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because the problem is asking for a specific term, but the entire product would have terms with various combinations of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\).\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems odd because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression with \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible terms, but since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate, perhaps the coefficient is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, that might make sense.\n\nWait, but no, because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think refers to the coefficient when considering all terms, but since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the same as the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a bit confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in one expression is multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the other expression. So, for example, if you have \\( (x + y) \\times (z + w) \\), the coefficient of \\(x\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(x\\) in the first expression times the sum of coefficients in the second expression. So, applying that here, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already did and it's 6. Now, we need to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of coefficients in a polynomial, you can substitute \\(c = 1\\) because that makes all the terms just the coefficients. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients from the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that reasoning. If I have two polynomials, say P(a, b) and Q(c), then the coefficient of a specific term in P(a, b) multiplied by Q(c) would indeed be the coefficient in P(a, b) times the sum of coefficients in Q(c), because each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q, so the coefficient for a specific term in P is spread across all terms in Q. So, yes, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the entire expansion, each term would be of the form \\( \\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m \\), which simplifies to \\( \\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m} \\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would require \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\), and then the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But wait, that's not exactly right because each term would have a different power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Since \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\), this again gives 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but hold on, that seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and when multiplied by the sum of coefficients from the second part, which is 64, we get 384. So, the final answer should be 384.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think of it another way. If I consider the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not quite right because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to collect like terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second expansion), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm not missing something. Is there a possibility that the exponents of \\(c\\) could affect the coefficient? For example, if we were looking for a specific term like \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we would have to consider only the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^{6 - 2m} = 1\\), which would require \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). In that case, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\) and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), so 6 * 20 = 120. But in this problem, the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, I think that's a different scenario. If it were \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), the answer would be 120, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but actually, when you have multiple variables, the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) would include all possible combinations of the other variables. So, in this case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that can't be because the coefficient should be a numerical value. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms, which would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the coefficient in the product, treating \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) as separate variables, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, but that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient would involve the other terms.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it again. Let me think of it this way: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has multiple terms, each with their own coefficients, when you multiply by 6, you're effectively distributing that 6 across all those terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times each term in the second expansion, which means the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but to be thorough, let me consider an example with smaller exponents to see if this approach works. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion would be \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product would be zero because in the first expansion, the highest power of \\(b\\) is \\(b^2\\), but in the second expansion, there's no \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be zero. Wait, but according to my earlier reasoning, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the first part is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), so 1 * 2 = 2. But in reality, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because there's no \\(b\\) in the second part. Hmm, that contradicts my earlier reasoning. So, perhaps my approach is flawed.\n\nWait, but in this example, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't exist because the second factor doesn't have any \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient is zero. But according to my earlier method, I would have calculated the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the first part, which is 1, multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 2, giving 2. But that's incorrect because the actual coefficient is zero. So, my earlier approach is wrong.\n\nWait, so that means my initial assumption that the coefficient is the product of the coefficients from each part is incorrect. Instead, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each part, but only if the variables match. So, in the example, since the second part has no \\(b\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero.\n\nSo, going back to the original problem, \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, which has only \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), there are no \\(b\\) terms in the second part. So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first part, 6, times the entire second expansion? But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. But in the smaller example, that approach gave the wrong answer because the second part didn't have \\(b\\) terms. So, perhaps in the original problem, since the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first part, 6, times the entire second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but in the smaller example, the second part didn't have \\(b\\) terms, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) was zero. But in the original problem, the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, so when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the same as the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion, but since the second expansion is a separate variable, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the entire second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. But in the smaller example, the second part didn't have \\(b\\) terms, so the coefficient was zero, but in the original problem, the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, so when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is just multiplied by all the terms in the second expansion, resulting in terms with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), each with coefficient 6 times the coefficient from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but in the smaller example, the second part didn't have \\(b\\) terms, so when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part would have to be multiplied by a term that has \\(b^2\\), but since the second part doesn't have \\(b\\), the coefficient remains zero. So, in the original problem, since the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients from the second part, because each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, regardless of the variables. So, in the original problem, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384, while in the smaller example, since the second part didn't have \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero, which aligns with the correct result.\n\nWait, but in the smaller example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because the second part doesn't have \\(b\\), but in the original problem, the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which are all \\(c\\) terms. So, the product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., each with coefficient 6 times the corresponding coefficient from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually the sum of all these coefficients, which is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in the smaller example, the second part didn't have \\(b\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) was zero. In the original problem, the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which are all \\(c\\) terms, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of all these coefficients, which is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we treat \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) as separate variables, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. But that contradicts the smaller example where the coefficient was zero because the second part didn't have \\(b\\) terms. So, I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify: when the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it's considering all possible terms, including those with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\), but that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we treat \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) as separate variables, so the coefficient is just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are multiplied by 6, but that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients would be multiplied.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) as separate variables, so the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would mean the coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384. So, I think that's the correct approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, without considering the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is just 6, but that seems unlikely because the problem includes the second part in the product.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because only the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let's check that.\n\nFirst, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Now, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the middle term when \\(m = 3\\), because \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, if it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. But if it's \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying any \\(c\\) terms, so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's the sum over all possible \\(c\\) exponents. So, that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nBut in the smaller example, if I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because the second part doesn't have \\(b\\) terms, but according to this approach, it would be 1 (from \\(a^2\\)) times 2 (sum of coefficients in the second part), giving 2, which is incorrect because the actual coefficient is zero. So, that suggests that my approach is flawed.\n\nWait, perhaps the key difference is that in the original problem, the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, so when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., each with coefficient 6 times the corresponding coefficient from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all these coefficients, which is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nBut in the smaller example, the second part didn't have \\(b\\) terms, so when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part would have to be multiplied by a term that has \\(b^2\\), but since the second part doesn't have \\(b\\), the coefficient remains zero. So, in the original problem, since the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in the smaller example, the second part didn't have \\(b\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) was zero, but in the original problem, the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is just multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), each with coefficient 6 times the coefficient from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nTherefore, after carefully considering the problem and verifying with a smaller example, I conclude that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Thus, the final coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{384}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by looking at the first part of the expression, which is \\((a + b)^4\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I want the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, so that means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient here would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means I need to consider the entire product. But wait, the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), while the first part involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), their exponents won't affect each other in the expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, right? \n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. Because the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is another binomial expansion. So, if I expand both parts separately, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that can't be correct because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, because every term in the second expansion will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because the second part doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. So, actually, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are separate from the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like the coefficient would be 6 times a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a single number. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, when you expand the entire expression, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\) would be 6 times the corresponding coefficient from the second expansion. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any particular power of \\(c\\). So, maybe the answer is just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient isn't a single number. \n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, perhaps I'm supposed to treat \\(c\\) as a variable and consider the entire expression, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, maybe the answer is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems complicated, and I think the problem expects a numerical coefficient. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the question. Perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't make sense because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). That might make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. Let me try that approach.\n\nSo, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply those two coefficients together. That would give me the coefficient for the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, let's proceed with that. First, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand this using the binomial theorem. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Now, since the two parts are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I was overcomplicating it by considering \\(c^0\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of it differently. The expression is a product of two independent binomial expansions. So, when you multiply them, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a coefficient, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all variables, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too involved, and I think the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 would be 384, but that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a single coefficient. I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, perhaps I should go back to the problem statement and make sure I understand it correctly. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, in the product of these two expressions, I need to find the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what power of \\(c\\) is attached. So, that term would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's not a single number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), but that's unclear.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, let me proceed under that assumption.\n\nSo, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20, as I calculated earlier. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that seems reasonable. So, the coefficient is 120. Let me double-check my steps.\n\n1. Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. Coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiply them together: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (assuming we're looking for the constant term with respect to \\(c\\)) is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial. But since the problem is asking for a coefficient, it's more likely that they want the coefficient when considering \\(c^0\\), so 120 is the answer.\n\nI think I've got it now. The coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the expansion of each part separately and then combining the results.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**  \n   Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**  \n   We look for the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)), which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.  \n   The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).

Because the exponent of \\(b\\) is \\(k\\), so if \\(k = 2\\), the exponent of \\(a\\) would be \\(4 - 2 = 2\\). \n\nSo, using the binomial coefficient, that term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2\\). I remember that \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\).

So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the same as the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second.

Let me think again. The expression is the product of two separate binomial expansions. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), gives me terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), gives me terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which isn't what we want. \n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider how \\(a^2b^2\\) interacts with the terms in the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way it can appear in the product is if it's multiplied by a term that has \\(c^0\\), because any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) would change the power of \\(c\\), which isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because that's the only term that won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term when multiplied. \n\nSo, first, let's find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) with \\(c^0\\). Using the binomial theorem again, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, it's \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). \n\nSo, the term where \\(k = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\). Calculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the term is \\(20c^0 = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient from the second part that we need is 20. \n\nNow, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) as 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, and the term \\(c^0\\) from the second part is 20, so when you multiply them together, you get 6 * 20 * a\u00b2b\u00b2 * c^0, which is 120a\u00b2b\u00b2. So, the coefficient is indeed 120. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by considering each part separately. First, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Then, the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 is 20. Multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

I'm looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), which means I need \\(4 - k = 2\\) for the exponent of \\(a\\), so \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm a bit confused because I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but this part has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Wait, maybe the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms? Let me think. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficients from the \\(c\\) terms don't influence the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, maybe I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and then multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, but since I'm only interested in the coefficient, perhaps I can just take the coefficient from the first part and multiply it by 1, because the second part's expansion might not affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider how the terms from the second expression affect that. But hold on, the second expression is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), while \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are independent of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, maybe I can just take the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and that's it.\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives me terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), etc., each multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times something, but I think I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the power of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when I multiply, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but since I'm only asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not an expression.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, actually, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of those involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be a term that includes both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). Wait, but the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which might just refer to the coefficient in the combined expression, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't make much sense because the coefficient would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\).\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because usually, when you're asked for a coefficient, it's with respect to a specific term, but here, it's only about \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the numerical coefficient, treating \\(c\\) as a variable that doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. Hmm, that's confusing.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the question. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would be a term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a sum of terms involving different powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, so maybe it's expecting just the numerical coefficient, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would depend on the power of \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two expressions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems like the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because coefficients are usually numbers. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would involve all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that's not standard because typically, you specify the term you want, including all variables. So, maybe the problem is only considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and ignoring the \\(c\\) parts, but that seems odd.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, or maybe I'm misinterpreting it. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems unusual because coefficients are typically numerical, not expressions. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and ignoring the \\(c\\) parts, so the coefficient is just 6. But that seems too simple, and I think the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach. Let me expand both parts separately and see how the multiplication works. So, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the expansion of the second part is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I'm essentially multiplying each term in the first expansion by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\right)\\).\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\right)\\). But that seems like a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is unusual for a coefficient. Typically, coefficients are numbers, so maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion, but that's not a single number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would be a term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the expansion, which is a sum of terms involving different powers of \\(c\\).\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is a term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a sum of terms. So, the coefficient isn't a single number but a sum of terms. That seems odd because coefficients are usually numerical, so maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and ignoring the second part, which is in terms of \\(c\\). But that seems too simplistic.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to see what the problem is asking again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the expansion, but that's not a numerical answer. So, perhaps the problem is expecting just the numerical coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and that's it.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients should be combined. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be 6 times the sum of all terms in the second expansion, which is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems like the coefficient is a polynomial, which is unusual.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by the entire term, but that seems too simplistic.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\right)\\).\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is typically a number, so perhaps the problem is expecting just the numerical coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and that's it. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be 6, and the rest is part of the term involving \\(c\\). But that seems inconsistent because coefficients usually include all multiplicative factors.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the problem differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in that case, I would need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is the constant term. Then, the coefficient would be 6 times that constant term.\n\nSo, let's calculate the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (assuming we're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) is 120. Therefore, the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if the problem is asking for the coefficient where \\(c\\) is zero or just the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\). If it's regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be a polynomial, but if it's specifically the term where \\(c\\) is zero, then it's 120. Since the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying \\(c\\), I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient in the entire product, which would involve all powers of \\(c\\), but that's a polynomial, which doesn't make sense as a coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts, so the coefficient is 6, but that seems too simple.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the user wrote: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient is a polynomial, but that's not standard.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a multiplier, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is a separate expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think of it another way. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of two expansions: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of those involving \\(c\\). Therefore, when you multiply the two expansions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first expansion, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a number, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by the entire term. But that seems too simplistic.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, or perhaps I'm misinterpreting it.

So, maybe the problem is expecting that. Let me check that again.\n\nIn \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times 20, which is 120. So, the answer is 120.\n\nI think that makes sense because when you multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20, so the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but actually, no. When you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's just 6. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120.\n\nSince the problem doesn't specify the power of \\(c\\), I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion.

But that's a sum of terms, so it's not a single coefficient.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting just the numerical coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and that's it. But that seems too simple, and I think the problem is expecting a numerical answer, so I'm more inclined to think that it's 120, considering the constant term.\n\nWait, let me check that again. If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and I want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, then the coefficient is 6 times the constant term of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, so 6 times 20 is 120.

Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems odd. Alternatively, maybe the question is only about the part with \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate variables. But that seems too straightforward.\n\nWait, no, let me check again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not correct because each term in the second part has different powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's considering all possible terms, but that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is the product of two polynomials. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) is in the second, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the first part, and it will be multiplied by all the terms from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be, because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of the entire product, but considering all variables. But that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That would make more sense.\n\nWait, that might be it. So, the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., 1, from the second part. So, to find this, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, which is 6.\n\nOkay, that makes sense. So, let's compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20. So, when you multiply these two parts, the term \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0\\) will have a coefficient of \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is indeed 6. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(k = 3\\) gives \\(c^{6 - 6} = c^0\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Yep, that's right.\n\nI think I've got it. The coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then multiplying them together.\n\n1. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by expanding \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion will have terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\), each multiplied by a binomial coefficient. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). Now, I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I should find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each. That means \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder if I need to consider the terms from this part as well. Wait, the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which are the variables in the first part. The second part has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when multiplied, any term involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) won't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, I think that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not an expression. Maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expansions, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times something, but that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not a coefficient times a polynomial.\n\nWait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me clarify: when you have two separate expressions multiplied together, the coefficients of terms in one part are independent of the other. So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), it comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by any term from the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it will just be 6 times that term. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), I think the coefficient is just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that can't be because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Wait, no, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every possible term from the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and they're asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't typical. Let me assume that. So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out to zero.\n\nIf that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply those two coefficients together.\n\nSo, as I found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand this using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\) so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, since the two parts are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients: 6 and 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out is when \\(k = 3\\), giving us \\(c^{6 - 2*3} = c^0\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when we multiply the two parts, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (assuming they meant \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)) is 120.\n\nWait, but the original problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". If they don't specify anything about \\(c\\), then technically, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every possible term from the second expansion, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). So, if they are just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial.\n\nTherefore, I think the problem must have been intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking about the part with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), ignoring the \\(c\\) terms, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's specifically asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the product, which includes terms with \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by all the terms from the second expansion, each with different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by each of those terms, but that would mean the coefficient isn't a single number but a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps the problem is misworded, and they actually want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and ignoring the \\(c\\) parts, but that seems odd because the entire expression includes \\(c\\) terms.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because coefficients are typically numerical. So, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion without considering \\(c\\), but that seems unclear.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is written correctly, and I need to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term from the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which isn't typical. Therefore, I think the intended question is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nSo, to summarize, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, so the combined coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering both parts of the product. First, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Then, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n$\\boxed{120}$"

But wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient.\n\nLet me think. When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), right? That means I don't need to consider the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\) because those will affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), but not their coefficients. Wait, no, actually, I'm just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will multiply the term \\(6a^2b^2\\), and since we're just interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficients from the second expansion will add up.\n\nWait, no, that might not be correct. Let me clarify. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the product of two separate expansions, and since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) can be treated as separate variables, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) will just contribute their coefficients multiplied by 6. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut wait, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), because that makes each term just its coefficient. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get:\n\n\\[\n\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\nSo, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Because when you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial, but only if the exponents add up to the desired term. Wait, no, in this case, we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes only from the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion, and then when multiplied by any term in the second expansion, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term remains as is, with its coefficient multiplied by the coefficient from the second expansion. So, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the second expansion doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each contributing a coefficient, so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider that the second expansion is independent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first expansion times the entire second expansion's sum of coefficients. So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because the second expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, each term in the second expansion will just multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing its coefficient. So, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should calculate the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first polynomial, and the second polynomial doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first polynomial times the sum of coefficients from the second polynomial.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n\n2. Find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is done by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n\n3. Multiply these two results: 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is that each term in the product will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or something like that, but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient will be the sum over all possible \\(m\\) of the coefficients from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) only comes from one term in the first expansion, which is 6, and each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient, so the total is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the product directly. Let me try that.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nSecond, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\nc^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in this second expansion. Therefore, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, giving terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., up to \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\).\n\nSince the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), each of these terms contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because they are all \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6.\n\nAs calculated earlier, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. When I set \\(c = 1\\), \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), which is correct. So, the sum of coefficients is 64, so yes, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't use the substitution method, I could compute the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion by adding up all the coefficients:\n\n- \\(c^6\\) has coefficient 1\n- \\(c^4\\) has coefficient 6\n- \\(c^2\\) has coefficient 15\n- The constant term is 20\n- \\(c^{-2}\\) has coefficient 15\n- \\(c^{-4}\\) has coefficient 6\n- \\(c^{-6}\\) has coefficient 1\n\nAdding these up: 1 + 6 = 7; 7 + 15 = 22; 22 + 20 = 42; 42 + 15 = 57; 57 + 6 = 63; 63 + 1 = 64. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there another way this could be approached?

Next, we find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\).

    "text": " \n\nWait, but the expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by another binomial, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to expand both parts separately and then see how the terms combine. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to consider all the terms from the second binomial. Let me think.\n\nFirst, let's focus on \\((a + b)^4\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion. Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, for \\(a^2b^2\\), the exponent on \\(a\\) is 2, which means \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the expression also has \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), I think the value of \\(c\\) terms doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I might need to multiply the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion? That can't be right because the question is asking for a specific coefficient, not an expression.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is just a number, not involving \\(c\\). So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would involve combining terms from both expansions. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion? But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\), and we're looking for a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So perhaps the only way for \\(a^2b^2\\) to appear without any \\(c\\) terms is if the coefficient from the second expansion is 1. But that doesn't seem right either.\n\nWait, let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and is multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but how do I find the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems too high. Let me check my reasoning again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only multiplied by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second expansion, because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nThat makes more sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\).\n\nSo, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that seems more reasonable. So, my initial mistake was thinking that the entire sum of coefficients was needed, but actually, only the constant term from the second expansion contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. So, the correct coefficient is 120.\n\nLet me verify this again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and it's multiplied by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as the product of two independent expansions. The \\(a^2b^2\\) term is 6, and it's multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only term from the second expansion that contributes to it is the constant term. So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we first determine the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNext, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Using the binomial theorem, this term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nMultiplying these results gives the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product as \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, the coefficient here is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, right? Because the other part is in terms of c and 1/c, which are different variables. So, when I multiply the two expressions together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve c at all, I need to find how many ways this term can appear when multiplying the two expansions. Wait, but actually, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first part, and the second part is in terms of c, when I multiply them, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second expansion will contribute a factor that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will give a term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) times something involving c. \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but it's part of a product with terms involving c. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, no, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those will have a different power of c, but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would just be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part. \n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. If I have two separate expansions, one in terms of a and b, and another in terms of c and 1/c, when I multiply them together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve c. So, in the product, the only way to get a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any c terms is if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20. Because if we multiply by any other term, like \\(c^6\\) or \\(c^{-6}\\), we would end up with a term like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the only term that would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second expansion. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. \n\nWait, but let me confirm that. So, the first part gives me \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and the second part, when expanded, has a term with coefficient 20 that's just \\(c^0\\), so when I multiply them, it's 6 times 20, which is 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of the coefficients from each part, but only considering the terms that don't involve c. So, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the first part, and the only term in the second part that doesn't involve c is the constant term, which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nWait, but I should make sure that I'm correctly identifying the constant term in the second expansion. Let me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nSo, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of c is zero, because that's the constant term. So, we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). So, that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 20, which is 120. So, the final answer should be 120. \n\nWait, but let me check my reasoning again. When I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion, which has a coefficient of 6, when multiplied by each term in the second expansion, it will produce terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), etc. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term where the exponent of c is zero. So, only the term where we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms would have some power of c, so they wouldn't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two coefficients, but only considering the necessary terms. So, the coefficient from the first part is 6, and from the second part, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20, so the product is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe by considering generating functions or multinomial coefficients, but I think the approach I took is correct. \n\nSo, to recap: \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. \n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem and find the constant term, which is 20. \n\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion to give the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

But wait, actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), their coefficients won't be affected by the terms involving \\(c\\). So, maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think. The entire expression is a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them together, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not right because each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut that doesn't make sense because the variables are different. So, perhaps the \\(a^2b^2\\) term's coefficient isn't affected by the \\(c\\) terms at all. Wait, no, because when you multiply, for example, \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\).

Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).

So, in that case, we would need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, and then multiply that by 6. \n\nLet me see. The general term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, does that mean we consider all possible powers of \\(c\\), or only the term where \\(c\\) is to the zero power? \n\nI think it's the latter, because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make much sense as a single coefficient. So, probably, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Therefore, the answer would be 120. \n\nBut just to make sure, let me think again. If we consider the entire expression, each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will multiply each term from the second part, which has different powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second part multiplied by 6. But that would give a coefficient that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a single number. Therefore, I think the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient when considering only the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power, so that the entire term is \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nTherefore, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me confirm this. Suppose I expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) separately. The first expansion will have terms up to \\(a^4b^0\\) and \\(a^0b^4\\), and the second expansion will have terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\) with various coefficients. When I multiply them together, each term from the first expansion will multiply each term from the second, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), ..., down to \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. \n\nBut if I consider that, then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. \n\nI think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because otherwise, it's not a single coefficient but a polynomial. So, I'll go with 120. \n\nBut to be thorough, let me check both interpretations. \n\nFirst, if we consider all powers of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * (sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)) = 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nSecond, if we consider only the term where \\(c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nGiven that the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without mentioning \\(c\\), it's ambiguous. However, in algebra, when you have multiple variables, the coefficient of a term with specific exponents in some variables usually implies that you're considering the term with those exponents regardless of the other variables. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 384. \n\nBut wait, another perspective: in the product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one set of variables is the sum of the products of coefficients from each polynomial that result in that term when multiplied. So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), since it's independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because any term in the second polynomial, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but with different powers of \\(c\\). \n\nSo, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because otherwise, it's not clear what the coefficient is\u2014it would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, I think the intended answer is 120. \n\nBut to make sure, let me think about how the problem is phrased. It says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be the sum over all \\(k\\) of (coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{2k - 6}\\) in the product). Wait, no, that's not quite right. \n\nWait, no, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these, you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the sum of all these coefficients, which is 6*(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6*64 = 384. \n\nBut if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's only the term where \\(c^0\\), which is 6*20 = 120. \n\nSo, I think the problem is ambiguous. However, in most math problems, when they ask for the coefficient of a term with certain variables, they usually mean the term with those exponents and any exponents in the other variables. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 384. \n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Let me check an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)(c + d)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1*(c + d) = c + d, which is a polynomial. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is a polynomial in the other variables. So, if the problem had said \"the coefficient of \\(a\\)\", it would be \\(c + d\\). Similarly, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), specifically 6*(sum of coefficients in the second polynomial) = 6*64 = 384, but that's just a number, because the sum of coefficients is 64. Wait, no, the sum of coefficients is when you set \\(c = 1\\), so it's 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6*64 = 384. \n\nWait, but in the earlier example, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + d\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. So, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), specifically 6*(sum of coefficients in the second polynomial when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\)). But the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is when \\(c = 1\\), which is 64, so the coefficient is 6*64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, no, the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, which is a number, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6*64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had said \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)\", then it's 120. \n\nGiven that, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), so it's 384. \n\nBut I'm still a bit confused because in the example, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is a polynomial, but in our case, the sum of coefficients is a number. So, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for 384. \n\nWait, let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum over all \\(k\\) of (coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial) * (coefficient of \\(c^{something}\\) in the second). \n\nBut actually, no, that's not quite right. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. So, it's 6*(\\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is 6*(\\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is usually a number. So, perhaps it's asking for the constant term, i.e., the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6*20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6*(sum of coefficients in the second polynomial) = 6*64 = 384. \n\nI think the key here is to interpret what is meant by \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". In the context of multiple variables, the coefficient of a term with specific exponents in some variables typically refers to the coefficient when considering all possible exponents in the other variables. So, in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial in the other variables. However, since the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number, I think it's more likely that they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nBut to be absolutely sure, let me think about the problem again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). We need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). If we expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\text{coefficient} \\times a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from -6 to 6 in even steps. \n\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient from the first part is 6. Then, for each term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we have coefficients multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is not a single number. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nAs I calculated earlier, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, so 6*20 = 120. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 120. \n\nBut just to make sure, let me calculate the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). We set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, yes, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think that's the correct answer. So, I'll go with 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, applying the binomial theorem, we get:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\n\nThat means the expansion will have terms like \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\), and so on, up to \\(\\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\n\\]\n\nOkay, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. But wait, the original problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire expression, not just \\((a + b)^4\\). That means I have to multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nHmm, so does that mean I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of these two expansions? Let me think. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), right? Because the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when I multiply these two expansions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will only come from the first part, and the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) will come from the second part. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression should just be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), maybe we don't need to consider the second part at all? Or wait, no, actually, the entire expression is a product, so each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nWait, no, that might not be right. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, it would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part is a constant multiple of some power of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the entire coefficient would be the product of 6 (from the first part) and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me check. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when you expand it, you get terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^{-m}\\). So, the only way to get a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is if the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., \\(m = 0\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. \n\nAh, so that makes more sense. So, I need to compute two things: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply those two coefficients together to get the final coefficient in the product. \n\nOkay, so let's compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem for this. The expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\):\n\n\\[\n6 - 2m = 0 \\\\\n2m = 6 \\\\\nm = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\n\\]\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, 6! is 720, but 3! is 6, so 6!/(3!3!) is 720/(6*6) = 720/36 = 20. Yeah, that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nLet me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. \n\n1. I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem, which gave me 6. That seems correct because \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. Then, I needed to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). I used the binomial theorem again, set the exponent equal to zero, solved for \\(m = 3\\), and found the coefficient to be 20. That seems correct because \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. Finally, I multiplied the two coefficients together: 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply for the corresponding terms.\n\nSo, I think my answer is correct. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"

I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means I'm only interested in the terms from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), because the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't contain \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, maybe I can focus solely on expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) there, and then the second part will just be a separate expansion that I might not need to consider for this particular term. \n\nLet me confirm that thought. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are only in the second part, the terms in the product will be combinations of terms from each expansion. So, when I multiply them together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion and any term in the second expansion. But since the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire second expansion evaluated at some point? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those will contribute to the overall product, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. \n\nWait, is that right? Let me think again. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when I multiply these two together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will come from the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in the second expansion will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\), effectively scaling it by the coefficients from the second expansion. So, the total coefficient will be the product of the two coefficients. \n\nWait, but actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient from the first part times the entire sum of coefficients from the second part, because every term in the second expansion is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(\\text{Coeff}_{a^2b^2}[(a + b)^4] \\times \\text{Coeff}_{c^0}\\left[\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\right]\\). Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), so the only term in the second expansion that would contribute to a term without \\(c\\) is the constant term, i.e., where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, actually, I don't need the sum of all coefficients, but just the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. \n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term in the second expansion, say \\(c^k\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is a different term. So, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) remains as a term without any \\(c\\) is if it's multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, which is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). \n\nOkay, so let me break this down into two parts: first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), and second, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). We need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). \n\nCalculating that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20.\n\nNow, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we multiply the two coefficients we found: 6 and 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. \n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the coefficient from the first part is 6, and the coefficient from the second part is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. \n\nJust to double-check, maybe I can think about it another way. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and when multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20, so the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that makes sense. \n\nAlternatively, if I consider the entire expansion, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, but only the constant term will result in a term that is \\(a^2b^2\\) times 1 (since all other terms will have a power of \\(c\\)). So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts: finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\n1. **Finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(c^0\\) corresponds to \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the two coefficients found:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\boxed{120}."
