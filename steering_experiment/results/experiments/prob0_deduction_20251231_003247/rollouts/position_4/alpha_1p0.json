    "text": " Let's start with expanding \\((a + b)^4\\). \n\nUsing the binomial theorem, \\((a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). The terms would be:\n\n- When \\(k = 0\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 = 1 \\cdot a^4 \\cdot 1 = a^4\\)\n- When \\(k = 1\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 = 4a^3b\\)\n- When \\(k = 2\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\)\n- When \\(k = 3\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 = 4ab^3\\)\n- When \\(k = 4\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4 = 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot b^4 = b^4\\)\n\nSo, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). \n\nNow, the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Looking at the expansion, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient is 6. \n\nWait, but hold on a second. The original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how that affects the coefficient. \n\nLet me write the entire expression again: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term from the first part, we need to see how it interacts with the second part.\n\nWait, but actually, the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), and the first part is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when I multiply them together, the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). That is, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but the variables are separate. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. But no, actually, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term from the first part, it would be multiplied by all the terms in the second part. But since the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), which is a different variable, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is actually just the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the variables are separate.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the expansion of the second part, which would give me terms like \\(6c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), etc., but that can't be right because the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me check.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, when you multiply the two expressions together, you get terms that are products of terms from each part. So, for example, \\(a^4\\) from the first part multiplied by \\(c^6\\) from the second part would give \\(a^4c^6\\), and so on. But when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term from the first part, it would be multiplied by every term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes to a different term in the product, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would be the original coefficient times the sum of the coefficients from the second part.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the sum of the coefficients in the second part is just the value when \\(c = 1\\). Let me check: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) evaluated at \\(c = 1\\) is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times 64, which is 384? But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), regardless of the other terms involving \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would just be 6, as I found earlier. But I'm not sure if that's the case because the problem includes the entire product, so it's more likely that I need to consider how the two parts interact.\n\nWait, let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part because each term in the second part has a coefficient that gets multiplied by 6 (the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part). \n\nSo, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let's take a simpler example to test this. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the first part is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Let's expand it:\n\n\\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\)\n\\((c + 1/c) = c + 1/c\\)\n\nMultiplying them: \\(a^2c + a^2(1/c) + 2abc + 2ab(1/c) + b^2c + b^2(1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) is indeed 1 (from \\(a^2c\\)) and 1 (from \\(a^2(1/c)\\)), so total coefficient is 2, which matches 1 * 2. So, that seems to work.\n\nSimilarly, if I take \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), the sum of coefficients in the second part is \\((1 + 1)^2 = 4\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the first part is 1, so the coefficient in the product should be 1 * 4 = 4. Let's check:\n\n\\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\)\n\\((c + 1/c)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\)\n\nMultiplying them: \\(a^2c^2 + a^2(2) + a^2(1/c^2) + 2abc^2 + 2ab(2) + 2ab(1/c^2) + b^2c^2 + b^2(2) + b^2(1/c^2)\\). The terms with \\(a^2\\) are \\(a^2c^2\\), \\(2a^2\\), and \\(a^2(1/c^2)\\). So, the coefficients are 1, 2, and 1, adding up to 4, which is correct. So, this method works.\n\nTherefore, applying this to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the first polynomial is multiplied by all the terms in the second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the original coefficient in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part because each term in the second part contributes to a different term in the product, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself is just the product of the original coefficient and the sum of the coefficients from the second part.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to write the entire product, it would be the sum over all possible combinations of terms from each part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by every term in the second part, each contributing their own coefficients. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another approach: maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6 times the expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which isn't a single coefficient. So, perhaps I was correct earlier that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then in the product, each term will be of the form \\(a^k b^m c^n\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all \\(n\\) of the coefficients from the first part times the coefficients from the second part for each \\(n\\). But since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient is just the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives a different term in the product, but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) itself isn't affected by the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, that's not quite right because the \\(c\\) terms are separate variables. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second part, each term contributes to a different term in the product, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself is the product of the original coefficient and the sum of the coefficients from the second part.\n\nWait, maybe a better way to see it is that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all the terms in the other polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term from the first polynomial, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but the coefficient for each of these terms is 6 times the coefficient from the second polynomial. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually the sum of all these coefficients, which is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because each term in the product would have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself isn't a single number; it's part of multiple terms. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we treat \\(c\\) as a separate variable and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that can't be because the coefficient should be a single number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would involve all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is only multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\), so the coefficient would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a single number, so perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), meaning that we're to treat \\(c\\) as a separate variable and just find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that the entire product is a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the expansion of the second part multiplied by 6. So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not a number, it's another expression. Therefore, perhaps the problem is miswritten, or I'm misinterpreting it.\n\nWait, maybe I should go back to the original problem. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). That is, the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero. In that case, we would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the product.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. Therefore, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the product.\n\nIn that case, the approach would be to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply those two coefficients together.\n\nSo, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found earlier.\n\nNext, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do this, we can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, multiplying the two coefficients together: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times 20 (from \\(c^0\\)) gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Let's go through it again.\n\nFirst, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is indeed 6.\n\nNext, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\). The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). Setting \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the answer was 384, but that was when I considered the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, leading to 6 * 64 = 384. But that was under the assumption that the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable and considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But now, I realize that the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. Therefore, the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, leading to 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTo confirm, let's think about what the product looks like. Each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 6 * 20 = 120. All other terms involving \\(c\\) would contribute to different terms in the product, such as \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but the problem is specifically asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies \\(c^0\\).\n\nTherefore, the correct coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

But wait, in the first expansion, we have terms with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and in the second expansion, we have terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since the variables are different, the only way for the product to have a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is if we multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion by any term from the second expansion, because the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since the variables are different, the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) is when we take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first and multiply it by any term from the second, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, actually, the coefficient would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because we are looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\). So, actually, the product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\) for various \\(k\\), but if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then we might need to sum over all possible coefficients. But wait, no, that's not correct either because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and when multiplied by each term in the second part, it would result in terms that have \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without considering \\(c\\), then perhaps we need to consider the entire expansion, but that doesn't make sense because \\(c\\) is another variable. Alternatively, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which would be the constant term. Hmm, that might be it. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would involve considering only the terms where the power of \\(c\\) is zero. So, let me think carefully.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that can't be right because the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of \\(c\\), but that would mean summing over all possible \\(c\\) terms, which would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, but the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the sum of its coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, if I take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and multiply it by 64, that would give me 384. But that would be the sum of all coefficients in the entire product where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of \\(c\\). However, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without considering \\(c\\), that might not make sense because \\(c\\) is another variable. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a typo and meant to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would require me to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\).\n\nLet me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It says \"in\" the product, so it's possible that they mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be the sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms. But that seems a bit odd because usually, when you're asked for a coefficient in a product, you have to specify all variables. Alternatively, perhaps they just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, multiplied by the entire second part, but that would be treating the second part as a scalar, which isn't correct.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you have a product of two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of corresponding terms in each expression. But in this case, the terms in the first expression are in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the terms in the second are in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider that in the product, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expression will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), where \\(k\\) varies. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term from the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on \\(c\\), then that would mean summing over all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for all \\(k\\), which is equivalent to 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nBut wait, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1/1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Because if you set \\(c = 1\\), you get the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. If you don't specify anything about \\(c\\), then technically, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times each coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term with respect to \\(c\\).\n\nLet me try that approach. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, then multiply them together.\n\nWe already know that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the expansion we did earlier, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so:\n\n\\(6 - 2m = 0\\)\n\nSolving for \\(m\\):\n\n\\(2m = 6\\)\n\n\\(m = 3\\)\n\nSo, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, multiplying the two coefficients together: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) * 20 (from \\(c^0\\)) = 120.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. If I expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(c^0\\) is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{6 - 6} = 20c^0\\), so that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering only the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But since the problem just asks for the coefficient, I think they are asking for the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me consider the entire product:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\left( \\text{terms with } a \\text{ and } b \\right) \\times \\left( \\text{terms with } c \\text{ and } 1/c \\right)\n\\]\n\nSo, when you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying \\(c\\), that's ambiguous. However, in most contexts, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term in a product of multiple variables, you're usually expected to consider the term with all specified variables and implicitly the others set to their lowest or specified exponents. But in this case, since \\(c\\) is another variable, it's more likely that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\).\n\nTherefore, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nLet me confirm this by another method. Let's compute the entire product and see the coefficient.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nSecond, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first will be multiplied by each term in the second, resulting in:\n\n\\(6a^2b^2c^6 + 6a^2b^2c^4 + 90a^2b^2c^2 + 120a^2b^2 + 90a^2b^2c^{-2} + 6a^2b^2c^{-4} + 6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (without considering \\(c\\)) would be the sum of all coefficients attached to \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). But that would be 6*(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6*(64) = 384. But that seems too large, and it's not the usual way such problems are phrased. Alternatively, if we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120, as we found earlier.\n\nGiven that the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", it's more likely that they want the coefficient when considering all variables, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of a product with \\(c\\) terms, perhaps they just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. However, that would be 6*64 = 384, but that seems unlikely because usually, coefficients are given for specific terms, not summed over all variables.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and they actually want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Given that, I think 120 is the more reasonable answer.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms, that would mean that in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in \\(c\\), which is 20. So, 6*20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20.\n\n3. Multiply the two coefficients: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"

    "text": " Since the first part of the expression is \\((a + b)^4\\), I can expand that part first to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nLet me write that down. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion will be the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me check that: if \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient here is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nBut wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the expansion of both parts and see how they multiply together. However, the question is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so maybe the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Or do they? Hmm, let me think.\n\nWait, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), don't change the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). That is, I need to find the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that are constants, because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a constant, it remains \\(a^2b^2\\). Alternatively, if I multiply by a term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), it would change the variables, so those wouldn't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by the coefficient 6 from the first part. That makes sense because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by the constant term, you'll still have \\(6 \\times \\text{constant} \\times a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nAlright, so now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). I need the term where the exponent is 0 because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Since these two parts are multiplied together, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait a second, let me just make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and since the \\(c\\) terms are separate, they don't interfere with the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, when I multiply the two expansions, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and the constant term from the second part. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to think about the entire expansion, each term would be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, for the term to be \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), we need \\(4 - k = 2\\), \\(k = 2\\), and \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Yep, that confirms it.\n\nI think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120. So, the answer should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. This corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Setting \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) gives \\(m = 3\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\n\\]\nSo, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nMultiplying the coefficient from the first part by the constant term from the second part gives:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Using the binomial theorem, the expansion will have terms like \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would correspond to \\(k = 2\\), right? Because when \\(k = 2\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). Let me calculate that coefficient. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, so the coefficient is 6. So, the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider both parts together. But hold on, the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). Hmm, is that right?

Hmm, but that doesn't make much sense because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you'll get terms involving \\(c\\) as well. So, maybe the question is considering the entire expression and just wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) part. That is, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by whatever comes from the other expansion.\n\nWait, but actually, in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, so perhaps the question is treating \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) as separate variables, but it's only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the entire expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, because the other part is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's just 6. But that seems too simple.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the entire expression is a product of two polynomials. So, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, for example, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is not just 6. Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Hmm, that seems plausible.\n\nWait, let me think again. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), so the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Alternatively, if I don't set \\(c = 1\\), but instead consider that each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the terms that multiply to give that term. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the other expansion, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by every term in the other expansion, hence the coefficient becomes 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think of it as the entire product, and to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), so it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is considering the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me check that. Let's compute the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of coefficients, we can substitute \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, yes, the sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I don't substitute \\(c = 1\\). Instead, I think about the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because each term in the \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the other expansion, so the total coefficient becomes 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let me first compute \\((a + b)^4\\). The expansion is:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I thought earlier.\n\nNow, the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the terms that multiply to give that term. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the other expansion, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by every term in the other expansion, hence the coefficient becomes 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think of it as the entire product, and to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), so it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me confirm this by considering a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\). Multiplying these together, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be 1 (from \\(a^2\\)) multiplied by the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\), which is 1 + 1 = 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Indeed, the product is \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 2, which matches 1 * 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2 (from \\(2ab\\)) multiplied by 2, giving 4. Looking at the product, the terms with \\(ab\\) are \\(2abc\\) and \\(2ab/c\\), each with coefficient 2, so total coefficient is 4, which is correct.\n\nSo, applying the same logic to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed when \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) and not worrying about the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6, but that seems unlikely because the entire expression includes \\(c\\) terms. So, I think the correct approach is to consider the entire product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), which would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the terms that multiply to give that term. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because \\(c^0\\) is the only term that doesn't affect the power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by 6.\n\nLet me try that approach. So, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when the exponents from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)), giving 120.\n\nWait, now I'm confused because earlier I thought it was 384, and now I'm getting 120. Which one is correct?\n\nLet me clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) with the \\(c^0\\) term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) with any other power of \\(c\\), you'll get a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is not just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 384, which was based on multiplying by the sum of all coefficients, but that would give the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times every possible power of \\(c\\), which isn't what the problem is asking. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), but in the product, each term is a product of a term from the first polynomial and a term from the second. So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nLet me confirm this with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). As before, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\). The product is \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 1 (from \\(a^2\\)) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 0, because there is no \\(c^0\\) term in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\). Wait, but that contradicts my earlier conclusion. Wait, no, in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\), the terms are \\(c^1\\) and \\(c^{-1}\\), so there is no \\(c^0\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product would be 1 * 0 = 0, which is correct because in the product, there is no term with just \\(a^2\\); all \\(a^2\\) terms are multiplied by \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2 (from \\(2ab\\)) multiplied by the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\), which is 2, giving 4, which matches the product.\n\nWait, so in this example, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is zero because there's no \\(c^0\\) term in the second polynomial. Therefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, giving 120.\n\nTherefore, the correct coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but that was a mistake because I was considering the sum of all coefficients, which would include all powers of \\(c\\), but the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\nI think that's the correct approach because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), so we only consider the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, leaving \\(c^0\\), which is 1. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nLet me just double-check the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\). The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), which is correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"

    "text": " Let me write down the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\).\n\nExpanding \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem, each term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\). So, the terms will be:\n\n- When \\(k = 0\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 = 1 \\cdot a^4\\)\n- When \\(k = 1\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 = 4a^3b\\)\n- When \\(k = 2\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\)\n- When \\(k = 3\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 = 4ab^3\\)\n- When \\(k = 4\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4 = 1 \\cdot b^4\\)\n\nSo, the expansion is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). From this, I can see that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6.\n\nNow, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this term \\(a^2b^2\\) interacts with the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can think of this as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since the second part only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables, maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, let me think.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, actually, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is just a single term, and when multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, it will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. But since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's just a constant factor when considering the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.\n\nWait, that might not be right. Let me clarify. The entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term from the first expansion gets multiplied by each term from the second expansion. However, since the second expansion only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are separate variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't be affected by the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the second part isn't a constant. It's a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). So, actually, when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) varies. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would require that the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, right? Because if there's any \\(c\\) term, it wouldn't be just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I need to find the term in the second expansion that is \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term, because when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it will give the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which is what we're interested in.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, I need to find both coefficients and then multiply them together.\n\nI already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on that.\n\nAgain, I can use the binomial theorem to expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The expansion will be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe are looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\) so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(k = 3\\) is the constant term. Let's compute that term's coefficient.\n\nThe coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Let me compute it correctly. \\(6! = 720\\), \\(3! = 6\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Yes, that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\)). So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, and when you multiply it by the entire second expansion, which includes all the terms with c's, the only way to get a term that is just a\u00b2b\u00b2 (without any c's) is to multiply 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20. So, yes, that would give 6 * 20 a\u00b2b\u00b2, which is 120a\u00b2b\u00b2. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any errors. First, the binomial coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of c is zero occurs at \\(k = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it another way. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanding, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve c, we can consider that the other terms with c would create terms like a\u00b2b\u00b2c^k, which aren't a\u00b2b\u00b2. Therefore, the only contribution to a\u00b2b\u00b2 comes from multiplying a\u00b2b\u00b2 by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by multiplying the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n   - The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n   - The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which happens at \\(k = 3\\).\n   - The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. Multiply the two coefficients:\n   - \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2 because the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the value of \\(k\\) such that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). That makes sense because \\(4 - 2 = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\).

So, I also have to consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I think this is another binomial expansion, so I can use the binomial theorem here as well. The expansion would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).

Now, when I multiply this by \\((a + b)^4\\), which we've expanded, the entire expression becomes the product of two sums. So, it's \\(\\left(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\right) \\times \\left(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\right)\\).\n\nBut I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from multiplying the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion by any term from the second expansion, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second expansion, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. Wait, no, that's not right. Actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply when the variables are the same. But in this case, since the second polynomial only has \\(c\\) terms, the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with \\(c\\). So, actually, every term in the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be 6 times the entire second expansion. But wait, no, that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not the entire expression.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand this product, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is only in the first part, and the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, in the entire product, each term will be of the form \\(a^{k}b^{4 - k}c^{m}\\) or something like that, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, I need to consider all terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and sum their coefficients.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But that can't be right because the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which would be \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). But then the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384, which seems high. Wait, but maybe that's correct?\n\nWait, let me check. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the constant term in the second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), but the second expansion has \\(c\\) terms, actually, when you multiply, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times \\(c\\) raised to some power, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times each coefficient, so the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is indeed when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But let me verify this because I might be making a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm supposed to treat \\(c\\) as a variable and the entire expression as a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem just asks for the coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, no, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which in the context of the entire expression would be a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\). So, the coefficient would be the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. But that seems odd because the problem might expect a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. Perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you multiply the two expansions, every term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared will have coefficients from both expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check this with a different approach. Let's consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the terms that multiply to give that term. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial by any term from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. The sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is indeed \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the constant term in the second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second, so \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, leading to \\(a^2b^2\\) times each coefficient of \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem just asks for the coefficient, so maybe it's expecting a numerical value, implying that perhaps the term \\(c^0\\) is considered, i.e., the constant term.\n\nWait, that might make sense. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. In that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the product. So, that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion, which is 6, multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion.\n\nSo, let's calculate the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial expansion, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that seems more plausible. So, perhaps I initially misunderstood the problem and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Let me confirm this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but that seems unlikely because the problem probably expects a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high, and I'm not sure if that's the intended interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem asks for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach it differently. Let's expand both parts separately and then see how they multiply.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\) expands to \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nNext, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expands to \\(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. The sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems to contradict my earlier thought where I considered only the constant term. But perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\), and I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would include all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem just says \"the coefficient\", which might imply that it's considering the entire coefficient as a polynomial, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be 6*(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6). So, the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem just asks for the coefficient, so maybe it's expecting a numerical value, implying that perhaps the term is \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6*20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so it's 6 times the entire expansion, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't seem right. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, to confirm, let me compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product.\n\nFrom \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nFrom \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) which is 20.\n\nSo, when you multiply these two, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it might be 384 if considering all terms, but that's when the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. But I think that's incorrect because the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written in a way that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and the question is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without considering \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, but the problem expects a numerical coefficient, so I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have the product of two polynomials, \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then each term in the product will be a term from the first polynomial times a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is not a single number but a polynomial. But the problem asks for \"the coefficient\", which suggests it's a single number, so perhaps the problem is only considering the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), i.e., \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would indeed be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but that seems unlikely because the problem probably expects a numerical answer.\n\nWait, maybe I can check by considering the entire expression. Let me compute the product:\n\n\\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\)\n\n\\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\)\n\nSo, when I multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, giving:\n\n\\(6a^2b^2c^6 + 6a^2b^2c^4 + 6a^2b^2c^2 + 6a^2b^2 \\times 20 + 6a^2b^2/c^2 + 6a^2b^2/c^4 + 6a^2b^2/c^6\\)\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is \\(6(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6)\\). Therefore, the coefficient is this polynomial. But the problem asks for \"the coefficient\", which might mean that it's expecting a numerical value, so perhaps it's referring to the constant term, which is 6*20=120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is the entire polynomial I just wrote, but that seems unlikely because the problem probably expects a numerical answer. Therefore, I think the intended answer is 120.\n\nWait, to make sure, let me consider that when the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", it's considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\), and the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But if the problem expects a numerical coefficient, it must be referring to the constant term in \\(c\\), i.e., the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nTherefore, after this lengthy consideration, I think the correct answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " The problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. Let me write down the expansion for \\((a + b)^4\\). \n\nUsing the binomial theorem, each term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. So, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\) and \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). That means \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, that part is 6. \n\nNow, the expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder if I need to consider this part as well. Wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, does that mean the coefficient is just 6? Or is there something else I need to consider? Let me think. \n\nWait, maybe the entire expression is a product of two expansions: one in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that term must come from the product where the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, I think I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion. That makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term, you just get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant, so the coefficient would be 6 times that constant. \n\nAlright, so now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nI need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That is, \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and the constant term comes from the second part. When you multiply them, you get \\(a^2b^2 \\times 20\\), so the coefficient is indeed 20 multiplied by 6, which is 120. That seems right. \n\nIs there any other term that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\)? For example, if there were terms in the second expansion that also had \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), but looking at \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it only has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so it doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, all the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts come solely from the first expansion, and the coefficients are just scaled by the constants from the second expansion. \n\nTherefore, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120. \n\nJust to recap, the steps were:\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem and find the constant term, which is 20.\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together to get the final coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is 120.\n\nI don't think I missed anything here. So, yeah, the answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, maybe the second part doesn't affect it? Hmm, not sure. Wait, actually, no, because the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are separate variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when we multiply them, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms won't interact with the \\(c\\) terms.

Let me think again. If I have two separate polynomials multiplied together, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and one in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), then each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part.

So, actually, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes a coefficient, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by each of those, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nBut wait, no, actually, the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\).

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, how do I find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? \n\nI remember that the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting 1 for all variables.

So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, let me double-check that.

Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, it becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, the original expression is the product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply them together, each term in the first expansion will multiply each term in the second expansion. That means the entire expression is the sum over all possible products of terms from each expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can focus on the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and see how it interacts with the second expansion.\n\nWait, actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term only comes from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial and any term in the second polynomial. Because the second polynomial has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) at all. So, when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the only terms that will contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) are those where I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by a constant (i.e., terms without \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\)). But wait, looking at the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the terms are \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, unless \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which would make the term a constant, the other terms would have some power of \\(c\\), which would affect the overall expression.\n\nSo, let's see. For the second expansion, when is \\(6 - 2m = 0\\)? Solving for \\(m\\), \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) implies \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the term when \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20 \\times 1 = 20\\). So, that's the only constant term in the second expansion. Therefore, when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by this term, I get \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2 = 120a^2b^2\\). All other terms in the second expansion would have a factor of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which means when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) would give terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), which are not \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the only contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure I'm not missing something. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, the entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion and every term in the second expansion. But since the second expansion includes terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), unless those terms are constants, they won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. Wait, no, actually, they will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, but the question is whether those products contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the overall expression.\n\nWait, no, because the overall expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables are separate. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which are in terms of \\(c\\). Therefore, each term in the product will be of the form \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\text{something with } c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But since the second polynomial is a sum of terms with \\(c\\), when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by the entire second polynomial, you get \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Is the problem asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\)? Or is it asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\)? Let me check the original problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It just says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), right? Or, more accurately, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, we need to sum over all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the second expansion is separate. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the result is a polynomial where each term is a product of a term from the first polynomial and a term from the second. So, for example, \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial would be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which are \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the resulting terms would be \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(15a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(20a^2b^2\\), \\(15a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), and \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). So, each of these terms has a different power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (without any \\(c\\) terms) is only the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, which is \\(20a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 20 times the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial.\n\nWait, no, hold on. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is 6, as we saw earlier. Then, when we multiply by the second polynomial, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes a constant term 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Because the constant term in the second expansion is 20, and when you multiply that by \\(6a^2b^2\\), you get \\(120a^2b^2\\), which is the only term in the product that has \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. All other terms would have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), which means they wouldn't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) alone.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then actually, no. Because the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the context of the entire expression would mean the coefficient when considering all variables. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\), each of these would be separate terms. So, perhaps the question is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). Because otherwise, if it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), that would be the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\), which would be the product of the coefficients from each expansion. But I think that's not the case here.\n\nWait, no, actually, in the product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term like \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of the products of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the coefficients of the terms in the second polynomial. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first polynomial and not in the second, which only has \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the second polynomial isn't a constant.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to clarify. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of the coefficients of each term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), where \\(k\\) can be any integer. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which, in the context of the entire expression, would mean the coefficient when considering all variables. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\), each of these would be separate terms.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so that the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which is a bit ambiguous. Alternatively, maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), meaning the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that would be the product of the coefficients from each expansion, which is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 would be 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). In the product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^l c^m\\), where \\(k + l = 4\\) and \\(m\\) is determined by the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of the coefficients of all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But in reality, each term in the product is a separate term, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^m\\) is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^m\\) in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually a polynomial in \\(c\\), where each term is 6 times the corresponding coefficient from the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is ambiguous. It could mean the coefficient when treating \\(c\\) as another variable, in which case it's a polynomial, or it could mean the coefficient when ignoring \\(c\\), which would just be 6 times the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nGiven that the problem is written as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying any \\(c\\) terms, I think it's more likely that they want the coefficient when considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems unusual. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a function of \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right.\n\nSo, if that's the case, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. As we found earlier, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let me write out the entire product:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\left(1a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\right) \\times \\left(1c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + 1c^{-6}\\right)\n\\]\n\nSo, when I multiply these together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(120a^2b^2\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), and \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120, which is the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). All other coefficients are for terms with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k \\neq 0\\). Therefore, the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me consider another approach. Maybe I can think of the entire product as a product of two separate polynomials and use the concept of coefficients in the product. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum over all possible products of coefficients from each polynomial that result in \\(a^2b^2\\). But since the second polynomial only has terms in \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial. Therefore, it's \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, that confirms it.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider generating functions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum over all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that's different from what I thought earlier. Wait, but that would be the case if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all powers of \\(c\\), i.e., treating \\(c\\) as 1. But I don't think that's the case here because the problem is asking for the coefficient in the product, not when evaluating at \\(c = 1\\).\n\nSo, to clarify, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 384\\). But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 120. So, which interpretation is correct?\n\nLooking back at the problem statement: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" The term \"coefficient\" in this context usually refers to the numerical factor in front of the variables, considering all variables. So, if the term \\(a^2b^2\\) appears multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\), each of those would have their own coefficients. Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of \\(c\\), it's ambiguous. However, in most cases, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a specific term in a product of polynomials, it's referring to the coefficient when considering all variables, meaning the term where the exponents of all variables match. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, which is \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me check both interpretations. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), meaning the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, so 6 times 20 is 120.\n\nGiven that the problem is written as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying any \\(c\\) terms, it's more likely that they are asking for the coefficient when considering all variables, which would be 120. Because if they wanted the sum over all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, they would probably specify that they want the sum or the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\). Therefore, I think the correct answer is 120.\n\nSo, to recap, the steps are:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. Find the constant term, which is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. Multiply the two coefficients together: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Let's start by expanding \\((a + b)^4\\). \n\nExpanding \\((a + b)^4\\), using the binomial theorem, each term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\). So, the terms would be:\n\n- When \\(k = 0\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} a^4 b^0 = 1 \\cdot a^4 = a^4\\)\n- When \\(k = 1\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} a^3 b^1 = 4 a^3 b\\)\n- When \\(k = 2\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2 b^2 = 6 a^2 b^2\\)\n- When \\(k = 3\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} a^1 b^3 = 4 a b^3\\)\n- When \\(k = 4\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} a^0 b^4 = 1 \\cdot b^4 = b^4\\)\n\nSo, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). Now, the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in this case is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, maybe I need to consider the entire product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the combined expansion. Hmm, but actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), maybe the coefficients involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with the coefficients involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Let me think about that.\n\nSo, when I multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not exactly right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, so the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one polynomial, and the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the other. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2 \\times (1/c)^k\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would be the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), multiplied by 6. Wait, no, that's not correct either because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), it would create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2(1/c)^k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Wait, but in the product, every term will have some combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) by itself would only appear if there's a term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that is a constant term, i.e., \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense.\n\nSo, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then multiply it by 6.\n\nAlright, so let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\) so \\(m = 3\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 6! is 720, and 3! is 6, so 720/(6*6) = 720/36 = 20. So, yes, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nSo, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when we multiply these two expressions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (since it's multiplied by \\(c^0\\)) would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) has a term 6a^2b^2, and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a term 20c^0. When we multiply them, the term becomes 6*20 a^2b^2c^0 = 120a^2b^2. So, yes, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first polynomial and we're looking for it without any \\(c\\) terms, we only consider the constant term from the second polynomial, which is 20, and multiply it by 6.\n\nSo, I think that's the answer. The coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2 b^2 = 6 a^2 b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we solve \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), giving \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

Okay, that's straightforward.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I think I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of these two expansions. But wait, the first part only has \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), while the second part only has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply them, the terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with the terms in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). That means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression should just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficients in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't be affected by the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product should just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense either because each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a power of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but wait, no, because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by each term in \\((a + b)^4\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not correct because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384? Wait, that seems too high. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no. When you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms in each expression that, when multiplied together, give the desired term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't combine with terms involving \\(c\\) in a way that affects the exponent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expression. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me approach it differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would mean that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some combination of terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times the entire expansion, which doesn't make sense because we're looking for a coefficient, not an expression. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and it's multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me verify. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nBut wait, another thought: perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which includes all possible powers of \\(c\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would actually be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, so 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. Then, when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the other expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the sum of the coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which is 2^6 = 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's 6 times the entire expansion, but that would make the coefficient 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that the other part can have any power of \\(c\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me try a different approach. Let me compute the product step by step.\n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) as we did before, which gives us terms up to \\(a^4b^4\\), but we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), which has a coefficient of 6.\n\nNow, the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well:\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nSo, the expansion has terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\) in steps of 2. The coefficients are the binomial coefficients: 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1.\n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion contributes to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nBut wait, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems correct. So, the coefficient is 384. But let me check with a smaller example to make sure. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we have \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product would be 1 (from \\(a^2\\)) times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\), which is 2, so 1*2=2. But wait, actually, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't exist because the first expansion only goes up to \\(a^2b^0\\) and \\(a^0b^2\\), so when multiplied by the second expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would require multiplying \\(a^2b^0\\) by \\(a^0b^2\\), but that's not possible because the second expansion doesn't have \\(b\\). Wait, so maybe my earlier reasoning is flawed.\n\nWait, in the original problem, the second expansion only has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so it doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Therefore, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the variables are separate. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion multiplied by each term from the second expansion, which are all in terms of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be the coefficient from the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut in my small example, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be zero because there's no \\(b\\) in the second expansion to create a \\(b^2\\) term when multiplied by \\(a^2\\). Wait, but that contradicts my earlier reasoning. So, perhaps my earlier reasoning is wrong.\n\nWait, in the small example, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). When multiplied by \\((c + 1/c)\\), the product is \\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\). So, the terms are \\(a^2c\\), \\(a^2/c\\), \\(2a b c\\), \\(2a b /c\\), \\(b^2 c\\), \\(b^2 /c\\). There is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term because the variables are separate. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero. But according to my earlier reasoning, it should be 1 (coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in first expansion, which is actually zero) times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 2. But since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is zero, the result is zero, which matches. So, in that case, my reasoning works.\n\nBut in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is 6, and the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so the coefficient in the product is 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but in the small example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is zero, so the result is zero. So, in the original problem, since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is 6, the result is 6*64=384.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nBut let me check another way. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem specifically asks for \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). Therefore, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have to come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion by the constant term from the second expansion, which is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let's find that.\n\nIn the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so:\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\nSo, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first expansion (6) times the constant term from the second expansion (20), so 6*20=120.\n\nWait, that contradicts my earlier conclusion of 384. So, which one is correct?\n\nIn the small example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because there's no \\(b\\) in the second expansion. But in the original problem, the second expansion only has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so to get a term like \\(a^2b^2\\), you have to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion by a term from the second expansion that doesn't involve \\(c\\), i.e., the constant term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120.\n\nBut earlier, I thought it was 384, which was based on multiplying by the sum of all coefficients, but that seems incorrect because the sum of all coefficients would include terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which would create terms like \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), but not \\(a^2b^2\\) alone. Therefore, the correct approach is to find the constant term in the second expansion and multiply it by the coefficient from the first expansion.\n\nSo, in the small example, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because the second expansion doesn't have a constant term unless we have a term like \\(b^2c^0\\), but in the first expansion, the constant term in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is \\(b^2\\), but that's multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so it doesn't give \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion (6) and the constant term in the second expansion (20), so 6*20=120.\n\nTherefore, my initial reasoning was wrong because I considered the sum of all coefficients, but in reality, only the constant term in the second expansion contributes to the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, as the other terms would introduce powers of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), making the term not just \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, to clarify, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But according to the method, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is zero, so the product would be zero, which is correct.\n\nAnother example: \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). The first expansion is \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). The second expansion is \\(c^2 + 2c*(1/c) + (1/c)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). The constant term in the second expansion is 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion (which is zero) times 2, so zero. But actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^2\\) by \\((c + 1/c)^2\\), the product is \\(a^2c^2 + a^2*(1/c^2) + 2ab c^2 + 2ab*(1/c^2) + b^2c^2 + b^2*(1/c^2)\\). There is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term because the variables are separate. So, the coefficient is indeed zero, which matches the calculation.\n\nTherefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, so my initial reasoning was incorrect because I thought that the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion would contribute, but actually, only the constant term in the second expansion contributes to the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the correct coefficient is 120.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and find the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero). That term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. Multiply these two coefficients: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by multiplying the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) with the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n2. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3.

    "text": " Let me think about the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). If I expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. I'm specifically interested in the term where the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so that's \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the expansion, that would correspond to \\(k = 2\\). Let me calculate the coefficient for that term. The binomial coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). I remember that \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} = \\dfrac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\\). So, plugging in the numbers, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the term \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), when I multiply the two expansions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). However, since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that the part involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) can be considered separately. That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that right? Hmm, no, maybe not exactly. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then in the product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part by every term in the second part. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, but is that correct? Let me think again. \n\nActually, no. Because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all possible terms where the product of the terms from the two expansions results in \\(a^2b^2\\). But since the second expansion only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are separate variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) won't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression should be 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check to make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can approach it differently. Let me expand both expressions separately and then consider the product. Starting with \\((a + b)^4\\), as I did before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), let's use the binomial theorem as well. The expansion will be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponents of \\(c\\) will be \\(6 - 2m\\) where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. Now, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Since we're interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we only need to consider the term in the first expansion that is \\(6a^2b^2\\) and multiply it by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought earlier.\n\nWait, but maybe I should confirm this another way. Let me think about the entire product. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then in the product, this term will be \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as the product of two polynomials. The first polynomial is \\(P(a, b) = (a + b)^4\\), and the second is \\(Q(c) = \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\) are polynomials in different variables, when you multiply them, the coefficients of the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are unaffected by the coefficients involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\) is simply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but is there another way to think about this? Maybe not necessary, but just to make sure. Let me consider the entire expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's being multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion, but when you add them all up, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nI think that's solid. So, the coefficient is 384. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, the final answer should be 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe are interested in the term where the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient for this term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nThe sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n\\[\n\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\nSince the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we have:\n\\[\n6 \\times 64 = 384\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means I need to find the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is also squared. Let me write that down.\n\nIn \\((a + b)^4\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so that means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I have this multiplied by the first part. But wait, the question is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient is just 6 multiplied by whatever is the coefficient from the second part when it's multiplied by 1? Wait, no, because the second part is raised to the 6th power, so it's going to have multiple terms. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the second part needs to contribute a term that is 1, so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains as \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think about that.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms in the expansion will be products of terms from each part. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would mean that the term from the second part must also be 1, so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it doesn't introduce any \\(c\\) terms. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(c^0 = 1\\).\n\nSo, let me apply the binomial theorem to \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, it becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) (which is 1) comes from the second part with coefficient 20. So, when we multiply these together, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) has a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a term \\(c^0\\) with coefficient 20. So, when multiplied together, the term is \\(6 \\times 20 \\times a^2b^2c^0\\), which is \\(120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nI think that's it. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Because the exponent of \\(b\\) is \\(k\\), so if \\(k = 2\\), then the exponent of \\(a\\) would be \\(4 - 2 = 2\\). So, the coefficient for that term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).

So, does that mean I need to consider the expansion of both parts and then multiply them together? Hmm, I'm not entirely sure, but I think so. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to worry about the other terms in the expansion involving \\(c\\). Let me think. \n\nIf I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the first part, and it's multiplied by all the terms in the second part. However, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because the problem isn't specifying anything about them. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, regardless of what happens with the \\(c\\) terms. \n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check. The expression is a product of two expansions: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all different variables, their exponents don't interfere with each other. So, when I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just the coefficient from the first part, and the second part's terms will affect the overall expression but not the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nBut wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product, so each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like it would result in a polynomial where each term has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, if I collect all the terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\), their coefficients would each be multiplied by the corresponding coefficients from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right either because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the first expansion's \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which has coefficients that add up to something. \n\nWait, let me think again. The sum of the coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me check that reasoning again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and when you multiply by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion will be multiplied by 6. So, the total contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Since the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64, then yes, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of the two expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the rest of the terms involve \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then maybe it's just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient is a number, not a polynomial. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the entire expansion, every term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by some term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. \n\nWait, but that seems correct because each term in the first expansion's \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which has a coefficient. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible powers of \\(c\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the other variables. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me think differently. Maybe I can consider that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the rest is multiplied by the other expansion. But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire product. \n\nWait, perhaps another approach. Let's think about the entire expression as a product of two polynomials. The first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all different variables, the only way a term can have \\(a^2b^2\\) is if it comes from the first polynomial. The second polynomial contributes terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nWait, that makes sense. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the first polynomial is multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1/1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, let me verify this with a smaller example to make sure I'm not making a mistake. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Let's compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\), which is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in this case. In the first expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{2}{0} = 1\\). The sum of coefficients in the second expansion is \\((1 + 1)^1 = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product should be 1 * 2 = 2. Let's compute the product: \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\). So, the product is \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). When we expand this, the terms are \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is indeed 1 times \\(c + 1/c\\), which would be 1 * (1 + 1) = 2 when considering the sum of coefficients. So, that checks out. \n\nSimilarly, if I take \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is \\((1 + 1)^2 = 4\\). So, 1 * 4 = 4. Let's compute the product: \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). The product is \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be \\(a^2c^2 + 2a^2 + a^2/c^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 2, but wait, that's not 4. Hmm, that contradicts my earlier conclusion. \n\nWait, no, actually, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product is \\(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\), which when considering the entire product, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product is indeed \\(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\), which when considering all terms, the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. But if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then perhaps the coefficient is the sum of the coefficients of \\(a^2\\) across all terms, which would be the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 4. \n\nWait, but in reality, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product is \\(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\), which is a polynomial, not a single number. So, maybe the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we're looking for all terms where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but in the example I just did, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the product would be \\(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). But if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\), it's that polynomial. But the original problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the product would be multiplied by terms from the second expansion. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any integer \\(k\\), and then summing those coefficients. But that seems a bit odd. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that's not what the problem is asking; it's asking for the coefficient, which is usually a number. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me go back to the original problem. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, they're asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in the product, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first expansion, and it's multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion. \n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that's not standard. Normally, the coefficient of a monomial in a product of polynomials is the product of the coefficients, but here, since the monomials involve different variables, the only way a term can have \\(a^2b^2\\) is if it's multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nWait, let me check with a smaller example again. Let's say \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the product should be 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 2. Indeed, when we expand, we get \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2ab + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), but if we're considering the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's the sum of the coefficients, which is 2. So, that seems to check out. \n\nSimilarly, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of the two expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let's consider the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, and it's multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). \n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, in that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, specifically where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. \n\nSo, to clarify, the problem might actually be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial, which isn't standard. \n\nIf that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we calculated earlier. \n\nNext, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find this, we can use the binomial theorem again. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the problem might actually be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nBut let me make sure. The original problem says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a number. Therefore, it's more likely that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would be a polynomial. But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is typically a number. \n\nGiven that, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), so the answer would be 120. \n\nWait, but let me confirm with another approach. Let's consider that the entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). We can write this as a product of two independent expansions. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nYes, that seems correct. Therefore, the answer should be 120. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but that was when I considered the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, leading to 6 * 64 = 384. But that would be the case if we were considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), which would mean summing over all possible exponents of \\(c\\). But in reality, the problem is probably asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nSo, to clarify, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, without any restriction on \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is not a number. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 120. \n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's expecting the coefficient as a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unusual. Typically, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a term in a product of polynomials, it's referring to the coefficient when considering all variables, but in this case, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which usually implies a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that we're summing over all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that would make the coefficient a sum of products, which is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut in that case, the coefficient would be 384, and the term would be \\(384a^2b^2\\), but that seems incorrect because the second expansion isn't a constant; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial, not a number. \n\nTherefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nWait, to confirm, let's consider that in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut in that case, the coefficient is a number, 384, and the term would be \\(384a^2b^2\\), which is a term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power, but that's not necessarily the case. Wait, no, because each term in the product is \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\) is indeed 384. \n\nBut that seems conflicting with my earlier thought that the coefficient would be a polynomial. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the terms. If we're considering the entire product, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which has coefficients. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all those products, which is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nSo, I think that's the correct approach. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. So, which is it? \n\nI think the confusion arises from whether the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384, or the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nGiven that the problem says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\), it's ambiguous. However, in standard problems, when they ask for the coefficient of a term in a product involving multiple variables, they usually mean the coefficient when considering all possible exponents of the other variables. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Let me think of another way. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the product becomes \\((a + b)^4 * 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if I set \\(c = 1\\), I'm essentially summing all coefficients in the second expansion, which gives me the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product as 384. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384. \n\nWait, but in my earlier smaller example, when I set \\(c = 1\\), I get the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which when multiplied by the coefficient in the first expansion gives the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, that seems to confirm that the answer is 384. \n\nTherefore, after all this thinking, I believe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

So, the coefficient is 6. But wait, the problem is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the expansion of both parts and then find the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe it's just 6 times whatever the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is. Wait, no, that might not be right. Let me think again.\n\nWait, actually, the expression is a product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply them together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can think of it as the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), it would actually just be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because any term in the second expansion would be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), but since we're only interested in the term that doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, perhaps we need to find the term in the second expansion that is a constant term, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term from the second expansion, if that term is \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), then unless \\(k=0\\), it will introduce a \\(c\\) term, which we don't want. So, the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is when we multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nTo find the constant term, I can use the binomial theorem again. Let me write that expansion:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the exponent to be zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\).\n\nSo, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\):\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20 \\times 1 = 20\n\\]\n\nSo, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when we multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by this constant term, we get \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2 = 120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(6a^2b^2\\), and the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives a constant term of 20. So, when we multiply these two parts together, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) gets multiplied by 20, resulting in \\(120a^2b^2\\). So, yes, the coefficient is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire product being \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 20, which is 120. That makes sense.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I'm not making a mistake, let me check another way. Suppose I consider the entire expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already know has a coefficient of 6. Now, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), any term that's multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) would contribute to the overall coefficient. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), the only way it can contribute is if we multiply it by a term that's a constant, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if I had to compute the entire expansion, I would have to consider all possible products, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's only affected by the constant term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe seek the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). The constant term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nMultiplying the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we get:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Let me think about the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). If I expand this, the general term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\), right? So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would correspond to the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. So, in the expansion, that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, this also looks like a binomial expression, so I can use the binomial theorem here as well. The expansion would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Let me simplify that term. So, \\(\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = c^{-m}\\), so the term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, perhaps the second part doesn't affect the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when we multiply the two expressions together, \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion would be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, which are all in terms of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe we don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms because they don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just looking for the coefficient when considering the entire expression, but I think it's more likely that it's considering \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe the coefficient is just 6, as we found from the first part, and the second part's expansion doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term because it's multiplied by terms in \\(c\\). But wait, that seems a bit off because the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so maybe the entire expression is a product, and perhaps the \\(c\\) terms could interact with the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms? But no, \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, so their exponents don't interfere. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a numerical value, not an expression in \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all the terms. But that would mean that the entire expression is a product of two expansions, so each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term from the second part, which are all in terms of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion. But that doesn't seem right either because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term, so perhaps it's only the coefficient from the first part, and the second part is just a constant factor. Wait, but \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is not a constant; it's a sum of terms in \\(c\\). So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some term in \\(c\\). But the problem doesn't specify any particular term in \\(c\\); it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, this is a bit confusing.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable and is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, is a sum of terms, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the second part's expansion doesn't affect that term. Therefore, the coefficient is just 6. But that seems too straightforward, so maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait another thought: perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that we're considering the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, in that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\) in the entire expansion. So, that would require us to consider both parts together. Let me try that approach.\n\nSo, first, from \\((a + b)^4\\), as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because we want the overall exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0 when multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(c^0\\) occurs is when \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient from the second part is 20. Therefore, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120. But let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 is when \\(m = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, when we multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, giving a total coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem was just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the answer would be 6, but since the problem includes \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient when considering all variables, possibly looking for the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. Therefore, the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, perhaps the answer is just 6, because in the product, each term is a combination of terms from both expansions. So, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression. Therefore, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps it's considering the entire expression as a product, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have coefficients multiplied by all the terms from the second expansion. But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is miswritten, or maybe I'm misinterpreting it. Alternatively, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would make sense, as in the combined term where \\(c\\) cancels out. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 120, as I calculated earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion. But the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so that would be \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the answer is just 6, because in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term of the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression. Therefore, I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient when considering the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\), so that the term is \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written as a product, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in the first part, and the second part is just a separate expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the second part is just a separate part of the expression. But that seems unlikely because the problem says \"in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\", which is a single product.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of the entire expression as a product, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in the first part, and in the second part, it's just multiplied by each term, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire second expansion. But that can't be, because the coefficient should be a single number, not an expression. So, perhaps the problem is only considering the part with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part is irrelevant. But that seems odd.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would include all possible terms from the product. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term from the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. So, in that case, the answer would be 6. But I'm confused because the problem includes both \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so I'm not sure if it's asking for the coefficient considering both parts or just the first part.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written as a product, so when you expand the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a separate factor that doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written as a product, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, so the coefficient is 6, and the second part is just a separate expression that doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, in that case, the coefficient is just 6. But then why include the second part? It seems odd.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6, and the rest is just part of the expression. So, in that case, the answer would be 6. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120, as I calculated earlier.\n\nWait, let me try to think differently. Let's consider the entire expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Each term in this expansion is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by each term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion would actually be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that can't be, because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120, as I thought earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a separate term that doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) coefficient. So, the answer would be 6. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I can think of it this way: when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which are all in terms of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a separate factor that doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the answer is 6.\n\nWait, but that seems too simple, and the problem includes both parts. So, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible terms, which would require considering the product of the two expansions. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 384\\). But that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me think about the entire expression as a product of two separate expansions. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) expands to terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to terms involving \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, which are all in terms of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a separate factor that doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the answer is 6.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because the problem includes both parts. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would involve multiplying the coefficients from both parts. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 384\\). But that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120. That seems more reasonable.\n\nWait, let me confirm. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, if we're considering the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be combined with any term from the second expansion, which is in terms of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then the answer is 120, as I calculated earlier. So, perhaps the problem is asking for that. Let me think again: in the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term from the second expansion, which has different powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually 6 times the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would typically mean the coefficient when considering all variables. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. In that case, the coefficient would be 6, as that's the coefficient from the first part, and the second part is just a separate factor. But that seems too simple, and I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of it as a generating function. So, the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be, because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a separate factor that doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the answer is 6.\n\nWait, but that seems inconsistent with the problem including both parts. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible terms, which would require multiplying the coefficients from both parts. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, from the first part, it's 6, and from the second part, it's the sum of all coefficients, which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a separate factor that doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the answer is 6.\n\nWait, but then why include the second part in the problem? It seems odd. Maybe the problem is testing whether I consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of the entire product, which would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion. So, that would be 6 * (sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)). The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, in this case, setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, that seems plausible. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384. But I'm not entirely sure if that's what the problem is asking for because the problem didn't specify anything about the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe it's just 6.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. So, in that case, the answer is 6.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to approach this systematically.\n\nFirst, the problem is: Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, the expression is a product of two binomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\).\n\nWhen you expand the product, each term will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion.\n\nSo, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, and it is multiplied by each term from the second expansion.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nBecause when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) times the sum of the coefficients in the second part.\n\nThe sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. But now, I'm thinking that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 384.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 384.\n\nBut let me confirm this with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion would be \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would also be 2. But in reality, the expansion is \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\), so the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are each 2, which is consistent with 1 * 2 = 2.\n\nSimilarly, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 120 when considering \\(c^0\\). So, which one is correct?\n\nI think the confusion arises from whether the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms or specifically when \\(c^0\\) is present.\n\nIf the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 384. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120.\n\nBut the problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\"\n\nSo, it's a bit ambiguous, but I think the intended interpretation is that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, but that seems less likely because the problem includes both parts.\n\nWait, let me check another example to confirm.\n\nSuppose we have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion is \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 0 because there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the expansion. But wait, that's not correct because in the expansion, the terms are \\(a^2c\\), \\(a^2/c\\), \\(2abc\\), \\(2ab/c\\), \\(b^2c\\), and \\(b^2/c\\). So, there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the coefficient is 0.\n\nWait, but according to the earlier logic, the coefficient would be 2 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), so 2 * 2 = 4. But that's not correct because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, that suggests that my earlier logic is flawed.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in that example. Let me think again.\n\nIn \\((a + b)^2\\), the terms are \\(a^2\\), \\(2ab\\), and \\(b^2\\). When multiplied by \\((c + 1/c)\\), each term is multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the resulting terms are:\n\n- \\(a^2c\\)\n- \\(a^2/c\\)\n- \\(2abc\\)\n- \\(2ab/c\\)\n- \\(b^2c\\)\n- \\(b^2/c\\)\n\nSo, indeed, there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 0, which contradicts the earlier logic that it would be 2 * 2 = 4. Therefore, my earlier approach is incorrect.\n\nSo, what's wrong with the earlier logic? It seems that when the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are such that their product can't combine with the \\(c\\) terms to form \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient is 0. So, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only be formed if there's a term in the second expansion that is a constant, i.e., \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion.\n\nIn the earlier example, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\) is 0, because the expansion is \\(c + 1/c\\), which has no constant term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 0, which matches the actual expansion.\n\nSimilarly, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20, giving 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 120.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, in the earlier example, since there was no \\(c^0\\) term, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) was 0. In our problem, since there is a \\(c^0\\) term, the coefficient is 120.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion, which is 6, and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120.\n\nSo, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

If I expand that, I should get terms involving \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\), each multiplied by their respective coefficients.\n\nLet me write out the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial coefficients for the 4th power, which are 1, 4, 6, 4, 1, the expansion would be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nOkay, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) here is 6. But wait, that's just the first part of the problem. The entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how that affects the coefficient.\n\nWait, but the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), right? So, maybe I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). Or does it? Hmm, no, actually, I think I might be misunderstanding. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so when we multiply them together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe we can treat the \\(c\\) terms separately.\n\nWait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we'll have to consider how that affects the coefficient. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a numerical value, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but perhaps we're supposed to consider the entire product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Or maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some term in \\(c\\), but I'm not sure. Let me read the problem again.\n\nThe problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, I think it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, when you expand the entire expression, what is the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what the \\(c\\) part is. So, in other words, we can treat the \\(c\\) terms as separate factors and just consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a single number, not a sum of terms.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but the problem doesn't specify. Alternatively, maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a number.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when we multiply by any term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not correct because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when multiplied by 6, would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nBut that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, that seems plausible. Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nAnd since the sum of the coefficients is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check that. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) being 6, and since it's multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient would be 6 times each term in that expansion. But if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then perhaps it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some specific power of \\(c\\), but since it's not specified, I think the intended answer is 384.\n\nWait, let me try another approach. Let me expand both parts separately and see how they multiply.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nSecond, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that using the binomial theorem:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, the expansion would have terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\) in steps of 2. The coefficients are the binomial coefficients: 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1 for \\(k=0\\) to \\(k=6\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., up to \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\).\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the product, but it's multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), that is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when the power of \\(c\\) is zero. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number.\n\nSo, if that's the case, then we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0, respectively. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, what's the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)? Let's see. From the expansion, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so:\n\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but considering only the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense. So, the answer should be 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but that was when I considered the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, and then multiplied by 6. But that would give the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all powers of \\(c\\), which is not what the problem is asking for. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient when \\(c\\) is at power zero, so 120.\n\nWait, let me check that again. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that would mean the coefficient includes all powers of \\(c\\), which isn't possible because \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\). Therefore, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But when we talk about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we usually mean the coefficient when considering all variables. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^{10}\\) or something else, but as it is, I think the intended answer is 120.\n\nWait, let me try to confirm. Let me think of the entire expansion as a product of two polynomials. Each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial, because each term \\(6a^2b^2c^{2k}\\) contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(c^{-2k}\\), but that's not the case. Wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, that seems contradictory to my earlier thought. Let me clarify. When you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 6, and so on. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as a standalone term (without any \\(c\\)) would be zero because there's no \\(c^0\\) term in \\(6a^2b^2\\). But that can't be right because when you multiply by the \\(c\\) terms, you get terms with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\), but not \\(a^2b^2\\) alone.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's part of a larger term. But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times each coefficient from the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 6, etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), which would make the coefficient a sum of terms, but that doesn't make sense because coefficients are scalars, not polynomials.\n\nI think I'm getting confused here. Let me try a different approach. Let me consider the entire expression as a product of two polynomials and think about how the terms combine. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. When we multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 6, and so on, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) alone (without any \\(c\\)) is zero because there's no such term.\n\nBut that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As I calculated earlier, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nThat makes sense because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by the term with \\(c^0\\), which is 20, you get \\(120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering only the \\(c^0\\) term, is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = 64\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that would be the coefficient if we're considering all powers of \\(c\\), which isn't the case. So, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, I think the intended answer is 120.\n\nWait, let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). In the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second polynomial, because each term \\(a^2b^2c^{2k}\\) has a coefficient of 6 times the coefficient from the second polynomial. Wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the product has different powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) alone (without any \\(c\\)) is zero. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nYes, I think that's the correct approach. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion is 6.\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each expansion:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Let's start by expanding \\((a + b)^4\\). \n\nUsing the binomial theorem, \\((a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Calculating the coefficients, that would be \\(1a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion is 6. \n\nBut wait, the problem isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire expression. Hmm, but the question is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so maybe the part of the expression involving \\(c\\) doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think about that. \n\nWhen I multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can find the coefficient in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the entire second part, since every term in the second part will just add more factors, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient from the first part is just multiplied by the entire second expression. \n\nWait, no, that doesn't sound right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients combine in a certain way. So, maybe I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, not an expression. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when we multiply by the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will just be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would give me an expression, not a single coefficient. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the entire product, any term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But that would mean the coefficient is actually a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem just asks for the coefficient, so maybe it's expecting a numerical coefficient, which would mean that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, that makes sense. Because if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider the term in the expansion where the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out, so that the coefficient is a constant. So, I should find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Then, multiply that by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, let's work on finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. \n\nSo, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. \n\nWait, let me check that again. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So when we multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, giving a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by taking the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiplying it by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The coefficient from the first part is 6, and the constant term from the second part is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Wait, but the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that mean I need to consider the expansion of both parts and then multiply them together? Hmm, maybe not exactly, because I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), is multiplied by it. So, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider that the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but that doesn't sound right because the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which will have terms with different powers of \\(c\\). But since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, no, that's not quite accurate. Because each term in the product will be a term from the first expansion multiplied by a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion, when multiplied by each term in the second expansion, will give terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(6a^2b^2c^{-(6 - k)}\\) or something like that. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), every term in the second expansion will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a term is the product of the coefficients of the terms whose variables multiply to form that term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term in the second expansion, regardless of its \\(c\\) power, when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, indeed, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two polynomials: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the second polynomial has a sum of coefficients equal to 64, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that each term in the product is formed by taking a term from the first polynomial and a term from the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, each of which has a coefficient. Therefore, the total contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then, since the second polynomial is multiplied by it, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients from the second part. \n\nWait, but let me confirm this approach. Let me consider a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion of \\((a + b)^2\\) is \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). The expansion of \\((c + 1/c)\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\). Now, if I multiply these together, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product would be 1 times (1 + 1) = 2, because each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2 times (1 + 1) = 4, and the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) would be 1 times 2 = 2. So, in this case, the coefficients in the product are the coefficients from the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nSo, applying that to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, so the coefficient in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the product being \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct. Because when you have two independent variables, the coefficient of a term involving only those variables is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, for example, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\((c + d)^6\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^3d^3\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). But in our case, since the second polynomial is in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are not variables but rather terms, perhaps the approach is similar. \n\nWait, but in our problem, we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, every term in the second expansion will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion. Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nSo, to compute the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I can set \\(c = 1\\), as I thought earlier, which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of coefficients is 64. \n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me consider another approach. Maybe I can expand both parts separately and then look for the coefficient. \n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) as before, which gives \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nNow, expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, this is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nSo, the expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\).\n\nNow, the sum of the coefficients in this expansion is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64\\), which matches what I found earlier.\n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), and \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). \n\nBut since the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the sum of all these contributions. However, each of these terms has a coefficient of 6 multiplied by the coefficient from the second expansion. Wait, no, that's not quite right. \n\nWait, no, actually, each term in the second expansion has its own coefficient. For example, the term \\(c^6\\) has a coefficient of 1, \\(c^4\\) has 6, \\(c^2\\) has 15, the constant term has 20, \\(c^{-2}\\) has 15, \\(c^{-4}\\) has 6, and \\(c^{-6}\\) has 1. \n\nSo, when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, the coefficients become:\n\n- \\(6 \\times 1 = 6\\) for \\(a^2b^2c^6\\),\n- \\(6 \\times 6 = 36\\) for \\(a^2b^2c^4\\),\n- \\(6 \\times 15 = 90\\) for \\(a^2b^2c^2\\),\n- \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\),\n- \\(6 \\times 15 = 90\\) for \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\),\n- \\(6 \\times 6 = 36\\) for \\(a^2b^2c^{-4}\\),\n- \\(6 \\times 1 = 6\\) for \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\).\n\nNow, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself has a coefficient of 120, and all the other terms have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). But wait, no, that's not correct because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each product is a separate term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first multiplication where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, which is when \\(k = 3\\), because in the second expansion, the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). \n\nWait, that's a different approach. So, perhaps I was wrong earlier. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is not 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, but rather 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, because only that term will result in a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and \\(c^0\\). \n\nWait, that makes more sense because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by \\(20c^0\\), you get \\(120a^2b^2\\). All other terms would have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), which would make them \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k \\neq 0\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\)'s power. Wait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would include all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but that can't be right because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the product, and it's being multiplied by terms that have \\(c\\) in them. So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only appear once in the product, specifically when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by the constant term \\(20c^0\\) in the second expansion. \n\nWait, no, that's not correct either. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion can be multiplied by any term in the second expansion, including those with \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), etc. So, the term \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) would have a coefficient of 6, \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) would have 36, \\(a^2b^2c^2\\) would have 90, \\(a^2b^2\\) would have 120, \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\) would have 90, \\(a^2b^2c^{-4}\\) would have 36, and \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\) would have 6. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, but the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, that term is \\(120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120. \n\nWait, so I think I made a mistake earlier by thinking that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Actually, it's only 6 times the coefficient of the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120. \n\nLet me double-check this. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from multiplying the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion by the term \\(20c^0\\) in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nYes, that makes sense because all other terms would have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), so they wouldn't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) alone. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which gave me 384, but that was incorrect because I misunderstood the problem. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that \\(c\\) must be raised to the zero power, i.e., only the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. \n\nSo, to clarify, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is formed only when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion by the constant term \\(20c^0\\) from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nLet me confirm this with another approach. Let's consider the entire product. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the earlier approach where I thought it was 6 times the sum of all coefficients was wrong because I misinterpreted the problem as looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\)'s exponent, but actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) must be accompanied by \\(c^0\\), so only the constant term in the second expansion contributes to it. \n\nTherefore, the correct coefficient is 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure again. Let me compute the product step by step. \n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) as \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nNext, expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) as \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first will multiply each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will multiply each term in the second expansion:\n\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times c^6 = 6a^2b^2c^6\\),\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 6c^4 = 36a^2b^2c^4\\),\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 15c^2 = 90a^2b^2c^2\\),\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 120a^2b^2\\),\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 15c^{-2} = 90a^2b^2c^{-2}\\),\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 6c^{-4} = 36a^2b^2c^{-4}\\),\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times c^{-6} = 6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\).\n\nSo, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) appears only once, multiplied by 20, giving \\(120a^2b^2\\). All other terms have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), so they don't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) alone. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120. \n\nI think I confused myself earlier by considering the sum of all coefficients, but that would give the total coefficient if we were considering the product without any specific terms involving \\(c\\). But in reality, since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\) with any power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. But wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power, so only the term where \\(k = 0\\) contributes, which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nYes, that's consistent with the earlier calculation. So, the correct coefficient is 120. \n\nI think I got confused earlier because I misapplied the concept of combining coefficients from both expansions. It's important to remember that when looking for a specific term in the product, you have to consider only the combinations of terms from each expansion that result in that specific term. In this case, only the term from the first expansion that gives \\(a^2b^2\\) and the term from the second expansion that gives \\(c^0\\) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, to summarize, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think that's the correct answer now. I just need to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me verify the binomial coefficients again. \n\nFor \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), which is correct.\n\nFor \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), because \\(c^{6 - 3} \\times (1/c)^3 = c^3 \\times c^{-3} = c^0\\). So, that's correct as well.\n\nTherefore, multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nYes, I'm confident now that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the expansion of each part separately. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)** using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)** using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) is 20.\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients** from each expansion where the variables align to form \\(a^2b^2\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Since the expression is \\((a + b)^4\\), I can expand it and find the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me write that out.\n\nFor \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion will have terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\). The general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me calculate that coefficient.\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Okay, that seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder if I need to expand this as well. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the second part, the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) won't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). That means, when I multiply the two expansions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when I multiply, the \\(c\\) terms won't change the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.\n\nWait, no, actually, when I multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term (if any) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if I take any other term from the second expansion, it will involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would make the product have terms with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), but we just want \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but is that correct? Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then when I expand it, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\). So, the term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, I need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, for \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient from the first part is 6 as before. Now, in the second part, we have \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). But since we want the entire term to be \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means the exponent on \\(c\\) must be zero. So, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient from the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\n\\]\n\nWait, that's not right. Wait, 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 6!/(3!3!) is 720/(6*6) = 720/36 = 20. Yes, that's correct. So, the coefficient from the second part is 20. Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the term we're looking for is when we multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion by the constant term from the second expansion. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which happens when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), as I found. So, the coefficient is indeed \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me think about the entire expansion. When I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). Then, when I multiply each of these by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term will be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the \\(6a^2b^2\\) term multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, as calculated. So, 6 * 20 is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there any other term in the second expansion that could contribute to the constant term? For example, if I had terms with \\(c^1\\) and \\(c^{-1}\\), but when multiplied, they could potentially combine to a constant term? But no, because in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term is either \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), so the only way to get a constant term is when \\(k = 0\\), which is when the exponent is zero. So, the only term contributing to the constant is when \\(m = 3\\), as I found earlier.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but just to double-check, let me compute \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and see what the constant term is. Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nSo, the term where the exponent is zero is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), as before. So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the constant term is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think about another approach. Maybe using multinomial coefficients or something else. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20, so the product is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to multiply the two expansions, I would have each term from the first multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion by the constant term in the second expansion, because any other term from the second expansion would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, which would make the term not purely \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but just to make absolutely sure, let me compute both expansions separately and see if that holds.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nNext, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's compute that:\n\n- When m=0: \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1 * c^6\\)\n- m=1: \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^{4} = 6c^4\\)\n- m=2: \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^{2} = 15c^2\\)\n- m=3: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\)\n- m=4: \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- m=5: \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- m=6: \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the constant term is indeed 20. Therefore, when I multiply the two expansions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first is 6, and it's multiplied by 20 from the second expansion, giving 120.\n\nWait, but just to be extra careful, let me think about whether any other terms could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). Suppose I take a term from the first expansion, say \\(a^3b\\) with coefficient 4, and multiply it by a term from the second expansion that has \\(c^{-1}\\), but then the resulting term would be \\(a^3b c^{-1}\\), which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\). Similarly, if I take \\(a^4\\) and multiply by \\(c^{-2}\\), that's \\(a^4c^{-2}\\), which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and multiply it by the constant term from the second expansion. So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about the entire expression as a product of two polynomials and consider how the coefficients multiply. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate variables, the exponents don't interfere with each other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me try to compute a small part of the expansion to see if that holds. For example, let me take the first few terms of each expansion and see how they multiply.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nSecond, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\).\n\nNow, if I multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, \\(6a^2b^2 * c^6 = 6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2 * 6c^4 = 36a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(6a^2b^2 * 15c^2 = 90a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2 * 20 = 120a^2b^2\\), and so on. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with no \\(c\\) comes only from \\(6a^2b^2 * 20\\), which gives 120a^2b^2. So, that's consistent with what I found earlier.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0). This occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\nThus, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."
