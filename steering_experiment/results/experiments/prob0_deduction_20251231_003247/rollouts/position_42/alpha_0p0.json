    "text": " In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs at \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is 20. So, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. I think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me go through it again. So, first, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). Then, expanding \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when the exponent is zero, which happens when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, when you multiply the two expansions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, which comes from the 6a^2b^2 term in the first expansion, and the 20 term in the second expansion, the product is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 120. I don't think I made any mistakes here. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that the entire expression is a product of two independent binomial expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and \\(c^0\\) in the second part. Since \\(c^0\\) is just 1, it doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient remains 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.

So, when we multiply these two polynomials together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by the constant term from the second polynomial, giving \\(a^2b^2 \\times 20\\). But wait, no, actually, it's not exactly that. Because when you multiply the two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. But since we're only interested in the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can think of it as the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial. So, that would indeed be 6 times 20, which is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there a possibility that other terms from the second polynomial could contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term? For example, if I took a term with \\(c^k\\) from the second polynomial and multiplied it by a term with \\(a^2b^2\\), would that somehow still result in a term without \\(c\\)? No, because any term with \\(c^k\\) (where \\(k \\neq 0\\)) would introduce a \\(c\\) term into the product, which would make the term have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that we're looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, only the term where we take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and \\(c^0\\) from the second polynomial contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. So, I think that's the answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any mistakes. First, I expanded \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem and found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) to be 6. Then, I considered the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and found the coefficient of the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which is 20. Multiplying these two coefficients together gives 120.
