It says in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so yes, the entire product. So, yes, I think 120 is the correct coefficient. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations. The binomial coefficients are correct, and the exponents add up properly. So, I think the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem**:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 20.\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients**:\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer**: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

Alternatively, I could consider the entire expansion as a product of two polynomials and focus on how the terms interact. But since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can safely ignore the \\(c\\) terms when looking for that specific term.

    "text": " So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. I think that makes sense. Let me just make sure I didn't miss anything. Another way to think about it is that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials. The first polynomial has terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and the constant term from the second polynomial. So, yes, that means the coefficient is the product of the two coefficients, which is 6 times 20, which is 120. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations.
