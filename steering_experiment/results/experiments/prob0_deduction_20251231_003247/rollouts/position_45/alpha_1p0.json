Wait, but I should make sure that there are no other terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that could contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term when multiplied by terms from \\((a + b)^4\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that has a non-zero power of \\(c\\) would result in a term that includes \\(c\\), which isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\).

Since \\((a + b)^4\\) only has terms up to \\(a^4b^0\\) and down to \\(a^0b^4\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) only has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), there's no overlap in the variables. So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and the \\(c^0\\) term from the second. Therefore, there are no other contributions to \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 120. Alternatively, maybe I should think about the entire expansion. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I were to write this out, it would be the product of two polynomials. Each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a term in \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term is a product of a term from the first polynomial and a term from the second. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial by the constant term in the second polynomial. Because any other term in the second polynomial would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would make the product have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), but we're only interested in the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) and no \\(c\\) terms. So, that would be the product of the coefficients from each part, as I thought earlier. Therefore, 6 times 20 is 120. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6, that's correct. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20, that's correct too. So, 6 times 20 is 120, so that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product of two separate expansions. So, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply term by term. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^5 \\times (1/c) + 15c^4 \\times (1/c)^2 + 20c^3 \\times (1/c)^3 + 15c^2 \\times (1/c)^4 + 6c \\times (1/c)^5 + (1/c)^6\\). Simplifying the second expansion, we get \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). So, the constant term is 20, as I found earlier. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will only be multiplied by the constant term 20, giving \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2 = 120a^2b^2\\). So, that's consistent with my earlier conclusion.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me make sure that there isn't any other term that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). For example, suppose I take a term with \\(a^3b\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by a term with \\(1/c\\) from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), would that somehow give me \\(a^2b^2\\)? No, because that would give me \\(a^3b \\times 1/c = a^3b/c\\), which is not \\(a^2b^2\\). Similarly, taking \\(ab^3\\) from the first polynomial and multiplying by \\(c\\) from the second would give \\(ab^3c\\), which is not \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by the constant term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product and consider how the terms interact. So, the first polynomial has terms up to \\(a^4\\) and \\(b^4\\), and the second has terms up to \\(c^6\\) and down to \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), because any other term in the second polynomial would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) term, which would make the product have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which we don't want. Therefore, the coefficient is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, let me just check if I considered all possible terms. For instance, could a term like \\(a^2b^2c\\) come from some other combination? Well, no, because \\(a^2b^2c\\) is not the same as \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the term where the \\(c\\) exponent is zero would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, 120 is the correct coefficient.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the entire expression as a product of two independent binomial expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Since these are independent, their product is 6*20=120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute the entire expansion and see. Although that might take some time, let me try.\n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\):\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nNow, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^5 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c} + 15c^4 \\cdot \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^2 + 20c^3 \\cdot \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^3 + 15c^2 \\cdot \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^4 + 6c \\cdot \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^5 + \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\n\\]\n\nSimplify each term:\n\n\\[\nc^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\n\\]\n\nSo, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\nc^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\n\\]\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by this expansion, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion above. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion. But we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, that would be the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term (20). So, that gives \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nJust to make sure, let me think if there's any other term that could result in \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by some \\(c\\) term. For example, could \\(a^3b\\) multiplied by \\(1/c\\) give \\(a^2b^2\\) somehow? No, because that would result in \\(a^3b \\times 1/c = a^3b/c\\), which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\). Similarly, \\(ab^3\\) multiplied by \\(c\\) would give \\(ab^3c\\), which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\). So, there's no way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) from any other combination of terms except \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term. So, that confirms that the coefficient is 120.\n\nAnother way to think about it is using the concept of multinomial coefficients, but in this case, since the variables are separate, it's just the product of the two binomial coefficients. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think I've considered this from multiple angles, and each time, the coefficient comes out to 120. So, I'm confident that the answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\).

So, only the constant term (c^0) would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being a product, so when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is in one polynomial and the other polynomial's terms are in \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) with \\(c^0\\).

So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is being multiplied by all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but only the term with \\(c^0\\) will result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\).

Because in the expansion, each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, any term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that isn't \\(c^0\\) would result in a term that includes \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would mean the entire product would have \\(c\\) in it, so the only term contributing to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is when we take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term and multiply it by the \\(c^0\\) term. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. Hmm, but wait, let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so when you expand it, you have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m \\times (1/c)^{6 - m}\\), but wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).

So, when you multiply this by \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\), the product becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^4 \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\).

So, \\(k = 2\\), and then \\(m\\) must be such that the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because we want the term \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) gives \\(m = 3\\).

So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to expand the entire product, it would be a huge expression, but the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and the constant term from the second part. So, yeah, 120 is correct.\n\nWait, another way to think about it is that the entire expression is the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficients multiply. So, if the first part contributes 6 to \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part contributes 20 to \\(c^0\\), then when you multiply them, the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120 for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that makes sense.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I think the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything else. Are there other terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by terms from \\((a + b)^4\\)? But no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) is to multiply by \\(c^0\\). Any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, which would change the term to something like \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), which aren't the same as \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the constant term from the second polynomial will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, if I have \\( (a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4 \\) and \\( \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^5(1/c) + 15c^4(1/c)^2 + 20c^3(1/c)^3 + 15c^2(1/c)^4 + 6c(1/c)^5 + (1/c)^6 \\). Simplifying the second polynomial: \\( c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6 \\). So, the constant term is 20. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the only way to get an \\(a^2b^2\\) term is to multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by 20, resulting in \\(120a^2b^2\\). So, yes, the coefficient is 120. I think that's correct. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me check if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe by considering the entire expansion and looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\). But that might be more complicated because the second polynomial has multiple terms, but as I thought before, only the constant term will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think 120 is correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when expanding, each term is of the form \\( \\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m} \\). So, for a term to have \\(a^2b^2\\), we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so that's consistent with the first part. Then, for the second part, to not have any \\(c\\) terms, we need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\), as before. So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, that confirms it again.\n\nI think I'm confident now that the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\).
