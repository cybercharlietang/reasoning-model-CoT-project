Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we have \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this case would be zero because the second polynomial doesn't have a \\(c^0\\) term. Wait, no, actually, the second polynomial is \\(c + 1/c\\), so the constant term is zero? Wait, no, the constant term is zero because \\(c + 1/c\\) has \\(c^1\\) and \\(c^{-1}\\), but no \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no constant term to multiply with. But in our original problem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) does have a constant term, which is 20, so the coefficient is 120. So, that makes sense.\n\nWait, another check: Let's compute the product \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and see if the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 120. Alternatively, maybe I can compute the product and look for the term. But that might be time-consuming, but perhaps I can consider specific terms.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials, and when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120, as before.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will only come from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) and the constant term in the second polynomial. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which corresponds to \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) or \\(m = 3\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."
