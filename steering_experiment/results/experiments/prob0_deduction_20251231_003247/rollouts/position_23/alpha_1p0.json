    "text": " Because if we take a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) which is \\(a^2b^2\\) and multiply it by a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), say \\(c^k\\), then the resulting term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would require \\(k = 0\\), so that the \\(c^k\\) term is 1, so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains \\(a^2b^2\\). So, if I can find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, first, let me find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, \\(c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, when I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. And in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(m = 3\\), which is correct, and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as the product of two expansions, and when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's only affected by the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts, and the \\(c\\) terms would just contribute a factor that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is indeed 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), it's just 6 times the constant term of the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 20, so 6*20=120. Yeah, that makes sense.

But if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would mean that the \\(c\\) part must be 1, i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, in other words, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because that's the only term that won't involve \\(c\\). So, when I multiply that by \\(a^2b^2\\), I just get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients from both expansions, which are 6 and 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that.

So, when I multiply these two parts together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part gets multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, resulting in 6 * 20 = 120.

Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything here. So, the problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion and the \\(c^0\\) term in the second expansion. So, yes, that makes sense. The other terms from the second expansion would introduce \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) terms, which would make the overall term have \\(c\\) exponents, so they wouldn't contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). So, my reasoning seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about it as the product of two independent expansions.

That seems right.\n\nWait, but let me check the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) again. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m}\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when does \\(6 - 2m = 0\\)? When \\(m = 3\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\\). So, that's correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is symmetric around \\(c^3\\) and \\(c^{-3}\\). So, the constant term is indeed when \\(m = 3\\), which is 20.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there any possibility that I'm supposed to consider cross terms? Like, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) with a \\(c\\) term, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so any term in the expansion that includes \\(c\\) would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would require the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero. So, only the constant term in the second expansion contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, yes, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the binomial coefficients. So, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\) is correct, and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\) is correct as well. So, 6 * 20 is indeed 120. So, that's the coefficient.\n\nI think that's the answer.

Therefore, to get the term \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion by the constant term (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part.

Now, going back to the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. So, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. So, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives a constant term (c^0) with coefficient 20.

So, yes, that would be 6 * 20 = 120. But wait, let me think again. Is there any other way that \\(a^2b^2\\) could come up? For example, if the second expansion had a term that's a multiple of \\(c^0\\), but I think that's the only term. Because if you take any other term from the second expansion, it would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would make the overall term have a \\(c\\) component, thus not being just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120, and since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), but in reality, the term would be \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\).

So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). How do I find the constant term? Well, again, using the binomial theorem. Let's expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The general term in this expansion would be \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything here. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanding this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find all possible combinations where the product results in \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and the second part must contribute \\(c^0\\), which is the term we found, 20. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. Let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. I think that makes sense. Let me try another approach to confirm. Alternatively, the entire expression is a product of two expansions, and we're interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).

So, each term has an exponent of \\(c\\) equal to \\(6 - 2m\\). To find the constant term, we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the constant term is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the product of the coefficients from each part, right? Because when you multiply two terms, their coefficients multiply. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient from the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, multiplying them together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has a constant term (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) which is 20. So, when we multiply these two expressions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will multiply the constant term 20 from the second part, resulting in \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. But wait, is that the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^{k} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as before. Then, for the \\(c\\) part, it can be any term, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent, we need to sum over all possible \\(m\\) such that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second polynomial, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), where \\(k\\) is the exponent from the second polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). Therefore, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term (i.e., the term where \\(c^0\\)) from the second polynomial. So, indeed, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120. Therefore, I think my initial reasoning was correct. The coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), giving the coefficient:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from each part:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Therefore, the only contribution comes from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term multiplied by the constant term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient is indeed 120. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to be sure. So, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, correct. \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20, correct. 6 * 20 is 120, correct. So, I think that's the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the expansion of each part separately and then identifying the constant term from the second polynomial, which when multiplied by the coefficient from the first polynomial gives the desired coefficient.\n\nStep 1: Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nStep 2: Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) to find the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nStep 3: Multiply the two coefficients together: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nFinal Answer: \\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

    "text": " Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by, say, \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), it would give me \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would require that the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, i.e., \\(k = 0\\). So, in order for \\(a^2b^2\\) to appear as a term in the product, the term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) must be \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me calculate that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the exponent to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, putting it all together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) (which has a coefficient of 6) and the \\(c^0\\) term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) (which has a coefficient of 20). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, is that right? Let me double-check. So, the coefficient from the first part is 6, and the coefficient from the second part is 20, so when you multiply them, it's 6*20=120. That seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Alternatively, maybe I should think about it differently. Let me consider the entire expansion. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as before, giving a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For the \\(c\\) part, we need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), giving a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the combined coefficient is 6*20=120. Yeah, that seems consistent. So, I think the coefficient is 120. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, I'm confident the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem, which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{120}\\)"
