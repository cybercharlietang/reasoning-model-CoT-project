    "text": " Wait, is that right? Let me think. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then each term in the expansion is a product of a term from each part. So, to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by any term from the second part. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because the second part isn't a constant; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe I should consider that since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that would be if I were looking for the constant term in \\(c\\), but I'm not. I'm just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Hmm, that's confusing. Let me try to clarify. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two expressions together, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) is determined by the expansion of the second part. But since we're only interested in terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, that corresponds to \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that correct? Because when you take the product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplies each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because it's not a number. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, that would be the term where in the first part we have \\(a^2b^2\\) and in the second part we have the constant term \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. So, first, let me confirm that. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, it's possible that they mean the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in that case, it's a bit ambiguous. However, in most cases, when asked for the coefficient of a term that doesn't involve another variable, it's implied that you consider all possible powers of the other variables. So, perhaps the coefficient is the product of the coefficients from each part. But that seems not quite right because the second part is a separate variable. Alternatively, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the \\(c\\) expansion. So, to avoid confusion, let me proceed under that assumption because otherwise, the coefficient would involve terms with \\(c\\), which isn't specified. So, I think the correct interpretation is that we need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is actually a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, the more likely scenario is that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in the \\(c\\) expansion, i.e., the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, leaving a constant. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, let's proceed with that.\n\nFirst, as I calculated earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do that, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, that would be 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, it's more likely that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), i.e., the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is written in a way that \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the product, and it's considering that \\(c\\) terms might be present, but the question is only about the \\(a^2b^2\\) part. But that seems unclear. However, given the way the problem is phrased, I think the intended interpretation is that we need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in the \\(c\\) part, which would be 120.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nSo, I think I've arrived at the correct answer. The coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiplying it by each term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) terms, that means we need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) in the second expansion. Because if we multiply by any other term from the second expansion, it would introduce a \\(c\\) term, making the overall term have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), which isn't what we're looking for. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

Let me apply the binomial theorem again. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\cdot c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.

So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me just double-check that I didn't make any mistakes. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me make sure. Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then each term in the expansion would be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Wait, no, actually, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from taking the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and multiplying it by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives 2^6 = 64. So, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me check that. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), so when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and since it's multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which has a sum of coefficients 64, then the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me make sure I'm not missing something. Let's think differently. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from multiplying the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As we said earlier, the sum of coefficients is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if I were to write out the product, it would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), and then multiplied by the sum over all m of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. So, yes, that seems correct. I think I can confidently say that the coefficient is 384.\n\nBut wait, just to double-check, let's consider another approach. Let's compute \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) separately and see how the multiplication works. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded as \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the terms are \\(c^6, 6c^4, 15c^2, 20, 15c^{-2}, 6c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is when we set \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that's consistent with what I found earlier. Therefore, I'm pretty sure the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{384}\\)"

So, I already found that the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to expand that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, it's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). I need the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of 6 and 20, which is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me check the steps again. First, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). Then, the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(m = 3\\), so the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{6 - 2*3} = 20c^0 = 20\\). So, when I multiply these two parts together, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the original problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply them, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second part. That makes sense because any other term from the second part would involve \\(c\\) raised to some power, which would make the term have a \\(c\\) component, but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to multiply by the constant term. So, yeah, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's correct. Let me just verify the binomial coefficients again. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is indeed 6 because 4 choose 2 is 6. \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20 because 6 choose 3 is 20. So, 6 * 20 is 120. I think that's the right answer. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I'm looking for the product of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and any term from the second part. But \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so when multiplied by terms from the second polynomial, it will just have those \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts multiplied by terms in \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that means the coefficient in the entire product expression, but considering all the terms. Wait, no, maybe not. Wait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe it's considering the coefficient as a term that includes the \\(c\\) parts. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that we can treat the second part as a constant when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, that might make sense. So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would include all the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean the coefficient is a sum involving \\(c\\) terms. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the product and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of the second part, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present once, multiplied by the constant term of the second expansion. Wait, that might make sense. Let me think again: If I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, will have terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), 20, 15c^{-2}\\), 6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first will multiply each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will multiply each term from the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would be the entire expansion of the second part multiplied by 6. So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\right)\\). But that seems a bit odd because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, but considering only the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., the constant term. So, the term where \\(c^0\\), which is 20. So, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120. That seems more likely. Let me check that. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term (which is \\(c^0\\)), you get \\(a^2b^2\\), and that's the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. All other terms would have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), so they wouldn't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the sense of just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). Therefore, the constant term is 20. Now, multiplying this by the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, we get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. Multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, if I think about the entire expansion, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. The only term that would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is when it's multiplied by the constant term, which is 20. So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120 is the coefficient.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. I'm assuming that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we're only considering the term where the \\(c\\) exponents cancel out. But maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be a polynomial where each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the products where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think my initial approach was correct: the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but considering only the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, i.e., the constant term. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply together to give that specific term. In this case, the specific term is \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the first polynomial, the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). In the second polynomial, the term that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) is the constant term, which is 20. So, when you multiply these two terms, you get \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120. That makes sense.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me consider the entire product. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives us terms up to \\(a^4\\) and down to \\(b^4\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives us terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\). When we multiply these together, each term in the first will multiply each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first will multiply each term in the second, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(15a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(20a^2b^2\\), \\(15a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), and \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 6*6=36, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^2\\) is 6*15=90, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6*20=120, and so on. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the answer would be 120, because that's the coefficient when the \\(c\\) terms cancel out. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the sum of all those products, but that doesn't make much sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would vary depending on the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering only the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, which is 120. So, I'm confident that the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiplying it by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\n1.

The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. Multiply the two coefficients:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Because if I take any term from the second polynomial that has a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), then the product would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), but the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that the exponent of \\(c\\) must be zero. So, I think I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by the coefficient 6 from the first part. So, let's work on finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\) which means \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That is, 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term from the first expansion multiplies each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20. So, the product is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, but just to be thorough, let me check if there's any other way this could happen. For example, could there be terms from the second expansion that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), result in \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms? But no, because any term from the second expansion that isn't \\(c^0\\) would introduce a \\(c\\) term, which would make the overall term have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or similar, which isn't what we're looking for. So, yes, only the constant term from the second expansion contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. Therefore, I think the answer is 120. Wait, let me just confirm the binomial coefficients again to make sure I didn't miscalculate. For \\((a + b)^4\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), that's correct. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), that's correct too. So, 6 * 20 is indeed 120.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, in other words, when you expand the entire expression, what is the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\).

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

So, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). Now, when I multiply this by \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term from the first expansion, I get \\(6 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems like a lot. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, if I treat \\(c\\) as a variable separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, not an expression. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That would make more sense because then we're looking for a specific term. So, if that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 (from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find that, I can use the binomial theorem again.

So, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the answer should be 120. Wait, that makes more sense. So, I think I was initially confused about whether the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would require considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial. However, since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two, you get 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. Alternatively, if the problem had been asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it would have been 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not specifying anything about \\(c\\), it's ambiguous. However, in standard problems like this, when multiple variables are present, and a specific term is asked for, it usually refers to the term with the same variables, meaning that the exponents of the other variables should be zero. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be accompanied by \\(c^0\\), so the coefficient is 120. Yeah, I think that makes sense. So, the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), which is correct. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is when \\(k = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), which is correct. So, 6 * 20 = 120, which seems right.\n\nAlternatively, if I had to think about the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number, which doesn't make sense for the answer. Therefore, it's more logical that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident that the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Wait, is that right? Let me think again. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, that would mean that the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot 6c^5\\), etc., up to \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot \\text{constant term}\\). But wait, the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). So, does that mean we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\)? Or are we supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\)? Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\). That is, in the entire expansion, collect all terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\), and sum their coefficients. But wait, each term in the product will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents and some \\(c\\) exponent. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot 6c^5\\), etc., but none of these will be just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, in the product, there is no term that is exactly \\(a^2b^2\\) because every term will have some power of \\(c\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero? That can't be right because the problem is asking for it, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, maybe I misinterpreted the question. Perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering only the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is multiplied by all the terms in the second expansion, the coefficient would actually be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial in \\(c\\). Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem didn't specify, so maybe I need to clarify. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. Let me check that interpretation.\n\nSo, if that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Then, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the middle term, which is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which means \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Is the problem asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), or specifically when multiplied by \\(c^0\\)? If it's the former, then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial, but the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient. So, I think the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion, but that doesn't make much sense because the coefficient should be a number. So, I think the intended answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Let's consider the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2 \\times 6c^5\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. So, that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem didn't specify, so maybe I need to assume that it's asking for the coefficient when considering only the term where \\(c^0\\) is present. So, in that case, the coefficient is 120, as calculated earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. So, I think that's the intended answer.\n\nSo, to summarize: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20.

That makes sense because when you multiply, you're combining terms, and the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term and multiply it by the term that cancels out the \\(c\\), which is the constant term. So, first, let me find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here.

So, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to expand that. Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).

Therefore, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there any other term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by something else? Hmm, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first, the only contribution to \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second polynomial. So, yes, the coefficient should be 6 times 20, which is 120. Wait, but let me check again. Let me think about how the product works. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) has terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), etc., each multiplied by the corresponding terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I'm looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), it's only the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in the second polynomial, right? Because any other term in the second polynomial would have a power of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would give \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something, which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the constant term in the second polynomial contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me think again. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply them out, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but only the constant term will result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms in the second expansion will have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) term, so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they'll produce terms like \\(a^2b^2c\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-1}\\), etc., which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, only the constant term in the second expansion contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. Wait, but just to be thorough, let me consider the entire expression. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me denote \\((a + b)^4 = A\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = B\\). Then, the product is \\(A \\times B\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) is 6, as we found. The expansion of \\(B\\) is a sum of terms involving powers of \\(c\\). When you multiply \\(A\\) by \\(B\\), each term in \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\(A\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(B\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), where \\(k\\) is the exponent from \\(B\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, that would only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in \\(B\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's correct. Wait, but let me check if I'm not supposed to consider other terms. For example, is there a possibility that some other combination of terms from \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) could result in \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. Suppose I have a term in \\(A\\) that's \\(a^kb^{4 - k}\\) and a term in \\(B\\) that's \\(c^m\\). Then, when multiplied together, the term would be \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\). For this to equal \\(a^2b^2\\), we need \\(k = 2\\), \\(4 - k = 2\\), which gives \\(k = 2\\), and \\(m = 0\\) because there's no \\(c\\) term. So, yes, only the term where \\(k = 2\\) in \\(A\\) and \\(m = 3\\) in \\(B\\) (since that's the constant term) contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but just to make sure, let me compute \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) again. \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), that's correct. And \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), that's also correct. So, 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Therefore, I think that's the answer.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Suppose I made a mistake in considering the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me verify that. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when m=0, it's \\(c^6\\), m=1, it's \\(c^4\\), m=2, it's \\(c^2\\), m=3, it's \\(c^0\\) which is 1, m=4, it's \\(c^{-2}\\), m=5, \\(c^{-4}\\), m=6, \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the constant term is indeed when m=3, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, that's correct. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, I think the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think if there's another approach. Maybe I can consider the entire expression and look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) directly without separating the two parts. But that might be more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can use generating functions or multinomial coefficients, but in this case, since the expression is a product of two binomials, the approach I took seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any term in the second polynomial. But since the second polynomial doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiplying it by the constant term from the second polynomial. So, that again gives me 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think I've checked it enough times, so I'm confident the answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."
