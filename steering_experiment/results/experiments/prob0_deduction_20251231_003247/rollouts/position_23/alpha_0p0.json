    "text": " Because any other term in the second polynomial would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, which would make the product have \\(c\\) terms, but we're only looking for a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) and no \\(c\\) terms. So, I think I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by the coefficient 6 from the first part. So, let me work on finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes here. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, correct? Yes, because \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 times 20 is 120. That seems right. So, I think the coefficient is 120. Therefore, the answer should be 120.\n\nWait, but just to double-check, maybe I should consider if there's any other term that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by something else. For example, could there be a term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that, when multiplied by a term from \\((a + b)^4\\), gives \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms? Well, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and no \\(c\\) is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial by the constant term from the second polynomial. Any other term in the second polynomial would introduce \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would make the product have \\(c\\) terms, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), those other terms don't contribute to the coefficient we're looking for. So, I think my approach is correct. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to realize that when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial multiplies each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient is the product of the coefficients of these two terms. So, that's 6 times 20, which is 120. Yep, that's consistent with what I found before.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. The key was realizing that the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so we only need to consider the constant term in the second polynomial. So, I feel confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero:\n\\[\n6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n\\]\nThe coefficient of the constant term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Wait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include all the terms from the second polynomial. So, actually, I think I might have been wrong earlier. Let me think again. When you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which has a coefficient of 6, when multiplied by each term in the second expansion, it will produce terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\text{something}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so we need to consider all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a term that has \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the term would have a power of \\(c\\) and wouldn't just be \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, actually, the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. That means we need to consider all possible terms in the product where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\) and any power of \\(c\\). But actually, no, because in the product, each term is a product of a term from the first polynomial and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these, we get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(15a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(20a^2b^2\\), \\(15a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), and \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just 20, because that's the coefficient when it's multiplied by \\(c^0\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables are independent. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the product for each term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), so it's a separate variable. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients in the second polynomial multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. Wait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But what's the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? To find the sum of coefficients, we can set \\(c = 1\\), because that makes each term equal to its coefficient. So, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but that seems too high. Let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384. But let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all terms in the other polynomial, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. That seems correct. So, 6 times 64 is 384. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), so then the coefficient would be 6 times 20 = 120. But the problem just says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think it's 384. Wait, but that seems counterintuitive because when you multiply by all the terms in the second polynomial, you're essentially scaling the coefficient by the sum of all coefficients. So, maybe that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be interpreted as finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 times 20, which is 120. Hmm, I'm a bit confused now. Let me try to clarify. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6a^2b^2. When we multiply this by the entire second polynomial, each term in the second polynomial will be multiplied by 6a^2b^2, resulting in terms like 6a^2b^2c^6, 6a^2b^2 \\times 6c^4, etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by 6. Because each term in the second polynomial, when multiplied by 6a^2b^2, contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is when we set \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\( (1 + 1)^6 = 64 \\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if we were looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, which is 20, giving 120. But since the problem doesn't specify the power of \\(c\\), I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384. Wait, but that seems too large. Let me think differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But in reality, each term in the product will have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), in which case it's 6 * 20 = 120. I'm not sure which interpretation is correct. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It just says \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms. So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by 6. Because each term in the second polynomial, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would be 6 * 20 = 120. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's 384. However, I might be making a mistake here. Let me think of it another way. Suppose I set \\(c = 1\\). Then the expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times (1 + 1)^6 = (a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems to confirm it. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. But I'm still a bit unsure because usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term, it's in the entire expansion, considering all variables. But in this case, since \\(c\\) is separate, maybe it's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Let me check that approach. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem didn't specify the \\(c^0\\) part, so I'm not sure. Wait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean that we need to consider all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120. Hmm, maybe I should look for similar problems or think about how such questions are usually phrased. Typically, when the problem asks for the coefficient of a term that doesn't involve another variable, it's considering all possible powers of that variable. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients where the term has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384. So, I think the answer is 384. But to make sure, let me think of a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion would be \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1 (from \\(a\\)) times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 2. Alternatively, if we were looking for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^0\\), it would be 1 * 1 = 1. So, in the original problem, since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), it's like the first case, where we multiply by the sum of coefficients. Therefore, I think the answer is 384. But I'm still a bit unsure because sometimes problems like this expect you to consider only the constant term. However, given the problem statement, I think 384 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

So, I think I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Let me confirm that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) (which has coefficient 6) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). How do I do that? Again, using the binomial theorem. Let me write out the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, this is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0 because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is the term when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, which is 6, and the constant term from the second part is 20, so 6 times 20 is indeed 120. Is there any other term that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without involving \\(c\\)? Let me think. If I take any other term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it would have a power of \\(c\\) either positive or negative, so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would result in a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is some integer, but we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), which has no \\(c\\) terms.

    "text": " Because if I take any other term from the second polynomial, it would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, which would make the term not purely \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, I need to take the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and multiply it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to do that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\cdot c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(6 = 2m\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So that's \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, correct. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20, correct. So, multiplying them together gives 120. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product and see if that makes sense. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part and the constant term in the second part. Since there's no overlap or anything else, that should be the only contribution. So, yes, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."
