So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together, 6 * 20 is 120. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I made any calculation errors here. So, I think the final answer is 120.\n\nWait, hold on a second. Let me think again. When we have the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we're only concerned with the terms where \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so that part is correct. But in the second polynomial, the term we need is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which is \\(m = 3\\), so that's correct too. So, the coefficient is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, yeah, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it another way. Since the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, that term must come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part by the constant term in the second part. Because if you take any other term from the second part, it will have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would make the product have a \\(c\\) term, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't have any \\(c\\), the only way that can happen is if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) in the second expansion. So, that again confirms that the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's solid.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can write out the expansions a bit more explicitly. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the expansion would be \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). So, the constant term is 20, which matches what I found earlier. So, when I multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but only the constant term (20) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, because multiplying by any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which we don't want. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Yep, that seems correct.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. The logic flows, and each step makes sense. So, I'm confident that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the relevant terms from each part of the product.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   - Using the binomial theorem, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\).\n   - Coefficient: 6.\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   - The term with \\(c^0\\) (constant term) is found by setting the exponent \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), giving \\(m = 3\\).\n   - Coefficient: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Combining the coefficients**:\n   - Multiply the coefficients from each expansion: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer**: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, each term has an exponent of \\(6 - 2m\\). We're looking for the term where the exponent is 0, because \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) and solve for \\(m\\). That gives \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.

Since these two terms are multiplied together in the original expression, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, when you have two separate expressions multiplied together, the coefficients of the terms multiply when the variables don't interfere. So, in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and the constant term from the second part. So, yes, their coefficients should multiply. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. I think that makes sense. Let me just double-check my binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, correct. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent is 0 is when \\(m = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20, correct. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Yeah, that seems right.
