    "text": " Simplifying each term, each term would be \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\cdot c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) will be the constant term. The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Since these two terms are multiplied together in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the product of these two coefficients. So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed the middle term when \\(k = 2\\), and \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), so that's correct. Then, for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponents cancel out, which happens when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), which is correct. Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120, so that seems right. I don't think I made any errors here. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. This corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Setting \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) gives \\(m = 3\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Let's simplify each term: Each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\cdot c^{-m}\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) will have \\(c^0\\). The coefficient for this term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial (which has coefficient 6) by the \\(c^0\\) term in the second polynomial (which has coefficient 20). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me double-check that. So, the first part is 6, the second part is 20, so 6 * 20 is indeed 120. Hmm, that seems right. So, I think the coefficient is 120.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider another approach. Alternatively, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). We're interested in the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for the \\(c\\) part, we need the exponent to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Yep, that's the same as before. So, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything else. Is there a possibility that other terms could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by terms from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)? For example, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^k\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) is to multiply by \\(c^0\\). So, any other term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would introduce a \\(c\\) term, which would make the entire product have a \\(c\\) term, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term without any \\(c\\), we only consider the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term and the \\(c^0\\) term. Therefore, no other terms contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\), so 120 is indeed the correct coefficient.\n\nJust to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. I think that's solid.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by considering the expansion of each part separately and then multiplying the relevant coefficients.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   - Using the binomial theorem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   - The term with \\(c^0\\) (constant term) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   - \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."
