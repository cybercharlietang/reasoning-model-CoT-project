So, when you multiply these two expansions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will multiply the constant term from the second part, giving 6 * 20 = 120. There are no other terms in \\((a + b)^4\\) that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by a term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) because any other term would involve higher or lower powers of \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), which wouldn't combine to \\(a^2b^2\\).

    "text": " Simplifying the exponents, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when we multiply these two expressions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by the constant term 20. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me double-check that. Is there any other term that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\)? For example, if there's a term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that's not a constant, but when multiplied by a term in \\((a + b)^4\\), it somehow still gives \\(a^2b^2\\). But since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, their exponents don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, any term in the second polynomial will only contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) if it's a constant term. Otherwise, the product will have a \\(c\\) term, which we don't want. So, I think my reasoning is correct. Therefore, the coefficient should be 120. Let me just recap: The coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. The coefficient from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) for \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiply them: 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The constant term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both parts:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). And in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent is 0 occurs when \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems correct. So, I think the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"
