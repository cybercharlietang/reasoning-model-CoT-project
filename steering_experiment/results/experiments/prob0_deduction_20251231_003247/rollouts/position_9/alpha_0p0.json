    "text": " That would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) in the binomial expansion, right? Because when \\(k = 2\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). So, the coefficient here is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider the entire product. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the second part, maybe the variables are separate. That is, the terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are multiplied by the terms in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, actually, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply as well. But in this case, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that might not be right. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4 = 6a^2b^2 + \\text{other terms}\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\text{some terms}\\), then when I multiply them, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the second expression. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expression, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and so on, but if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would require that the second part contributes a term with \\(c^0\\), because \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0 = a^2b^2\\). So, actually, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by 6. Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by the term with \\(c^0\\) (which is 1, the constant term), you get \\(6a^2b^2\\), and all other terms would involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which we don't want. So, the key is to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, let me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the constant term. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).

    "text": " That would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) in the binomial expansion, right? Because if \\(k = 2\\), then the exponent of \\(a\\) is \\(4 - 2 = 2\\) and the exponent of \\(b\\) is 2. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is equal to \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient I just found, 6, is multiplied by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is in the other part for the term that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Wait, actually, no. Wait, the entire expression is a product of two expansions, so when I multiply them together, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't affect the terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is just the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient isn't just a number but a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps I'm misunderstanding something. Wait, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(c\\) is separate, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient would then be a polynomial, not a single number. Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, so perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the powers of \\(c\\) as well. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). Similarly, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. So, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 6c^4\\), and so on, depending on the terms in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms that result from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the terms in the second expansion. However, that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make much sense because coefficients are usually constants, not expressions in other variables. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, effectively the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). That would make more sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, let me assume that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nAlright, so first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\) so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. \n\nNow, since the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) (which is just \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\)) is the product of the coefficients we found. So, that would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through it again. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\). The other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), has a term \\(20c^0\\). When I multiply these two, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) times \\(20c^0\\) gives me \\(120a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(120a^2b^2\\). So, yes, the coefficient is indeed 120. \n\nAlternatively, if I consider the entire expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some expression in \\(c\\), but unless specified otherwise, I think it's safe to assume that we're looking for the constant term in \\(c\\), i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial, which doesn't make sense in this context. So, I think 120 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me think about the entire product. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanded, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{(each term in the second expansion)}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that includes all possible powers of \\(c\\), but in the context of coefficients, usually, we're looking for the constant term unless specified otherwise. So, I think 120 is correct. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the coefficients from the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which is unusual. So, I think the intended interpretation is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nLet me double-check the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. The key was realizing that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would involve multiplying the coefficient from the first part by the constant term from the second part. So, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Next, we find the constant term (exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6, and the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That suggests that I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).

So, that would be the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a constant, it remains \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant. \n\nSo, perhaps I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about that. The expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can also be expanded using the binomial theorem. So, expanding that, we get \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).

So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).

But no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), so any term involving \\(c\\) would change the term. So, only the constant term in the second expression would multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) without changing it. Therefore, my calculation seems correct. \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.

    "text": " That would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) because when \\(k = 2\\), the exponent of \\(b\\) is 2, and the exponent of \\(a\\) is \\(4 - 2 = 2\\).

So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I notice that this term comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), because the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), that term comes only from the first part, and the second part contributes a term that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second part, because the second part is being multiplied by 1 (since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\)). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the first part, and it's being multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), then actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second expansion, because any other term would involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would make the product have terms involving \\(c\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think refers to the term without any \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but actually, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Hmm, no, that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only includes \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), then the only way that happens is if the second part contributes a term that is 1, i.e., \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, you'd have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), which would give terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, I need to compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nLet me compute that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient from the second part is 20.\n\nNow, since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\) in the second part, the overall coefficient is the product of the two coefficients: 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20. So, when you multiply these two terms together, you get \\(6 \\times 20 \\times a^2b^2 \\times c^0\\), which is \\(120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the second part. So, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m}\\) which simplifies to \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), \\(m = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), which is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of the problem as: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in each part, but since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient from the second part is just 1, but that's not correct because the second part is raised to the 6th power and contributes a term that is multiplied by the first part. Wait, no, actually, the second part is a separate binomial expansion, so when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but we are only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would come from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) and the term in the second expansion that is 1, i.e., \\(c^0\\), because any other term would involve \\(c\\) and thus change the term to something like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is not just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, only the term where the second expansion contributes 1 (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) will result in a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the entire expression is a product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from the first part, and since the second part is multiplied by 1 (because we're looking for the term where it's \\(c^0\\)), the overall coefficient is just 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if I considered the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) factors, then only the term where the second part is 1 (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) would contribute to that. So, yeah, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm not missing something. Suppose I didn't consider the second part, would the coefficient just be 6? But no, because the entire expression is multiplied by the second part, which includes terms with \\(c\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that's not the case. Wait, no, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, actually, no, because in the product, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by every term from the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then that's a different question. But I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without any \\(c\\), so actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only appear if it's multiplied by \\(c^0\\) in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), then we would have to consider that, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), the only way that happens is if \\(c^0\\) is multiplied by it, so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I didn't care about the \\(c\\) terms, and just wanted the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) power. Then, that would be the sum over all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. But that would actually be an infinite series if we didn't have the exponents limited, but in this case, the second expansion is finite. But in reality, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. But that's not correct because each term in the product is a combination of terms from both expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion's sum, but that doesn't make sense because the second expansion isn't a scalar; it's a polynomial. Wait, no, that's not the right way to think about it. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and each term from the second part. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first part, and the second part is being multiplied, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present in the product as \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) (each term from the second expansion). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, but that can't be right because the second part's sum of coefficients is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), so then the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384, which seems too high. But that would be the case if we were summing all coefficients, but actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire second expansion, which isn't a number but a polynomial. Therefore, I think my initial approach was correct: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120.\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms in each polynomial that combine to form that specific term. In this case, the specific term is \\(a^2b^2\\). Since the first polynomial is \\((a + b)^4\\) and the second is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the first polynomial because the second polynomial doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. But wait, that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nWait, no, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first polynomial, and when you multiply it by the second polynomial, you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term of the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will have coefficients that are the products of 6 (the coefficient from the first part) and each coefficient from the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would actually be the sum of all these products. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and I think I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, no, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if it's multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\) from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), giving 120. That makes sense because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any other term from the second polynomial, you'd get terms like \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, only the term where the second polynomial contributes \\(c^0\\) will result in a term that is exactly \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from \\(2ab \\times 1/c\\) or something? Wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present in the first expansion unless we have a higher power. Wait, in this smaller example, the first expansion is \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), so there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, perhaps my initial example isn't helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let's take \\((a + b)^3 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). Expanding, \\((a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3) \\times (c^2 + 2 + 2/c + 1/c^2)\\). The term \\(a^2b\\) would come from \\(3a^2b\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b\\), it would be 3 times each coefficient in the second expansion, but that would be if I'm considering the term \\(a^2b\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But if I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, then it would be 3 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 2, so 3 * 2 = 6. That seems correct because the term \\(a^2b \\times c^0\\) would be present with coefficient 6.\n\nSimilarly, in the original problem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present only when multiplied by \\(c^0\\), so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, after all this thinking, I believe the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{120}"

    "text": " That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\) and \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). Let me check that: if \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\), so yes, that's the term. So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider how this part affects the coefficient. Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms? Hmm, let me think. Because the problem is about \\(a^2b^2\\), which are in the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it. So, actually, when we multiply the two expressions, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps we don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms because they are separate variables. Wait, that might not be correct. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, actually, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand this, we'll have terms that are products of terms from each expansion. But the problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that means we need to find all the terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). Wait, but that's not possible because each term in the product will have some power of \\(c\\) as well. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible exponents of \\(c\\). But that seems a bit odd because the variables are different. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the part of the expansion that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a sum over all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). But that seems complicated.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by some term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second expansion has terms with \\(c\\), so each term in the product would be of the form \\((\\text{term from first expansion}) \\times (\\text{term from second expansion})\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion, but that's not correct because the second expansion has terms with \\(c\\) which are separate variables.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only considering the part of the expansion where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a constant, but that also doesn't make much sense because \\(c\\) is a variable.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\). Simplifying that, it's \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as I found earlier, so \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the term from the second part will be \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the entire coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\), but I think I'm supposed to sum over all possible \\(m\\), but that's not the case because each term in the product is multiplied by each term in the other expansion. Wait, no, that's not correct. Actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term is a product of terms from each polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) multiplied by \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a function of \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Hmm, I must be misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, ignoring the \\(c\\) terms. But that's not standard. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when the entire expression is expanded, considering only the terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That makes more sense.\n\nSo, let me approach it that way. So, we have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). We need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, that means we need to find all terms in the product where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, from the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. From the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\). Let me find that.\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Now, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product, it's the product of the coefficients from each part. So, that's 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), which equals 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. So, the first part gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and the second part gives \\(c^0\\) with coefficient 20. So, when we multiply these two parts, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\) from the second part, which is 1, so the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem was just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, I think the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. For the first part, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is indeed 6. For the second part, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20, because 6 choose 3 is 20. So, 6 * 20 is 120. That seems correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the contributions from each part of the product.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):** Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):** The term \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\).

So, I need to consider that entire product. Now, the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire expression, which also includes terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\), so when I multiply the two expressions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\).

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't affect the terms involving \\(c\\).

Wait, no, actually, that's not quite right. Let me think again. \n\nWhen you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. In this case, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all different variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product can only come from multiplying the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) by any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because none of the terms in the second polynomial have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only contribution comes from the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. But that doesn't seem right because the second part has terms with different powers of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the total coefficient is 6 (from the first part) times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. \n\nBut wait, how do I find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Because when I set \\(c = 1\\), I get the sum of the coefficients, which is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the first part, and the second part contributes a factor of its entire sum of coefficients because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and since \\(c\\) is a separate variable, the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient is indeed the product of the coefficients from each part. \n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term is the sum over all possible products of coefficients from each polynomial that result in that term. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only contribution comes from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial by every term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break it down into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Evaluate the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " That would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) in the binomial expansion because \\(b^k = b^2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^{2}b^{2}\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that term is only present in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when we multiply them together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will have terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but the problem is only asking about \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so when we multiply these two expansions, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that would mean that we're looking for the term in \\((a + b)^4\\) that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because \\(c^0 = 1\\), so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, first, let's confirm the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I found earlier as 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do that, I can use the binomial theorem again. Let me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, it's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\) from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\)). So, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by \\(c^0\\) from the second part, so the combined term is \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, because when you multiply them, you get the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with the combined coefficient. That seems correct.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: when you have two separate variables, \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), their expansions are independent. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the first part, and it's multiplied by all terms from the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we have to pick the term in the second expansion that doesn't involve \\(c\\), which is \\(c^0\\), and then multiply the coefficients. So, yes, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me check if there's another way this could happen. Suppose I expand both parts and then multiply them. But since \\(a, b, c\\) are all different variables, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and \\(c^0\\) from the second expansion. There's no other way because any other term from the second expansion would involve \\(c\\) raised to some power, which would make the term have \\(c\\) in it, but we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, that confirms that the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) again. 4 choose 2 is 6, correct. And \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20, correct. So, 6 times 20 is 120. So, the coefficient is 120. \n\nI think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from the two expansions:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean that the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, let me think. When you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider how that term interacts with the second part. But wait, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\), right? So, the terms in the second expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) involve \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), which are different variables. So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expression, the resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think I need to consider the part of the expression that doesn't change the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, but that doesn't quite make sense. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is from the second expression. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense either. Let me re-read the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the product, but the entire product includes terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expression multiplied by the coefficient from the first expression. Wait, that is, if I think of it as multiplying two polynomials, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But wait, no, because each term in the product is a combination of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) (for any k) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, but that seems a bit off. Alternatively, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), but that's not standard. Usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term in a product, you consider the term as a whole, including all variables. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try another approach. Let me expand both parts separately and see how they combine. First, \\((a + b)^4\\) expands to \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\), where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. Now, when I multiply the two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, which are \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, in the product, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each of these, resulting in terms like \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes a factor that, when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), gives a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum the coefficients from the second expansion. Wait, but that might not be the case. Let me think again. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then yes, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that, when multiplied by 6, adds to the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). Let me check that: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) evaluated at \\(c = 1\\) is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but that seems high. Let me verify. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which includes all variables, so I might have misread it. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, in the product, each term is a combination of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, for example, a term like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\) would be part of the product. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all terms where the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, which is 64, as I calculated earlier. So, 6 times 64 is indeed 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's not specified. The problem just says \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think it's considering all possible \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. So, I think that's the answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps. First, I expanded \\((a + b)^4\\) and found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, I considered that when multiplying by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. Since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we need to sum all the coefficients from the second expansion, which is done by evaluating it at \\(c = 1\\), giving 64. Then, multiplying 6 by 64 gives 384. That seems correct. So, I think the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Evaluating the second expression at \\(c = 1\\) gives a sum of 64. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would add more terms, but the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by each term in that expansion. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include all possible coefficients from the second expansion. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, actually, no, because the variables are different. The first part is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables are separate. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, that can't be because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, maybe it's considering the entire product, and we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, we're looking for all terms where the product has \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), and we need the sum of the coefficients of those terms. Wait, but that seems a bit complicated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but that might not make sense because \\(c\\) and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually expecting that we treat the entire expression as a product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), right? Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) times 64 (from the sum of coefficients in the second part), which would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The problem could be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any term in the second expansion, but the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which usually refers to the coefficient regardless of other variables. So, perhaps the answer is just 6, because the other part is multiplied by the entire expansion, but that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term is multiplied by each term in the other expansion. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2. When you multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you get 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 times each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, each term in the product would be 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 times some term involving \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a\u00b2b\u00b2\\) in the entire product would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a\u00b2b\u00b2\\) in the entire product is 6 * (sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)). The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. But let me verify this another way. Alternatively, maybe I can consider the entire expansion. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it's multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would have to compute it differently, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me consider a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion is \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would also be 2. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is indeed 2, which is 1 * 2. So, applying the same logic, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and see what the sum of coefficients is. The sum of coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), which matches what I thought earlier. So, yes, the sum is 64. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. In this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first polynomial and \\(c\\) is in the second, the terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, each contributing their own coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. Let me consider the entire expression. \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Then, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which expands to various terms involving \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, c^0, c^{-2}, c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\), each with their own coefficients. So, when I multiply 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 by each of these terms, I get 6a\u00b2b\u00b2c^6 + 6a\u00b2b\u00b2c^4 + ... etc. So, each term has a coefficient of 6 times the coefficient from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^6\\) in the second expansion, and similarly for other powers. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, it's the sum of all coefficients of terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), for example, then I would have to compute the coefficient of \\(c^2\\) in the second expansion and multiply it by 6. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I have to consider all possible coefficients from the second expansion. So, yes, 384 seems to be the right answer.\n\nWait, but let me check the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) to make sure the sum of coefficients is indeed 64. Let me compute it:\n\n\\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, the coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for each term. The sum of coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), which matches. Therefore, the sum of coefficients is indeed 64.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, that part is 6. Now, the original expression also has the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm not sure if I need to expand that as well, but maybe I do. Wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which are variables in the first part. The second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so maybe their terms don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The entire expression is a product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient from the second part must be 1 because it's just multiplying by 1 for each term. Wait, that might not be correct. Let me think again. Wait, no. The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which expands to terms involving \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). Each of these terms will have coefficients, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find the term in the second expansion where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the only term that won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term when multiplied. So, the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\) is the middle term, right? Because the exponents go from 6 down to -6 in steps of 2. So, the term where \\(c^0\\) occurs is when the exponent is zero, which happens when the number of \\(c\\) terms and \\(1/c\\) terms are equal. So, in the expansion, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). Therefore, the term with \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when we multiply the two expansions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is 6, and the \\(c^0\\) term from the second part is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something because the problem is the product of two expansions, and perhaps I should consider that each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only term from the second expansion that contributes is the constant term, which is 20. So, yes, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the entire product's expansion would have terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), then the only term that contributes is the one where the second expansion gives 1 (i.e., the constant term). So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.

Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6.\n\nBut wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire expression. Hmm, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), right? So, does that mean that when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Wait, no, that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), which don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. When I have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other expression involves \\(c\\), the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if it's multiplied by some term in the second expansion that doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). But actually, no, because the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a term in \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient is a number, and the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a sum of terms, so how does that affect the coefficient? Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, the problem is treating \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) as separate variables, and we need to find the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is... well, whatever it is, but the term is \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Wait, but the question only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). So, perhaps the problem is considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because each term in the product will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. So, perhaps the question is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be a polynomial, not a single number. Hmm, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we're looking for the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, like \\(c^0\\). Wait, but that's not necessarily the case. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient would then be a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. That makes more sense.\n\nSo, to clarify, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, to find that, I need to expand both parts and find the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\).\n\nFirst, let's expand \\((a + b)^4\\) as before. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier.\n\nNext, let's consider \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I can expand this using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But we're only interested in the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., \\(c^0\\), because that's the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 1, making it just \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That happens when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(2k = 6\\), which means \\(k = 3\\). So, the term where \\(k = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} \\times 1 = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient from the second expansion is 20.\n\nNow, since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion has a coefficient of 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) from the second expansion has a coefficient of 20, the combined coefficient when multiplying these two terms is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), gives me \\(a^2b^2\\) with a coefficient of 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has a term with \\(c^0\\) when \\(k = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when I multiply these two parts together, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. That seems right.\n\nLet me just double-check my calculations. For \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), yes, that's 6. For \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), that's 20. Multiplying them gives 120. So, I think that's the correct coefficient.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem by considering the entire expansion. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and it's multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), we need to consider the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that are multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But actually, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a scalar multiple when multiplied by the other expansion. Wait, no, that's not the case. Each term in the product will be of the form \\(a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m}\\), but I think I'm complicating it again. The key is that to get \\(a^2b^2\\), we need \\(k = 2\\) in the first expansion, and then in the second expansion, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Yep, that's consistent with what I found earlier.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part. \n\n1.

Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(c^0\\) (i.e., \\(m = 3\\)) has the coefficient:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. Multiply the coefficients from both expansions:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I have to consider the product of two expansions: one in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests that I might not need to consider the \\(c\\) terms at all, or maybe I do? Wait, actually, no. Because the entire expression is the product of both expansions, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms involving \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and not involving \\(c\\), I think that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion evaluated at a specific term. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the expression is a product of two separate expansions, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) part and the \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) part. So, when you multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is just a constant with respect to the second expansion. So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you'll get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), and so on. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion because \\(c^0\\) is 1, and that would leave \\(a^2b^2\\) as a standalone term. Wait, but does the second expansion have a \\(c^0\\) term? Let me check.\n\nYes, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will have a term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me find that term. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the exponent to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(c\\) has exponent zero is when \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original expression: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we multiply these two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But we are only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). However, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will only appear as \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion, which is 20. All other terms from the second expansion will introduce powers of \\(c\\), so they won't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from the first expansion, which is 6, multiplied by the coefficient from the second expansion's constant term, which is 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the first part gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part has a constant term with coefficient 20. So, when you multiply these together, the constant term in the second expansion doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term because it's just a scalar multiplier. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the product of the two expansions, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient will be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the second expansion's constant term. When m = 3, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{6 - 2*3} = 20 c^0 = 20\\). So that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me think again. Because the problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand both, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, and in the second expansion, the term is 20. So, when you multiply them, you get 6 * 20 a\u00b2b\u00b2, which is 120a\u00b2b\u00b2. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. That makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if I had to write out the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from the first expansion, and it would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero would result in a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. All other terms would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, so they wouldn't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, only the constant term from the second expansion affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion. So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't overlook anything, let me consider if there's another way this term could appear. For example, could there be a cross term where some \\(c\\) terms combine with \\(a^2b^2\\) to give another \\(a^2b^2\\) term? But no, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so any term involving \\(c\\) would have to be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient would just be the product of the two coefficients as I calculated before.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), then I would have to consider different terms, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), it's only affected by the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nSo, I think my reasoning is correct. The coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the coefficients:**\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " That would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) in the binomial expansion. Let me calculate the coefficient for that term. The binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6. So, the term is \\(6a^{2}b^{2}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider both parts. But the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is part of the first binomial expansion. However, since the entire expression is a product of two binomials raised to powers, I might need to consider how the terms multiply. Wait, but the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are only in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply the two parts together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, the coefficients from the second part don't affect it. Wait, is that right? Hmm, let me think again. Actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. However, since the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), it won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the same as in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the other terms involving \\(c\\) don't contribute to that specific term. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, because the other part doesn't influence the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the two parts are multiplied together, and the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, regardless of the second part. So, the answer would be 6. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. Maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the entire expression is multiplied, so the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all terms in the second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only contribution comes from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part multiplied by the constant term (if any) in the second part. Wait, but the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that to see if it has a constant term. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). For a term to be a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), we need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, when I multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part by the constant term from the second part, the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, that makes more sense. So, I think I was initially confused, but now I realize that the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), right? So, let me compute that. The coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). I remember that \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as \\(4! / (2! * (4 - 2)!) = (4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / (2 * 1 * 2 * 1) = 24 / 4 = 6\\).

Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That seems to be just from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), because the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) in them. So, when I multiply the two expansions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part.

Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me make sure I'm not missing anything. \n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is a single term, and when multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it will result in \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the other variables, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Wait, no, actually, when you have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any term from the second expansion, the resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficients from the second expansion will just multiply the 6. Wait, but no, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes a term to the product. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), right? So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but hold on, that seems too high. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in the first part, and when multiplied by any term from the second part, it will still be \\(a^2b^2\\) times something. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that multiplies the 6. \n\nBut let me check that. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of two independent expansions. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part with coefficient 6, and the second part's expansion has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), \\(1/c^6\\). Each of these terms, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will result in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, each of these terms contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because they all have \\(a^2b^2\\) as a factor. Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nBut wait, the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion is when we set \\(c = 1\\), so that gives us \\( (1 + 1/1)^6 = 2^6 = 64 \\). Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. \n\nWait, but let me verify this another way. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as the product of two polynomials, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part, considering that the second part's expansion doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and since the second part is multiplied by that, the coefficient remains 6. But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply by the second part, which has multiple terms, each term would scale the 6. So, actually, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, perhaps another approach. Let me consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and when I multiply by the second part, each term in the second part is a power of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but maybe I should think about it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) being multiplied by the entire second expansion, so the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the expansion of the second part and see what the sum of its coefficients is. Let me compute \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, it's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for each term. The sum of the coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so it's \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), as I thought before. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me check with a different approach. Let me think of the entire expression as a product. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a sum of coefficients equal to 64. So, when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in each product will be 6 times the coefficient from the second expansion. Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but perhaps I'm confusing the term \"coefficient\" here. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all the products of coefficients from each part that result in \\(a^2b^2\\). But in this case, since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiplying it by any term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient being 6 multiplied by each coefficient in the second expansion, and then adding them all up. But since the second expansion's coefficients sum to 64, it's just 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me confirm this with a smaller example to make sure. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is \\(\\dbinom{2}{1} = 2\\). The second part is \\(c + 1/c\\), whose coefficients sum to 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product should be 2 * 2 = 4. Let me check by expanding: \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). Multiply by \\(c + 1/c\\): \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present here because the second part only has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), not \\(ab\\). Wait, so in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Hmm, that contradicts my earlier logic. So, perhaps my approach is wrong. \n\nWait, that's confusing. In the small example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. But according to my earlier logic, it should be 2 * 2 = 4. That's a problem. So, maybe I made a mistake in my reasoning. \n\nWait, so in the small example, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the expansion is \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). There's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term because \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) are separate. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero. But according to my earlier logic, it should be 2 * 2 = 4, which is incorrect. So, that means my approach is wrong. \n\nSo, perhaps I need to think differently. The problem arises because when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first part, and when multiplied by any term from the second part, it doesn't create a new term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\); rather, it just scales the coefficient. Wait, but in the small example, when I multiplied \\((a + b)^2\\) by \\((c + 1/c)\\), I didn't get any \\(a^2b^2\\) terms because \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) are separate. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually just the coefficient from the first part, regardless of the second part, because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). \n\nWait, but in the small example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because there's no such term in the product. But in the original problem, \\((a + b)^4\\) does have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the product will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the same as the coefficient from the first part, because when you multiply by the second part, you're just scaling each term by the coefficients from the second expansion. But in the small example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because it's not present. Wait, so maybe in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. \n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because in the small example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero, but according to that logic, it should be 2, which is the coefficient from the first part. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the small example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there are no such terms. But in the original problem, since \\((a + b)^4\\) has an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, when multiplied by each term in the second expansion, it will create terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. \n\nWait, but in the small example, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\) doesn't have any \\(a^2b^2\\) terms, so the coefficient is zero. So, perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but in the small example, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 2, so 2 * 2 = 4, but the actual coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero. So, that approach must be wrong. Therefore, my initial approach was incorrect. \n\nSo, perhaps the correct way is to realize that in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it just scales the coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But in the small example, this approach would predict a coefficient of 4, but the actual coefficient is zero. Therefore, this approach is flawed. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the concepts here. Let me clarify: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the sum of all products of coefficients from each part that result in \\(a^2b^2\\). But since the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by any term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut in the small example, this approach would suggest that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 2 * 2 = 4, but in reality, it's zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, why is that? Because in the small example, the second part is only to the first power, so when you multiply \\(a^2\\) by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), you get \\(a^2c\\) and \\(a^2/c\\), and similarly for \\(b^2\\). There's no way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) because you're multiplying by terms that only involve \\(c\\), not \\(ab\\). \n\nWait, so in the original problem, the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you just get \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\), but \\(a^2b^2\\) itself doesn't involve \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just 6, because it's the coefficient from the first part, and the second part doesn't affect it. \n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier thought process. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product comes only from the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it's just scaled by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but in the small example, this approach would fail because it would predict a non-zero coefficient when in reality it's zero. So, perhaps the correct way is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so it doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but in the original problem, the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), \\(1/c^6\\). When you multiply these by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, each of these terms has \\(a^2b^2\\) as a factor, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, each of these terms contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut in the small example, the second part is \\((c + 1/c)^1\\), which has coefficients summing to 2. So, according to this logic, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 2 * 2 = 4, but in reality, it's zero. So, there must be something wrong with this approach. \n\nWait, perhaps the key is that in the original problem, the second part is to the 6th power, which is even, so when you expand it, the constant term is 20. So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by 20, you get \\(20a^2b^2\\), which is a term with \\(a^2b^2\\). Similarly, when you multiply by other terms, you get \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^6\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. \n\nWait, but in the small example, the second part is to the first power, which is odd, so there's no constant term. Therefore, when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you don't get any term with just \\(a^2b^2\\), only terms with \\(a^2b^2c\\) and \\(a^2b^2/c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero. \n\nSo, in the original problem, since the second part is to the 6th power, which is even, the expansion will have a constant term, which is 20. Therefore, when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get \\(20a^2b^2\\), which contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Similarly, all other terms in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will result in terms with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. \n\nWait, but in the small example, the second part is to the first power, which is odd, so there's no constant term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero. So, perhaps the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, but only if the second expansion has a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), i.e., a constant term. \n\nWait, but in the original problem, the second expansion does have a constant term, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by 20, you get \\(20a^2b^2\\), which is a term with \\(a^2b^2\\). Similarly, when you multiply by other terms, you get \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^6\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. \n\nWait, but in the small example, the second expansion doesn't have a constant term, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion that result in a constant term (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero). \n\nIn the original problem, the second expansion \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a constant term when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier reasoning. Let me think carefully. \n\nIf the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) (i.e., the term where \\(c\\) is zero), then it's just 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. \n\nBut in the small example, the second expansion is \\((c + 1/c)^1\\), which has coefficients 1 and 1. The sum is 2. So, according to that logic, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 2 * 2 = 4, but in reality, it's zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, that approach must be wrong. \n\nSo, perhaps the correct way is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just 6, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that can't be right because when you multiply by the second part, you're scaling the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by each coefficient in the second expansion, so the coefficient becomes 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but in the small example, that approach gives a wrong result, so perhaps the problem is different. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(c\\) is zero. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but in the small example, that approach would predict a coefficient of 4, but the actual coefficient is zero. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is different. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which could imply any power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut then, in the small example, the coefficient would be 2 * 2 = 4, but in reality, it's zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, perhaps the problem is different. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is written correctly, and I'm misapplying the logic. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which includes all powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). \n\nWait, but that can't be right because when you multiply by the second part, you're scaling each term, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. \n\nWait, perhaps the confusion comes from whether the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the other variables or just the term \\(a^2b^2\\) without any other variables. If it's the former, then the coefficient is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 384. If it's the latter, then it's zero because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have to be multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), making it \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms would be zero unless there's a constant term in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but in the original problem, the second expansion does have a constant term, which is 20. So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by 20, you get \\(20a^2b^2\\), which is a term with \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but then what about the other terms? For example, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^6\\), you get \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), which has a coefficient of 6. Similarly, multiplying by \\(6c^4\\) gives \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), and so on. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) appears in each of these products, each with a different power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. \n\nWait, but in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but in the small example, this approach would give 2 * 2 = 4, but the actual coefficient is zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, perhaps the problem is different. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would include all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384. \n\nBut in the small example, this approach would give 4, but the actual coefficient is zero. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(c\\) is zero. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in the second expansion, which is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, which is 384. \n\nI'm getting confused here. Let me try to clarify. \n\nThe problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nIf the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, which is 64 * 6 = 384. \n\nIf the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(c\\) is zero, then it's 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nGiven that the problem is written as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying \\(c\\), it's ambiguous. However, in standard terminology, the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) in a product would include all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of other variables. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut in the small example, this approach fails, so perhaps the problem is different. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to have the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), so the coefficient is 120. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, which would include all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nI think I need to resolve this confusion. Let me check the original problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". \n\nIn this context, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" would typically mean the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. \n\nSo, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut in the small example, this approach gives a wrong result. So, perhaps the problem is different. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but in that case, the problem should specify \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Since it doesn't, I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384. \n\nTherefore, after all this thinking, I conclude that the coefficient is 384. \n\nBut wait, let me verify with another approach. Let me compute the product of the two expansions. The first part is \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15"

    "text": " That would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) in the binomial expansion, right? Because when \\(k = 2\\), the exponent of \\(b\\) is 2, and the exponent of \\(a\\) is \\(4 - 2 = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider how this multiplication affects the term \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, so the expression is a product of two binomials: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since these are multiplied together, when I expand them, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think I can treat these two parts separately because the variables involved are different. In other words, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms don't interact with the \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply by a term, the coefficient gets multiplied by each term in the other expansion. Wait, no, maybe that's not quite right. Let me think again. Actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all different variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) by any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because the variables are distinct. So, each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a power of \\(c\\), either positive or negative, but when you multiply it by \\(a^2b^2\\), it just adds a factor of that term to the coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit confusing. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression will be multiplied by every term in the second expression. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that means that any term involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) will just carry along as coefficients. So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit odd because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient, not considering \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me reread the problem. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. So, in other words, the coefficient will be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient, so maybe it's okay. Alternatively, maybe the problem wants the coefficient without considering \\(c\\), but I don't think so because \\(c\\) is part of the expression. Wait, no, actually, when you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by all possible terms from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), multiplied by 6. But that doesn't seem right either because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term would be \\(a^2b^2\\) times a term in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in that expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient becomes that coefficient times \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to find the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes coefficient times \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that can't be. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the product, but it's multiplied by all the terms from the other expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each multiplied by 6. But that doesn't make sense because then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), because that makes each term equal to its coefficient. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all variables, but that seems unlikely because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\). Wait, but in the product, each term is a combination of powers of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient is just the numerical factor in front of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's considering all possible \\(k\\), which would mean summing over all the coefficients from the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expansion, each multiplied by 6. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems odd because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try another approach. Let me consider the entire expression as a product of two independent binomial expansions. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) expands to terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to terms involving \\(c\\). Since the variables are different, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 * \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient, not a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), meaning that we need to sum over all possible coefficients from the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As I thought earlier, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But let me verify this another way. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. To do that, we can consider the product as two separate expansions and find the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) match. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as we found earlier. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is the middle term, which is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the term where \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, so now I'm getting two different answers depending on how I interpret the problem. If I consider the problem as asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 384. But if I consider it as asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. Hmm, which interpretation is correct? Let me look back at the problem statement: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, but without any restriction on \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), meaning that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is usually a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient when \\(c^0\\) is present, meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, I'm a bit confused now. Let me try to clarify. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be formed by multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by each term in the second part. So, each term in the second part is of the form \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the term becomes \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually a sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, each multiplied by 6. Because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that gets multiplied by 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that would mean that the coefficient is 384, which is a number, not a polynomial. But when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you're getting terms like \\(384a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(384a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be consistent for each power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, each term in the second expansion has its own coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient times \\(c^k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) alone, without considering \\(c\\), would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, each multiplied by 6, because each term in the second expansion contributes to a different power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems a bit counterintuitive because when you have different powers of \\(c\\), each term would have its own coefficient, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). So, maybe the answer is 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which would be 120. But since the problem doesn't specify, I'm not sure. Wait, let me think about how coefficients work in products of polynomials. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that specific term. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, each term in the second polynomial is of the form \\(k \\cdot c^m\\), where \\(k\\) is the coefficient and \\(m\\) is the exponent. So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these, you get terms like \\(6 \\cdot k \\cdot a^2b^2c^m\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^m\\) in the product is \\(6k\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\) would be the sum of all \\(6k\\) for all \\(m\\). So, that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients \\(k\\) in the second polynomial. Since the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, I think that's the correct answer. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   This expansion will contribute various powers of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). However, since we are only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum all the coefficients from this expansion.\n\n3. **Find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives:\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n4. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " That would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) in the binomial expansion, right? Because when \\(k = 2\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^{4 - 2}b^2 = \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so the next part is to consider this term. But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which are variables in the first part. The second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when we multiply the two expressions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables from \\(c\\), so when we multiply, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, times whatever the expansion of the second part is, but since it's multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe it's just 6 times the entire expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, that can't be right because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient times \\(c^k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it's 6 times that coefficient times \\(c^k\\). But wait, that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems too high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, but since the entire expression includes terms with \\(c\\), maybe the problem is considering \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But that would be the case if we were to collect like terms, but in reality, each term in the second expansion is a separate term with different powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out to 0. That would be different. Let me check the problem again: it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's considering all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems correct because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which has coefficients. Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), we would have to find the specific term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, which would be the middle term of the second expansion. Let me see, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). To have \\(c^0\\), we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I think it's asking for all terms with \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but considering that the product includes terms with \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think the answer is 384. But let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and since the second part is multiplied by 64 (the sum of the coefficients), the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve considering all possible combinations where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expression. But since the second expression is in terms of \\(c\\), which is a different variable, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear in the product as \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term of the second expression.

So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient. Let me think about this. When I multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, in this case, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will get multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). That means I need to find the part of the expansion where the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, so that when I multiply by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, I'm left with just a constant (i.e., a term without \\(c\\)). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because \\(c^0 = 1\\), so that's the constant term.\n\nAlright, so now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem for this. Let me write that out. \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). I need the term where the exponent is 0 because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) and solve for \\(m\\). \n\nLet me solve for \\(m\\): \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) implies \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, let me check that again. 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 6!/(3!3!) is 720/(6*6) which is 720/36, which is indeed 20. So, the constant term is 20. \n\nTherefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), because when you multiply the terms, the coefficients multiply. So, 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the first part gives me 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives me 20 for the constant term. So, when I multiply them together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term gets multiplied by 20, giving me 6 * 20 = 120 as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). That makes sense because when you multiply two terms, their coefficients multiply, and the variables multiply as well, but since the second term is a constant, the variables remain \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nLet me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps. First, I expanded \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem and found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, I needed to consider the other part of the expression, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and find its constant term because that's what, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would give me a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I expanded that using the binomial theorem and found the constant term is 20 when \\(m = 3\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. \n\nI think that's correct. Let me just check if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe by considering the entire expansion, but that would be more complicated. Alternatively, I could think of the expression as a product of two independent binomial expansions and recognize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the constant term in the second expansion because any \\(c\\) terms would introduce variables that aren't in \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that's why we only need the constant term from the second part. \n\nAnother way to think about it is that when you have two separate variables, \\(a, b\\) and \\(c, 1/c\\), the terms in the first expansion don't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply, the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) is to multiply by the constant term from the second expansion. So, that's consistent with what I did earlier. \n\nSo, yeah, I think I did this correctly. The coefficient is 120. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term with \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from the two expansions:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), so \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nNow, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression is the product of these two expansions. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I realize that this term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\). That means, when I multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), does that mean we just take the coefficient from the first part and multiply it by the entire second expansion? Wait, no, that can't be right. Because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product, but the product will have terms involving both \\(a, b\\) and \\(c, 1/c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, that means that for each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Wait, but I think that might not be the case. Actually, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term from the first expansion, when we multiply it by each term from the second expansion, each of those products will be terms in the overall expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Wait, but that can't be, because when you multiply by the second expansion, which has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), etc. So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself isn't present in the product unless multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. So, maybe I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion. That way, the constant term in the second expansion will just contribute a scalar multiple, so the product \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term will give a term \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the constant term from the second part. \n\nWait, let me make sure I'm thinking correctly. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when I expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these, I get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only come from the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term. Because if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\), that's a different term unless \\(k = 0\\). So, the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is when the second factor is the constant term. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion, which is 6. \n\nSo, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. So, the coefficient is 120. \n\nWait, let me just double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a constant term 20. So, when you multiply these two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by 20 from the second part, giving \\(20a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 20 multiplied by 6, which is 120. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"
