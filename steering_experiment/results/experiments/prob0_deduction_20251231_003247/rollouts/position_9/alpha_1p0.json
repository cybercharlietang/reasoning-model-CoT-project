    "text": " That would happen when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me check: If \\(k = 2\\), then \\(a^{4 - 2} = a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\). So, the coefficient for that term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you're adding terms that involve \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, is that right? Wait, no, that can't be. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, actually, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Wait, but the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them together, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2 \\times 6c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would actually be the sum of all coefficients from the second part multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, actually, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product will be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would mean we're considering all possible coefficients from the second expression multiplied by the coefficient from the first expression. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) is if the exponent of \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., when you multiply by the term that has \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, to clarify, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expression, you get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant, which contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Any other terms from the second expression would introduce powers of \\(c\\), so they wouldn't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) alone. So, first, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me use the binomial theorem again for this. \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again: \\(6! = 720\\), \\(3! = 6\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 720 / (6 \\times 6) = 720 / 36 = 20\\). Yes, that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the coefficient from the second part. That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) has \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a constant term with coefficient 20. Multiplying them together, 6 * 20 = 120. Yep, that seems right. I don't think I made any calculation errors here. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " In the expansion, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, if I set \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider both parts. But wait, the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means, in the entire product, I'm looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the other variables. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, their exponents won't be affected by the second part. So, the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), will contribute some coefficient, and when multiplied by the 6 from the first part, will give the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. Wait, but actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression multiplies each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is from the first part, then the coefficient from the second part would just be 1, because it's not affecting the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. The entire expression is the product of two expansions. So, the first expansion gives terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second gives terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are different variables, their exponents don't interfere with each other. So, when I multiply the two expansions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. But since the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that means the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, no, that's not correct either. Because each term in the product will have a combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, we can consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, but the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in that expansion would be when we set \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients from the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me check that again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's equivalent to taking the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and multiplying it by the entire second part, because each term in the second part will just tag along with the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, we can treat \\(c\\) as a separate variable, and the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) will include all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that's not the case because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be a term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient, perhaps it's considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 * \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we can treat the entire expression as a product and find the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, as I calculated earlier. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Wait, but let me confirm this with another approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanding this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. The sum of all coefficients in the second part is indeed \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), as I thought before. Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct answer. Let me just double-check my calculations. The binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is indeed 6. The sum of coefficients in the second part is 2^6 = 64. Multiplying them gives 6 * 64 = 384. Yep, that seems right.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, since the entire expression is the product of two expansions, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is this 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Because when you multiply by each term from the second expansion, each term will have a coefficient, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, when multiplied by any term in the second part, it will just contribute to the overall coefficient. But wait, no, that might not be correct. Because the second part is a separate variable, so when you multiply the two polynomials, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests that \\(c\\) terms are being considered as separate variables, so perhaps the coefficient is just 6, and the rest is part of other terms involving \\(c\\).

Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term will have a coefficient, and the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion times 6. Wait, but that would give the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times each power of \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the coefficients from the second expansion. But that seems a bit off because the problem might expect a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, when you multiply the two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, each of which has a coefficient.

Because each term in the second part contributes to the overall coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but the sum of all the coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, no, actually, that's not correct. Because when you have \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), \\(1/c^6\\).

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of the coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second part would be the sum of the coefficients from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: the entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\). When you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we are looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\). Then, for each such term, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), and the exponent of \\(c\\) would be \\(6 - 2m\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum over all possible \\(m\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Because for each \\(m\\), we have a term contributing to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the sum is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times 2^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, that seems to confirm the earlier result.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which might imply that we're considering \\(a^2b^2\\) as a standalone term, ignoring the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is 6, and the \\(c\\) part is separate. But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part, which would mean it's 6 times each term in the second expansion. But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by different variables. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the first part, because the second part involves \\(c\\). So, when you multiply, \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which has a coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part contributes to the coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me check with a smaller example to see if this makes sense. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{2}{2} = 1\\), and the sum of coefficients in the second part is \\(2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the product would be \\(1 \\times 2 = 2\\). Let's expand it: \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c)\\) is as is. So, the product is \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The term \\(a^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is \\(1 \\times (1 + 1) = 2\\), which matches our earlier calculation. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be \\(2 \\times (1 + 1) = 4\\), and the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) would be \\(1 \\times (1 + 1) = 2\\). So, this approach seems correct. Therefore, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake. Another way to think about it: the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\). When you expand this, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\), and the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are \\(4 - k\\) and \\(k\\), respectively. Now, we are looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so we set \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\). Now, for each \\(m\\) from 0 to 6, the term will have \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) as the coefficient, and the exponent of \\(c\\) will be \\(6 - 2m\\). But since we are only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum over all possible \\(m\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Since \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\), the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you have two independent variables, the coefficient of a term in one variable is the product of the coefficients from each part. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part and \\(c\\) is in the other, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part contributes to the overall coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that again gives us \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me check with another example to be sure. Suppose we have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 2, so the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be \\(1 \\times 2 = 2\\). Expanding, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is indeed 2, as in \\(2a c\\) and \\(2a/c\\), but wait, no, actually, each term has a coefficient of 1, so the coefficient of \\(a\\) is actually 1 times \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial, not a constant. So, perhaps my earlier approach is incorrect because the coefficient isn't a constant but a polynomial. Therefore, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by different variables. But that contradicts the earlier example where the coefficient became a polynomial.\n\nWait, but in the problem, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms from the second part, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient\", which suggests a numerical value, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a constant. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0.\n\nSo, let me approach it that way. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Now, in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we need the term where \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is when the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out. So, using the binomial theorem, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the answer would be 120. But wait, that contradicts my earlier conclusion of 384. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", but if it's in the entire product, which includes \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it would be 384. However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion, then it's 120. So, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. But since the problem didn't specify the power of \\(c\\), it's a bit ambiguous.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it's written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, it's a product of two expressions, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), and \\(1/c^6\\). So, each of these has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of the coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part contributes to the coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nBut if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 384. However, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. Since the problem didn't specify the power of \\(c\\), I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include all powers of \\(c\\), making the coefficient 384. But I'm not entirely sure because the problem statement is a bit ambiguous.\n\nWait, let me check another source or example to see how such problems are typically phrased. Usually, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a specific term in a product of expressions with different variables, it's considering the term as a standalone term, meaning that the other variables' exponents are zero. So, in this case, the problem would be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), in which case it's 384.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, without considering \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both expressions multiplied together. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think about it differently. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of the terms that multiply to give that specific term. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be obtained by multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part with any term from the second part, because the second part is in terms of \\(c\\). So, each term in the second part contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still unsure because the problem didn't specify the power of \\(c\\). If it had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 120. But since it just says \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient is 384. Therefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make a final check. Let me expand both parts separately and see.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nSecond, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply these two, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in \\(6a^2b^2c^6 + 36a^2b^2c^4 + 90a^2b^2c^2 + 120a^2b^2 + 90a^2b^2/c^2 + 36a^2b^2/c^4 + 6a^2b^2/c^6\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is \\(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n$\\boxed{384}$"

    "text": " That would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) in the binomial expansion because when \\(k = 2\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^{4 - 2}b^2 = \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\). Calculating the binomial coefficient, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), I think the terms involving \\(c\\) won't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. \n\nWait, no. Actually, when you multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), maybe we can treat the two parts separately. That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has several terms. But since we're multiplying the entire first expansion by the entire second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, no, that can't be right because that would make the coefficient 6 times something, but actually, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the second expansion has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me clarify. The original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, you'll have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m \\times (1/c)^{6 - m}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means we need to find all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). However, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, but that's not quite right because each term in the second expansion has its own coefficient. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms in the first polynomial that multiply together to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), every term in the second expansion will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, but each with their own coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nWait, but the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), and since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is indeed 64, as calculated by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach because the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), so maybe it's correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be 384, but maybe that's not what's intended. Let me check the problem again. It says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, it's possible that the problem is only concerned with the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But let me think again. \n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part (6) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from the second part, which is 64. So, the coefficient would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384. But let me make sure that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, meaning that the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. But to be thorough, let me write out the steps clearly.\n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\n\nWe are interested in the term where \\(k = 2\\), which is:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2}a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\nNext, consider the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The expansion of this is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nEach term in this expansion has a coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) and a power of \\(c\\) equal to \\(6 - 2m\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient from the first part (6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part.\n\nTo find the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, we can set \\(c = 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\nThus, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is:\n\n\\[\n6 \\times 64 = 384\n\\]\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought maybe the problem wanted the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, in that case, the answer is 384. Alternatively, if the problem had specified \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), the answer would be different, but as it stands, I think 384 is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2}a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The expansion is:\n   \\[\n   \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of coefficients from the second part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " That would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) in the binomial expansion because \\(4 - k = 2\\) when \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). But wait, the expression also includes \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, I think so because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), maybe the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms? Wait, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them out, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider how \\(a^2b^2\\) interacts with the terms from the second expression. Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so when we multiply it by any term from the second expansion, which involves \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times (1/c)^k\\), which would be \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, but the exponent of \\(c\\) can be anything? Wait, no, I think I'm misunderstanding. Wait, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because in the product, each term will have some power of \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any term from the second expression, so the total coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from both expansions. Wait, no, that's not correct because each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think we have to consider that when \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term from the second expression, each of those will contribute to the overall coefficient, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient remains the same? Wait, no, that's not right. Let me clarify. Let's denote the first part as \\(P = (a + b)^4\\) and the second part as \\(Q = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the product \\(P \\times Q\\) will have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^{-m}\\) for various \\(k\\) and \\(m\\). But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\). When we multiply this by each term in \\(Q\\), which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we get \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\text{(each term in Q)}\\). So, each term in \\(Q\\) is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when we multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(Q\\), we get terms like \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all the coefficients from the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term in \\(Q\\). Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a single term, so when we multiply it by each term in \\(Q\\), each of those products will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient from \\(P\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(Q\\). Wait, no, because each term in \\(Q\\) has a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(Q\\), each product will have \\(a^2b^2\\) times a different power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), would be the sum of all the coefficients from \\(Q\\) multiplied by 6. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the same as the coefficient in \\(P\\) because \\(Q\\) is being multiplied as a whole. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. Perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from \\(P\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(Q\\), but that's not correct because each term in \\(Q\\) is a separate term with different powers of \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any term from \\(Q\\), so the coefficient would be \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\). But the sum of coefficients in \\(Q\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\)? Wait, that seems plausible, but let me check. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That would make more sense because then we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, the coefficient would be \\(6\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, let's compute that. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the middle term when expanding, which occurs when the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). But wait, the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying the power of \\(c\\). So, maybe it's considering all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\), which is \\(6 \\times 2^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". It doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so perhaps it's considering the coefficient when \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expression, meaning the coefficient would be \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. But the sum of coefficients in the second expression is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), so the total coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then yes, it would be 384. But I'm a bit confused because usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term in a product, it's in the context of specific exponents for all variables, but here, \\(c\\) is another variable. So, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but since it's not specified, maybe it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of the second part. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering \\(a^2b^2\\) as a term on its own, and the rest can be any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expression, which is 64, giving 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) would be \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But that sum is \\(6 \\times 2^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Since the problem doesn't specify the power of \\(c\\), I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), meaning the total coefficient when considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the answer would be 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me check with a small example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) in this product would be \\(c + 1/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting us to consider that \\(c\\) is another variable, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of the second part, meaning the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. In that case, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\). That seems more reasonable. Let me confirm. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, we need to find all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. But since we're not considering the power of \\(c\\), perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 384. But given that the problem includes \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, to summarize, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, I think the answer is 120. But let me just make sure I'm not missing anything. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering \\(a^2b^2\\) as a term and any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. But I'm not sure. Wait, if I think about it, when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the first polynomial times any term in the second polynomial would just be the coefficient from the first times the entire second polynomial. So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it's actually the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times (1 + 1)^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). That makes sense because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those terms contributes to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then yes, it's 384. However, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for a specific \\(k\\), then it's different. Since the problem doesn't specify \\(c\\), I think it's expecting 384. But I'm a bit confused because usually, when you have multiple variables, the coefficient of a term would include all variables. So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be in \\((a + b + c)^n\\) or something similar. But given the problem as stated, I think the most reasonable interpretation is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, I'll go with that. But to be thorough, let me compute both possibilities. If it's \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120. If it's \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's 384. I think the problem is more likely asking for 384 because it's a standard way to present such problems, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, actually, let me think again. When you have an expression like \\((a + b)^4 (c + 1/c)^6\\), each term in the expansion is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^{-m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the product as \\(a^2b^2c^m\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-m}\\) for various \\(m\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the sum over all \\(m\\) of the coefficients from each term, which is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\), so the total coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Therefore, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, since the coefficient of any term in the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) summed over all terms is \\(2^6 = 64\\), the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " That would happen when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, substituting \\(k = 2\\), the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, this means that the coefficient I just found, 6, is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), right? So, does that mean that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? If that's the case, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not the coefficient multiplied by other terms. Maybe I need to think differently. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But actually, when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the entire second expression. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But in that case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is not a single number but a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, implying a numerical coefficient. So, maybe the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't make much sense because the entire expression includes \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems more complicated, and I think the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient. \n\nWait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, we're looking for the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), and the coefficient in front of that term. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so maybe I'm supposed to consider the entire expression and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). Wait, but that's not possible because the coefficient would be a function of \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expression, which would be 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, but that doesn't make sense because \\(c\\) is a separate variable. Wait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the entire expression. That makes more sense because then it's a specific term. So, let me approach it that way. \n\nSo, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which we've already determined has a coefficient of 6. Then, the term \\(c^0\\) in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the constant term. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nTo find the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can again use the binomial theorem. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 times 20, so 120. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But now, if the problem is asking specifically for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then the coefficient is 120. So, which is it? Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by all the terms in the second expression, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion, but that would result in a polynomial, not a single coefficient. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. As I calculated earlier, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64 when \\(c = 1\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. But that seems high, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, so maybe that's not the case. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a single number. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me try to parse it again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of that product. So, in the expansion, \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems odd because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and ignoring the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is part of the product. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), meaning that it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. As I calculated earlier, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384. \n\nBut let me check this again. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when \\(c = 1\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384. So, that would be the coefficient if we're considering all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then that's 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the problem differently. Let me think about the entire expansion. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\), each with their respective coefficients. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nWait, I think I need to clarify. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". If it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms, then in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, so 6 times 20 is 120. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean that it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. \n\nI think I need to decide which interpretation is correct. Since the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times 64, so 384. \n\nBut let me think again. When you have a product of two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expression, and each term in the second expression is multiplied by it. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times each term in the second expansion, which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, so that can't be right. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems complicated, and the problem is probably expecting a numerical answer. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and ignoring the second part because \\(c\\) is a different variable. But that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is the product of both parts. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to think of it as a single expression. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I were to multiply these out, each term in the expansion would be of the form \\(a^{k}b^{4 - k} \\times c^{m}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) ranges from -6 to 6 in steps of 2. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be when \\(k = 2\\), so \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times each term in the second expansion, which again is a polynomial in \\(c\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant. But that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is the product. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the second part is a separate expression, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6. But that seems unlikely because the entire expression is the product. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a number. \n\nWait, I think I'm stuck. Let me try to see if there's another approach. Maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a distraction. But that doesn't seem right because the problem includes both parts. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. \n\nI think that's the most plausible answer. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. So, which one is correct? Let me check again. \n\nIf the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. \n\nIf the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, so 6 times 20 is 120. \n\nSince the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384. \n\nBut to be sure, let me consider both possibilities. If I consider the problem as asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then the answer is 120. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 384. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, which would include all terms with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not a numerical coefficient. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant. But that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is the product. \n\nI think I need to conclude that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. \n\nWait, but I'm still not entirely sure. Let me check with a smaller example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\(a \\times c + a \\times 1/c + b \\times c + b \\times 1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\) would be \\(1 \\times (c + 1/c)\\). So, in that case, the coefficient is a polynomial. Therefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, which would be a polynomial. But since the problem is presented as a math problem expecting a numerical answer, I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nWait, I think I need to go back to the problem statement. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, so that can't be right. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant. But that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is the product. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the second part is a separate expression, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6. But that seems unlikely because the entire expression is the product. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the second part is a constant, but that's not the case because \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is not a constant. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a distraction. But that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is the product. \n\nI think I need to conclude that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But since the problem is expecting a numerical answer, perhaps the intended answer is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20, so 6 times 20 is 120. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the second part is a constant, but that's not the case. \n\nWait, let me try to think differently. Maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient is a polynomial. But since the problem is expecting a numerical answer, I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nI think I'll go with that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\), is 120. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) is 384. I'm still confused. \n\nLet me try to think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\). So, that would be 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nAlternatively, if I consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nI think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so 384. \n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Given that the problem is presented as a math problem expecting a numerical answer, I think the intended answer is 384. \n\nWait, but I think I'm making a mistake here. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. So, the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is not a single number but a function of \\(c\\). Therefore, the problem is probably asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nI think I need to settle on one answer. Given that the problem is presented as a math problem expecting a numerical answer, I think the intended answer is 120. \n\nBut to be thorough, let me check with specific terms. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part with coefficient 6. Then, in the second part, the term \\(c^0\\) has coefficient 20. So, when multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 120. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) is 384. I think I need to clarify. \n\nIf the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), then the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is expecting a numerical answer, I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nYes, I think that's the intended answer. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) is 120. \n\nWait, but the problem doesn't specify \\(c^0\\), it just says \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. \n\nI think I need to conclude that the answer is 384. \n\nBut I'm still not entirely sure. Let me try to see if there's another way to approach this. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the second part is a separate expression, so the coefficient remains 6. But that seems incorrect because the entire expression is the product. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a separate expression that doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But since the problem is expecting a numerical answer, I think the intended answer is 120, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). \n\nI think I'll go with that. So, the coefficient is 120. \n\nWait, but I'm still confused because the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\). Maybe I should stick with the initial approach. \n\nIn the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second part, the sum of all coefficients is 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nYes, I think that's the correct answer. So, the coefficient is 384. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. So, which one is correct? \n\nI think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 384. \n\nBut to be sure, let me check with specific terms. \n\nThe expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). \n\nThe expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). \n\nSo, when you multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times (c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6)\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is \\(6c^6 + 36c^4 + 90c^2 + 120 + 90/c^2 + 36/c^4 + 6/c^6\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps it's expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's the entire polynomial, which isn't a single number. \n\nTherefore, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nBut I'm still not entirely sure. Given the problem statement, I think the intended answer is 120. \n\nWait, but in the expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient is a polynomial. Therefore, unless the problem specifies a particular power of \\(c\\), the coefficient isn't a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6. \n\nBut that seems unlikely because the entire expression is the product. \n\nI think I need to conclude that the answer is 120, as that's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). \n\nWait, but in the initial problem statement, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, perhaps the answer is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial. But since the problem is expecting a numerical answer, I think the intended answer is 120. \n\nYes, I think that's it. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) is 120. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, we need to consider the constant term (where the power of \\(c\\) is 0) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " That would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) in the binomial expansion because \\(4 - k = 2\\) implies \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. But wait, the expression also includes \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), maybe the part with \\(c\\) doesn't affect this coefficient? Hmm, that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, because the entire expression is multiplied together. So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), maybe we just need to consider the coefficient from the first part, and the second part doesn't affect it. Wait, but that can't be right because the entire expression is a product, so when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms from the second expansion. Wait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, the problem might just be asking for the coefficient in front of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems too broad. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient when considering all variables, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so it's only concerned with the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts, and the \\(c\\) part can be anything. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient would then be a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, which is 6, and the rest is irrelevant. But that doesn't seem right because the problem includes both parts. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) because otherwise, the coefficient would depend on the power of \\(c\\). But the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to approach this differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, not an expression involving \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That makes more sense because then we're looking for a specific term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all specified. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply those two coefficients together. That sounds plausible. Let me check that approach. So, first, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. How do I find that? Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient is 120. Let me double-check that. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) for \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiplying them together gives 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), it would be different, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), and the expression also involves \\(c\\), I think it's safe to assume they want the coefficient when considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, but that wouldn't make sense because the coefficient would vary. Therefore, the most logical conclusion is that they want the coefficient when \\(c^0\\) is considered, making the term \\(a^2b^2\\) independent of \\(c\\). So, I think 120 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), so \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. But wait, that's just the first part. The entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to figure out how this affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, but actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), when I multiply the two expansions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that means we're only concerned with the part of the product that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\), and the rest can be ignored because they involve other variables. So, in other words, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it seems like the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those will contribute to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the final product. But wait, no, that might not be correct either because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second part, you're just adding more factors that don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), all those terms will add up their coefficients when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, how do I find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Well, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me double-check that. So, the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), when expanded, has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms like \\(c^6, 6c^4, 15c^2, 20, 15/c^2, 6/c^4, 1/c^6\\). Each of these terms, when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), will give terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, I need to consider all the terms where the product results in \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) term, that means we need to sum all the coefficients from the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will contribute its own coefficient to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, for example, \\(6a^2b^2 \\times c^6\\) contributes 6 to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 6c^4\\) contributes 36 to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), and so on. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we need to sum all these contributions. So, that would be 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second part). As I calculated earlier, the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms in each polynomial that multiply together to give that specific term. In this case, the specific term is \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the first polynomial, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second polynomial, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term is of the form \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to consider all the terms in the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. That seems correct. Alternatively, if I think about it as the product of two polynomials, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the constant term in the second polynomial, but wait, no, that's not right because the second polynomial isn't a constant. It has multiple terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial.

    "text": " That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, I think not, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, when I multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply as well, but since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate, their expansion won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is for the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because if I'm only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't care about the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply, but only when the exponents add up to the desired term. So, in this case, I'm looking for \\(a^2b^2\\) times something in the \\(c\\) terms. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's only considering the term where the \\(c\\) part is a constant, meaning \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the term would have a \\(c\\) component, but the problem is just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, the problem is probably considering the entire expression, but looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe I need to consider all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expansion. But that doesn't make sense because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expansion. Wait, no, that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be a term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so maybe it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps I can treat the two parts separately. That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and since the other part \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by it, the overall coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, but that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, because each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then I need to consider all the terms in the second expansion and multiply them by 6, but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's just 6, because the other expansion doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, that seems confusing. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, you'll have terms like \\((a^kb^{4 - k}) \\times (c^m (1/c)^{6 - m})\\), which simplifies to \\(a^k b^{4 - k} c^{m - (6 - m)} = a^k b^{4 - k} c^{2m - 6}\\). So, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts come from the first expansion, and the \\(c\\) parts come from the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would be when \\(k = 2\\) and \\(4 - k = 2\\), so that's the term from the first expansion, which is 6. But then, this term is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Wait, that can't be right because that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) be 6 times 64, which is 384? That seems high. Wait, no, that's not correct because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients of each term in the first expression are multiplied by the coefficients of each term in the second expression, and then you add them up for each term. But in this case, we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, as I thought earlier. So, 6 times 64 is 384. But wait, that seems too large. Let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and then multiplied by the entire second expansion, but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps it's just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) which gives terms up to \\(a^4b^0\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) which gives terms with various powers of \\(c\\), then when I multiply them, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, each of which has a coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that feels a bit off because I'm not sure if the problem is expecting that. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is just multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion, which would be the coefficient when \\(c^0\\). Let me check that. So, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). For the exponent to be zero, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of the constant term is 20. Therefore, when I multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by 20, so the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that makes more sense. So, I think I made a mistake earlier by considering the sum of all coefficients, but actually, since we're only interested in the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, we only need the constant term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120. Let me verify that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) has a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a constant term 20. So, when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. So, I think the answer is 120. But let me go through it again to make sure. First, expand \\((a + b)^4\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs at \\(m = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second expansion, resulting in a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. So, yes, I think 120 is the correct answer. I was confused earlier because I thought I had to consider all terms, but actually, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's just the product of the coefficient from the first expansion and the constant term from the second expansion. So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n$\\boxed{120}$"

But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so the entire expression is the product of two binomial expansions. So, I think I need to consider the expansion of both parts and then find the coefficient where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each. But wait, actually, the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) don't matter for this part? Let me think. Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps I can consider the entire expression as the product of two separate expansions and then find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. But actually, the \\(c\\) terms are separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so when I multiply the two expansions, the terms involving \\(c\\) won't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).

Wait, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that term would just be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that doesn't make sense because the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would involve different powers of \\(c\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), maybe we just multiply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems like it would give a coefficient that's a sum over all terms. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would then involve terms with different powers of \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which includes terms with various powers of \\(c\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a sum of terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. The entire expression is a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them together, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would accumulate all those coefficients. So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by evaluating the polynomial at \\(c = 1\\). So, if I plug \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, as I found. So, 6 times 64 is indeed 384. Alternatively, maybe I can approach it differently. Let me consider the entire expansion. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I expand both parts separately, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in the second expansion has a coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) and a power of \\(c\\) equal to \\(6 - 2k\\). Now, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, the resulting term will be \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum over all \\(k\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\), because \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and each term in the second part contributes \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is the coefficient from the first part, and the second part's expansion has coefficients \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\). So, when I multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for \\(k\\) from 0 to 6. But the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) from \\(k=0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\), as I found earlier. So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). That seems consistent with my earlier conclusion. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, giving 384. So, I think that's the correct answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of two expressions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check if I'm interpreting the problem correctly. Is the problem asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), or is it asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\)? The problem says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any specific power of \\(c\\). That means that in the product, we're looking for all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). So, each such term would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient, it would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Which again gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two polynomials. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first polynomial, and each term in the second polynomial is multiplied by it. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Since the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, as found by setting \\(c = 1\\), the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Yeah, that seems to make sense.\n\nWait, another way to check: let's compute the entire product up to the terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\). But that might be tedious, but maybe for a few terms. Let's see, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to \\(\\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\cdot (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Now, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, giving \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum over all \\(k\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). Wait, but that would be \\(6 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But \\(\\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\), so again, \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, that confirms it again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product being a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, that's 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not confusing coefficients with terms. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial. Since each term in the second polynomial contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the total coefficient is the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial times the coefficient from the first. So, yes, that's 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, I'm confident the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " That would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) in the binomial expansion. Let me calculate the coefficient for that term. The binomial coefficient when \\(k = 2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient I just found, 6, is going to be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) because the problem is only concerned with the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be 6 times whatever the constant term is in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), right? Because when you multiply 6 by the constant term, it will remain as part of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, while any other terms involving \\(c\\) would create other variables, which we aren't interested in for this problem. \n\nSo, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nI need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is the constant term. So, I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\). The binomial coefficient here is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, correct. Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20, so when you multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, so 6 * 20 is indeed 120. So, that seems right. \n\nIs there any chance I made a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients? Let me check \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) again. 4 choose 2 is (4*3)/(2*1) = 6, that's correct. And 6 choose 3 is (6*5*4)/(3*2*1) = 20, that's correct too. So, 6 * 20 is 120. Yeah, that seems correct. \n\nI think that's the answer then. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by expanding each part separately. Using the binomial theorem, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives a coefficient of 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\). The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 multiplied by something? Or is it more complicated? Hmm, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The other part of the expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the result will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot c^{-k}\\), where \\(k\\) is some exponent. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that means we're only interested in the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, right? Because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) in it, which isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, actually, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a separate term, so maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second part. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each factor. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first factor, and the second factor doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first factor is multiplied by every term in the second factor. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first factor times the sum of all coefficients in the second factor. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the second factor doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of the second factor. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first factor times the sum of all coefficients in the second factor. Because when you distribute, each term in the second factor gets multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting the variable to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second factor is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me check that again. Because actually, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term will have some power of \\(c\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, every term in the product will be of the form \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{something with } c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems high, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first factor is multiplied by each term in the second factor, and each of those terms will have their own coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of each term in the second expansion. Since the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which has terms with coefficients that are binomial coefficients. The sum of the coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so as I said before, it's 2^6 = 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think of it another way. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider that in the product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by every term from the second part. So, the coefficient will be 6 (from the first part) times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Since the second part's sum of coefficients is 64, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that each term in the product is a combination of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first expansion, and it's multiplied by every term in the second expansion, so the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), whose sum of coefficients is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Thus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, I think it does because the entire expression is a product of two expansions. So, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. But wait, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so maybe they are independent? Wait, no, because when you multiply the two expressions together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But the problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).

But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(2^6\\), since each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has coefficients that are either positive or negative, but actually, when you sum all coefficients, you set \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Wait, but that would make the coefficient 6 * 64 = 384, which seems high. But wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But since the second factor doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first factor is multiplied by each term in the second factor. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first factor times the sum of all coefficients in the second factor. Because each term in the second factor is a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second part. The sum of the coefficients in the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct because I think the second factor is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has terms with various powers of \\(c\\), but none of them affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, when you multiply the entire expression, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first expansion, and the second expansion contributes a factor that is just a constant (since it doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\)), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire product and looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely confident. Let me try another approach. Let me consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which is a term in \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient becomes the product of the two coefficients, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) is just one term, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. The sum of the coefficients in the second part is indeed \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem just says \\(a^2b^2\\), so it's considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion, so 6 * (sum of coefficients) = 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but I think that's correct because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term will have a coefficient, and all of those will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the total coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384. But let me check this with a smaller example to make sure. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). The second part is \\(c + 1/c\\). So, the product is \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2ab c + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product is zero because there are no \\(a^2b^2\\) terms. Wait, that's confusing. Wait, in this smaller example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because the second expansion doesn't have any terms with \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Wait, but in the original problem, the second expansion is separate, so when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which are in terms of \\(c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c\\), \\(a^2b^2/c\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the same as the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part contributes a coefficient that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, in the smaller example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 1 (from \\(a^2\\)) times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). But in reality, when you multiply \\((a + b)^2\\) by \\((c + 1/c)\\), you don't get an \\(a^2b^2\\) term because the second expansion doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Wait, so maybe my earlier reasoning was wrong. Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^n \\times (c + 1/c)^m\\), then the product will have terms that are combinations of the terms from each expansion. So, any term in the product will be of the form \\(a^kb^{n - k}c^l\\) or \\(a^kb^{n - k}/c^l\\), etc., depending on the exponents. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term would only come from the first expansion, and it would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part contributes a coefficient that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, in the smaller example, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 1 (from \\(a^2\\)) times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), so 2. But when I actually expand it, I don't see an \\(a^2b^2\\) term because the second expansion doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Wait, that's confusing. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 (c + 1/c)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the entire product, collect all terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), and the coefficient would be the sum of the coefficients from each of those terms. So, in the smaller example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there are no \\(a^2b^2\\) terms in the product. Wait, but that contradicts my earlier reasoning. Maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me think carefully. If I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), expanding it gives me \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). So, there are no terms with \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient is zero. So, in that case, my earlier reasoning was wrong. So, perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because the second expansion doesn't contribute any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. Wait, but that can't be right because in the original problem, the first part has \\(a^2b^2\\) and the second part has terms in \\(c\\), so when you multiply, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient in the first part times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. But in the smaller example, that would mean the coefficient is 1 * 2 = 2, but in reality, it's zero because there are no \\(a^2b^2\\) terms. So, maybe my approach is wrong. Let me try another approach. Maybe I should consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first expansion, and when multiplied by the second expansion, which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as the coefficient in the first expansion times the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\), so it doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the same as in the first expansion, which is 6, because the second expansion doesn't contribute any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. But that contradicts my earlier thought. Wait, but in the smaller example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) was zero, not 1, because the second expansion didn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. Wait, no, in the smaller example, the first expansion had \\(a^2\\), \\(2ab\\), and \\(b^2\\), and the second expansion had \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply, you get terms like \\(a^2c\\), \\(a^2/c\\), \\(2abc\\), etc., but no \\(a^2b^2\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero. Therefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because the second expansion doesn't contribute any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. But that can't be right because the first expansion does have \\(a^2b^2\\), so when you multiply by the second expansion, you should have terms with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in the first expansion times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but in the smaller example, that approach gave me 2, but the actual coefficient was zero. So, maybe I'm confusing the concept here. Let me try to think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are in terms of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part contributes a coefficient that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, in the smaller example, the coefficient would be 1 (from \\(a^2\\)) times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 2, so 2. But when I actually expand it, I don't get any \\(a^2b^2\\) terms. So, that suggests that my approach is wrong. Therefore, maybe the correct answer is zero because the second expansion doesn't contribute any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, so the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the first expansion, but since the second expansion is multiplied, it's not possible to have \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as in the first part times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. So, in the smaller example, it's 1 * 2 = 2, but when I actually expand, I don't see any \\(a^2b^2\\) terms. So, perhaps the confusion is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that it's considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But in the smaller example, that approach gave me 2, but when I actually expanded, I didn't get any \\(a^2b^2\\) terms. So, maybe the problem is that in the smaller example, the first expansion is \\((a + b)^2\\), which doesn't have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient is zero. Wait, no, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because there is no such term. So, perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384. But I'm still confused because in the smaller example, the coefficient was zero, even though the first expansion had \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\), but no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, maybe the key is that in the original problem, the first expansion has \\(a^2b^2\\), so when multiplied by the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion, which is 6, and the second expansion doesn't affect it because it doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). But that contradicts the idea that when you multiply, the coefficients multiply. Wait, no, because the second expansion is a separate variable, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as in the first part, because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would just be 6. But in the smaller example, the coefficient was zero because the first expansion didn't have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, in the original problem, since the first expansion does have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384. But I'm still not entirely sure. Let me try another approach. Let me consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(1\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because \\(1\\) would represent the constant term. Wait, but \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) doesn't have a constant term. Let me check that. The general term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(1\\) in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) times 20 (the constant term in the second part), which is 120. But wait, that contradicts my earlier reasoning. So, now I'm more confused. Let me think again. If I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, I need to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, and the second expansion must contribute a term that is a constant, i.e., \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the term would have a \\(c\\) component, which would make it \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) instead of just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the only way to get a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\) is if the second expansion contributes a constant term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the coefficient of the constant term in the second expansion. So, in this case, that would be 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term 20, you get \\(20a^2b^2\\), which is the term you're interested in. All other terms from the second expansion would have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so they would create terms like \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120. Wait, but earlier I thought it might be 384, but that was when I considered the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But now, I realize that only the constant term contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term without any \\(c\\) component. So, the correct coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Let me verify this with the smaller example. If I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the constant term in the second part. But in this case, the first part is \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), which doesn't have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient is zero. The second part, \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\), has a constant term? Wait, no, because when \\(k = 0.5\\), which isn't possible, so there's no constant term. So, the constant term is zero, which aligns with the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) being zero. So, that makes sense. Therefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " That would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) in the binomial expansion because when \\(k = 2\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^{2}b^{2}\\). So, the coefficient here is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, I wonder if I need to consider this part when finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so maybe the second part doesn't affect the coefficient we're looking for. Let me think. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part doesn't involve \\(c\\), when I multiply it by any term in the second part, it will just get multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) part at all because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so it's just 6 times 1, since the second part is being multiplied as a whole. Wait, but that might not be correct because the second part could have multiple terms. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand this, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\) multiplied by \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in the product will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^{k}c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that means we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), which we already found gives us \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, regardless of the value of \\(m\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in each term where \\(k = 2\\), but the \\(c\\) part can vary. Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering the entire product, and the \\(c\\) terms are part of the expansion, but since the problem doesn't specify any particular \\(c\\) term, maybe we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. In other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expansion, because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But that seems a bit odd because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be when we set \\(c = 1\\), which gives us \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, that seems high. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the product as 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be present with a coefficient that is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second polynomial. The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), if we set \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) is to the power of 0. That would make sense if the problem is considering all variables. Let me check that. So, if we want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we need to find the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, we would need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To do that, we can use the binomial theorem again. The general term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by 20 from the second part, giving a total coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. But wait, the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, maybe it's just 6, because it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that seems unlikely because when you multiply by the second part, each term in the first part is multiplied by the entire second expansion. So, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm a bit confused because usually, when you have multiple variables, the coefficient would be specific to each variable's exponent. So, perhaps the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible \\(c\\) exponents. But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by any term. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the product as \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct answer. Alternatively, if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, then it's 6, but I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient in the entire product, so 384. Wait, but let me check again. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) separately, then when I multiply them together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Since the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. Alternatively, if the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's 384. Wait, but let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, but I think that's not correct because the entire product is considered. So, I think the correct answer is 384. But to make sure, let me think of it another way. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient in the first part, multiplied by the entire second expansion. So, if we think of it as a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. Maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present with coefficients multiplied by each term in the second expansion. However, if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120. Since the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Hmm, I'm a bit confused now. Let me try to see if the problem is from a textbook or something. Wait, the problem is just given as is, so I have to interpret it based on standard conventions. In most cases, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a term in a product of expressions, it's considering the entire product, so if the term doesn't involve another variable, it's just the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, in this case, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, I think the answer is 384. But to double-check, let me consider a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it's \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) in this product would be \\(1 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), but if we're considering the coefficient as a numerical value, then we need to set \\(c = 1\\), which gives 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2. Similarly, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384. Therefore, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Each term in this expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\n3. **Determine the contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\):**\n   Since the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), we consider the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives:\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 64\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{384}\n\\]"

Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, is that right? Because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times whatever the coefficient is in the second part when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply as well. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the coefficient of the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that's being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when we multiply, the coefficient would just be 6 times 1, because the second part's expansion doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. When you have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the entire expression is a product of two polynomials. Each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second part multiplied by 6. Wait, no, that can't be right because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply by any term in the second part, it would add a term involving \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would just be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that doesn't make sense because the second part isn't being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\); rather, each term is multiplied separately. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we have to consider that the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is when it's multiplied by a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). But \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) only has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so the only way for \\(a^2b^2\\) to appear without any \\(c\\) terms is if it's multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me compute that. Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), which is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and it's multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, so yes, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. So, the coefficient should be 120. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two coefficients because the variables are independent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, so when you multiply them, you get 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Yeah, that makes sense. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).

But in this case, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other expression is in terms of \\(c\\), which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right either. Let me think again. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = A\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = B\\). Then, the product is \\(A \\times B\\). When I expand this, each term in \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(B\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Wait, but in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then yes, it would be the coefficient in \\(A\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\). Because each term in \\(B\\) has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times each power of \\(c\\). But I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\). Wait, but let me make sure. Let me think of it this way: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients from each polynomial where the exponents add up to the desired term. But in this case, the desired term is \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\), which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in \\(B\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\). Because each term in \\(B\\) contributes to the coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, I need to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiply it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, I found that the coefficient is 6. Now, I need to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, in this case, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me think again. The sum of coefficients in \\(B\\) is 64, so when I multiply \\(A\\) by \\(B\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two expansions. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the total contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(B\\), which is 6*64=384. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product, and since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(B\\), which is 64. So, 6*64=384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the second part doesn't affect this term? Let me think. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, it's just constants multiplied by powers of \\(c\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will just be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't contribute any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) factors, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's actually the coefficient from the first part times the entire second part, because the second part doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. Wait, but that can't be right because the second part is raised to the 6th power, which would give us various terms in \\(c\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part times the constant term from the second part, if such a term exists. Hmm, so perhaps I need to consider whether the second part has a constant term. Let me check that. The expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the constant term in the second part is 20. So, going back, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from the first part times the constant term from the second part. So, that's 6 times 20, which is 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. \n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, the first part gives me 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part, when expanded, has a constant term of 20, so when I multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part gets multiplied by the constant term from the second part, resulting in 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, if I were to consider the entire expansion, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is indeed 120. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion is found by first determining the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are numerical values, not expressions. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of c, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some k, but the problem as stated just says \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering only the terms where c terms are not present, but that would be only if k=0, but that's not necessarily the case.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is considering \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of c.

So, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of the entire expression, treating c as a separate variable, so that the coefficient would be a polynomial in c. But that seems a bit odd. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of c, but that would require more context. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a single number.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering c as a separate variable, but then the coefficient would be a polynomial in c.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of c, meaning that the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a single number.

But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the constant term with respect to c. So, if that's the case, then the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, let me proceed under that assumption.\n\nFirst, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the constant term, we can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of c is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for k, we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found earlier. And the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when we multiply these two parts together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But we're only interested in the term where the exponent of c is zero, which is the constant term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in the second expansion is 6 times 20, which is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. But the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so perhaps it's considering the coefficient without regard to c, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in c, which doesn't make sense for a coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the constant term with respect to c, which would be 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, then it's actually the product of the two expansions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part, which includes various powers of c. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But that seems odd because coefficients are usually numerical. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where c is raised to the zero power. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120. That seems more plausible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but without considering c, which would be 6 times the entire expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient is a number. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a number.

Let me try to think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering the entire expression as a product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each part where the exponents of a and b are 2. So, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient is 6, as we found. Now, the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a separate expansion, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve c, the other part is just a multiplier. Wait, no, because when you multiply the two expansions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes various powers of c. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial in c, not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 times the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating c as a separate variable, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which isn't a number. Therefore, I think the intended answer is 120, assuming that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nSo, to summarize, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations. The binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is indeed 6. For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). Setting the exponent to zero, \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120.\n\nBut the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so perhaps it's intended to ask for the constant term with respect to c, which would be 120. Therefore, the final answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I'm not missing anything else. Is there a possibility that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) could come from other terms in the expansion? For example, could there be a cross term where a and b are multiplied by c terms? No, because in the expansion, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but \\(a^2b^2\\) only comes from the first part, so when multiplied by any term from the second part, it would just carry the coefficient. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of c, it would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because coefficients are numbers. Therefore, the only plausible interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both parts:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " That would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) in the expansion because when \\(k = 2\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). Let me calculate that coefficient. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is the number of combinations of 4 things taken 2 at a time. I remember that \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider the entire product. However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That suggests that the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) might not affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, maybe I can treat \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) separately. Since they are multiplied together, the coefficients from each part multiply when combining terms. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) will just contribute a factor that we can multiply by the coefficient from the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) part. So, if I can find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which I found to be 6, and then multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, but wait, that might not be correct because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when multiplying, the terms in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) will multiply with each term in the first expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the terms from the second expansion will just contribute a factor that we need to consider. Wait, perhaps I can think of it as the product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, is that right? Let me think again. If I have two expressions, say \\(A = a^2b^2 \\times k\\) where \\(k\\) is some constant, and \\(B = \\text{something}\\), then the product \\(A \\times B\\) would be \\(a^2b^2 \\times k \\times B\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it's just \\(k\\) times the entire expansion of \\(B\\). But that doesn't make sense because \\(B\\) includes terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables. So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be multiplied by each term in \\(B\\), which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), etc. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, that seems plausible. Because each term in the second part is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient times \\(c^k\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients in the second part multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. \n\nWait, but actually, no. Let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, the first polynomial has terms with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of those involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, each of those terms contributes their coefficient to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. \n\nWait, but that might not be correct. Let me clarify. Suppose I have two polynomials: \\(P(a, b) = \\sum p_{ij}a^ib^j\\) and \\(Q(c) = \\sum q_k c^k\\). Then the product \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\) would be \\(\\sum p_{ij}q_k a^ib^j c^k\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be the sum over all \\(k\\) of \\(p_{22} q_k\\), where \\(p_{22}\\) is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\), which is 6, and \\(q_k\\) are the coefficients from \\(Q(c)\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), each term contributes its coefficient to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but since \\(c\\) is a different variable, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the product of the coefficient from \\(P(a, b)\\) and the sum of all coefficients from \\(Q(c)\\). \n\nWait, that seems to make sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times\\) (sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). Now, how do I find the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Well, the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Is the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) indeed 64? Let me check that. When \\(c = 1\\), the expression becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), which is correct. So, the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and since the second part is raised to the 6th power, each term in the product will have a coefficient that's multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient is just 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the entire expression is a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 times 64. \n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that each term in the product is a combination of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part contributes a coefficient that gets multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. \n\nSo, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe I should actually compute the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) to make sure that the sum of coefficients is indeed 64. \n\nSo, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for each term. So, the sum of coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), which matches what I thought earlier. So, the sum of coefficients is indeed 64. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial step, let me confirm the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), so that's correct. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nI think that's the answer. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " That would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) in the binomial expansion, right? Because when \\(k = 2\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^{4 - 2}b^2 = \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\). Let me calculate \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). That's 4 choose 2, which is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but wait, actually, no. Because when you multiply two expressions together, the coefficients multiply for each term. But in this case, we are only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the rest of the terms from the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), might not affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because they involve different variables. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part? But wait, that doesn't make sense because the second part is a separate expression, so when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems complicated. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. \n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. So, in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first polynomial and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the second, the variables in the product will be \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply the two polynomials, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second polynomial is multiplied by each term in the first, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficients from the second polynomial will just add up when multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Let me correct myself. Actually, no, because each term in the product is a combination of a term from the first polynomial and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first polynomial, and when you multiply by the second polynomial, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the second polynomial will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, in order for the product to have a term \\(a^2b^2\\), the second polynomial must contribute a term that is \\(c^0\\), i.e., a constant term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. \n\nSo, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me figure that out. \n\nAgain, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. \n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, because when you multiply two terms, their coefficients multiply. So, that would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). \n\nSo, 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when we multiply the two polynomials together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, but only the term with \\(c^0\\) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) term, making it \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), which are different terms. Therefore, only the constant term in the second polynomial contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nHmm, that seems right. Let me think if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe using multinomial coefficients or something else, but I think the approach is correct. \n\nWait, another way to think about it: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, in this case, since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which only comes from the first polynomial, and the second polynomial must contribute a term that is 1 (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), so the coefficient is indeed the product of 6 and 20, which is 120. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\).
